Left-Wingers
Uphold Cause
In THRUST

THRUST, W&L’s new liberal club,
began its official existence at an or-|
ganizational meeting last Monday |
night. According to its constitution, |
THRUST has been organized to
represent the liberal and moderate |
political element at W&L, to bring
controversal issues before the in-|
tellectual community and to active-|
ly support issues and candidates it)
considers desirable.

THRUST was conceived last spring |
by ZBT junior Sydney Lewis, who,
wih a nucleus of supporters, felt!
that the politieal balance at W&L
was excessively weighted toward the |
right. |

Until last spring, the only W&L
political organizations were the!
right-wing Conservative Society and’
the just slightly less conservative
Young Republicans.

During he summer, Lewis, Roger
Sennott, Jeffrey Skarda, and John
Klegg operated an organizational
committee. The committee formu-
lated plans and raised a small
amount of money from alumni.

At matriculation, THRUST had an
information and registration table in
Payne Hall and obtained about thir-
ty dues-paying members.

Then at the Monday meeting,
THRUST Officially adopted its con-
stitution and elected officers.
Lewis was chosen to be the first
president, Roger Sennoit was
elected vice-president, Richard
Margolies was elected recording
secretary, Jeffrey Skarda was
elected corresponding secretary,
and William Surbaugh was elect-
ed treasurer.

After electing officers, THRUST
voted to officially support the
Johnson-Humphrey ticket. A motion
to support Robert Kennedy in the
New York senate race failed, how-
ever.

Thrust is now engaged in a voter
registration drive for Rockbridge |
County, and it plans to begin a)
letter-writing campaign soon. Later, |
THRUST hopes to bring eminent
liberal speakers to W&L.

In its voter registration drive,
THRUST members are working with
colored students from Lexington’s
Downinng High School. Specifically, |
the drive involves a door-to-door)
campaign to convince people to)
register and to transport them to)
the registration bureau in Lexington. |
In a week's work, THRUST has)
registered approximately forty vot-
ers. On November 3, THRUST will
have poll watchers to make sure |
that registered voters actually vote. |

Air Conditioning, Enlarged Size
‘Promised For 1965 Delt House

Jim Slay, president of the W&L
chapter of Delta Tau Delta fraterni-
ty, has revealed tentative plans for
the construction of a new house to
replace the building destroyed by
fire on September 5. According to
Lexington fire chief Peyton Craft,
the fire, of as-yet undetermined or-
igin, left the house and everything
in it a “total loss.” The Delts have
relocated at the old SPE house on
Meyers Street.

The present sehedule calls for
completion of the new house by May
or June of 1965, assuring Delta Tau
Delta a permanent home before the
’65-'66 school year. Slay stated that
the new house would probably be
built at the same location, although
the fraternity is considering the pur-
chase of a lot. The new house will
be built on the same general archi-
tectural plans as the old, but the
chapter will
minor changes. The front rooms
will be larger, bedroom capacity will
be increased and a party room in
the basement will open into the din-
ing room through felding doors. Air
conditioning and other such im-
provements are planned.

The chapter has started replacing

Pledging Increases Markedly
Rush System Produces Gain

Under the influence o fa new rush system, this year’s pledging showeda marked increase
of 8 per cent with 79 per cent of the freshmen pledging fraternities as compared with 71 per
cent last year. Another indication of this rush week success is that only 84.4 per cent of the
freshman class registered for rush.

Steve Hibbard, IFC president, stated that that the IFC was very satisfied with the result of

the new rush system. He further*

stated that on the first day of open
houses there was an uneven distri-
bution of freshmen, but the next day
this evened out.

Most of the houses got from be-
tween 10 to 20 pledges. Hibbard
stated that “This tends to indicate
that this new rush system has defi-
nite advantage over the old; how-
ever, there are many points of con-
tention that will be discussed in
next Friday’s issue.”

Sigma Chi got the most pledges,
22, and ZBI followed wih 21. The

A Word to Freshmen: You'll Learn

By now 338 new ones have come to W&L,
have looked at the old buildings and the new,
have met the people across the hall and on
the other floor, have heard from the presi-
dent and the deans, have conferred frankly
or superficially with their dorm counselors,
have pledged fraternities, and started classes.
They’re beginning to know their way around
the campus now, but they are still very ob-
viously freshmen. They still have an awful lot
to learn.

They realize how much they don’t know
and how little they do know, but it doesn’t
seem to bother them now. They are eager to
find out, and they feel that they have come
to the right place for learning. In fact, ask
one of them why he has come to college—to
W &L—at all, and he will say: I came to learn.

And freshmen, you are right. You will
learn here. But many of the things you seek
you will not find, while in their place you will
learn things you never suspected and things
you never would choose to know.

HA

Ww

If you have formed an image of W&L as
“College,” then you will learn very early to
put that image aside. For “College” is a hazy
mixture of ivied walls, fatherly and inspir--
ing professors, football weekends, all night
bull sessions, fraternal revelry, enlightening
bouts with knowledge, and a community of
scholars. This ideal verson of “College” may
indeed exist somewhere, but it is not totally
intact here at W&L. Washington and Lee is
an institution unique to itself, and it is very
capable of teaching its own ways to all those
who come to it.

You will learn as the year wears on that
The Thing at W&L is Greek affiliation. Oh
yes, make your grades, get some knowledge,
but just be sure you don’t miss pledge meet-
ings, or ball games, or lunch, or parties,
ot pledge raids, or whatever else you are told
to attend. You will learn what pressure is, and
you will bend to it. It will be disheartening to
watch you, freshmen, as the vows you made
before coming to college give way when put
to the test. But then, it happens every year.

Learning at W&L

How much you will learn at W&L! It
will be an eye-opening day when you first real-
ize that, contrary to all you feared, you are
as intelligent as those around you, that the
genius next door who made atomic reactors all
summer is now making poorer grades than
you, that the entering freshman class does not
consist of 337 superhumans and you.

It may shock you when you realize that
you are actually capable of doing college
work, but then the shock will be greater for
those who learn that they do not have what
it takes. But before long most of you will
realize that college is not as hard as you were
led to believe, that carmming the night before
is often good for an A, that rhetorical verbo-
sity goes a long way on themes and papers,
that a C can sometimes be made without any
effort at all, and that in some courses an
acquaintance with classroom notes will get
you a good mark even if you haven't read the
assigned material. But you will also become
acquainted with the all-night stand, the mental
blackout during a test, and perhaps even fail-
ure of a critical course. You will learn the
blind emphasis placed on good grades here,
and you'll probably go along, without trying
to determine the correlation between grades
and knowledge.

If you’ re looking for stimulating company,
you will find that you must search for it at
W&L. You will learn to speak of girls, grades,
Greeks and good times in order to be able to
converse here, and in looking around you will
recall that many people are either incapable
of expanding their conversational range or
they simply never let on. If you then turn
for mental prodding to your instructors, you
will learn that the faculty will reach out on a
personal basis to students, but only to those
who make the initial effort.

:
-

You will also learn to question your re-
ligious beliefs while you are at W&L, but you
probably won't begin that until you are soph-

omores. You'll learn how much harder it is to
go to church by yourself rather than with
the family. You will discover that the mes-
sage at church is dull and repetitive compared
to the message of the classroom. You will
find too that the church and the classroom
often conflict. You will learn, in a year or two,
to laugh at and nonchalanty relate sacrilegious
jokes which would shock you now, although
for a time you will apologize for each one you
tell. And no one knows just what you will

find in the end.

What else will you learn at W&L? You'll
learn to drink, yes, even those of you who
swear now you will never touch a drop. Yes,
even you. Some of you will learn to smoke
in a manner calculated to be devastating but
which is in reality comic.

You will learn to say that the Commons
is the only spot in the world where, after

two months, the roast beef, the tuna casserole,
the pork chops, the baked ham, and the ice’
cream all taste exactly alike. About a fourth

of you will learn after taking freshman chem-
istry and German, that you didn’t really want
to be a doctor at all. You'll learn to say
“sharp,” “lizard,” “‘cool’”’, “gross,” and “T’m
not believing that,’’ with every other phrase.

And if you stop to think, you will learn
the underlying futility which comes from liv-
ing in a generation and a country whose high-
est cause is to provide itself with material

things and with the Good Life.

Other Things To Learn

But there are other things to learn at W&L
and perhaps some of them will stick. Men
here can tell you of Plato, of Shakespeare, of
Dewey, and of Conrad. You can slowly learn
to realize that the deepest utterances of the
heart can be said as meaningfully in another
language. You could walk out of geology or
biology class one day and understand for the
first time what you have seen a thousand times.

You might learn what a truly unlimited
instrument the slide rule is. Some of you will
learn a lot about the mechanism which is the
human body, and somewhere along the line
you will be struck with the responsibility un-
dertaken by those who would heal. Ocas-
sionally pure hogwash, in the guise of formal
scholarship, will be given to you in the class-
room, but perhaps you will learn to distin-
guish the preposterous from the legitimate.
And you can learn invaluable lessons from
those around you who throw up in W&L’s
face their own enthusiasm of spirit It may

not be incorrect to believe that you might even

learn to think for yourself, and to be yourself.

It is true that the petty, snobbish, the
cruel, the boring, the shallow, the superficial,
the trivial, the barren pursuits are much in
evidence here, and they will certainly exert
the most pressure upon you as a student. But
the open mind, the sincere intellect, the sin-
cere interest, does exist at W&L, and where
it exists it makes room for itself. You will
learn here, but what you learn is your de-
cision.

L£
ss

There is a great discrepancy between what
W&L would teach to her students and what
the school actually imparts. The fault lies
partly with W&L’s provincialism, but most
of W&L’s pettiness comes from its students
who came here fully as unaffected as you,
freshmen, but who succumbed to the teaching
of the system and who are now dedicated to
passing it on to you. With each fall comes
the only real hope for change at W&L and
usually the hopes dies unrealized. But another
fall has come, and now you are the hope of
Washington and Lee.

It all depends on what you learn and what
you take to heart. You will have many teach-
ers, and your lessons will be numerous. What
you learn, however, will ultimately depend
upon you and on the kind of person you want
to be. It is in your hands now, and although
those of us who have been here, who have
seen, and who are concerned will help
wherever we are able, we must largely content
ourselves with nursing what is at one time our
greatest hope and our greatest fear: knowing
that you will learn.

 

  

 

Washington and Lee Expansion Plans

Could Already Be Highly Developed

By WARREN MONTGOMERY |

President Cole’s proposal for a
Lee College adjacent to the present
school is not only of great signifi-
cance, it is probably closer than
we think in reality. The president
of a major university would prob-
ably not reveal ideas of such mag-
nitude unless definite planning was
already underway. Assuming, then,
that the next ten years will bring
a new W&L, what can we tell about
its form?

Essentially, the plan presented by
Dr. Cole is to build a new college
on grounds now occupied by Lib-
erty Hall and the athletic fields.
The present school would revert to
its old name of Washington College
and the new facilities would be
called Lee College. Both institutions
would comprise a greater Washing-
ton and Lee University under a

 

 

common administration; however,
they would operate as independent
units in duplicating many required
courses. Freshman and sophomore
courses would probably be similar
in both schools, but there would be
a convenient transfer system for
the upper classes.

No one can doubt that the realiza-
tion of this plan would work great
changes on W&l.. Whether these
changes would be beneficial, how-
ever, is a matter of uncertainty.

Intellectual Expansion

There is a great deal to be said
for the two-college plan. Primarily,
the plan would enable W&L to
expand as an educational unit and
as an intellectual community. A
school like W&L with its strong
traditions and its friendly, secure
atmosphere cannot exist with more
than around 1500 students. At the

From W&L’s Theatre Go-ers

By JAMES JENNINGS |
Shakespeare ordered his players to!
speak their lines loud and clear
without shouting and to speak with
emotion but to use restraint. Rich-
ard Burton does just this in the part
of Hamlet.

Burton’s Hamlet as directed by
John Gielgud is a production that
' es » calls for nothing
but praise. We are

impressed with
Claudius in his
attempt to be a
good king and
must feel some
sympathy for him
in his certain

doom. The queen
draws on sympa-
thy when she
shows herself loy-|
al to her son and
confused by Hamlet's not accepting
Claudius as her new husband.

Ophelia and Laertes turn in ex-
cellent performances as we see their
family brought to a tragic end by
their entanglement in Hamlet's af-'
fairs.

The most notable supporting role
is that of Polonius. Hume Cronyn!
plays the meddling old courtier in
a most delightful manner. We
laugh at his long-winded demands
for brevity and his conversation
with Hamlet, and we are amused
by his claims of omniscience. The
old man seems to have some in-
sight, and a good mind, but he is
on the wrong track, so that he
never develops as the philosopher or
the omniscient character as found in
other plays of Shakespeare. Never-
theless, Cronyn makes Polonius
seem very much alive and, at times,
threatens to the show from
Burton, a feat that is impossible

 

steal

There are many interpretations of
Hamiet, and almost as much has
been written on this play as has
been written about the Bible. Bur-
ton, in his interpretations, makes
Hamlet a very emotional young
man, much troubled and confused
by his father’s death and his moth-
er’s hasty marriage He makes it
obvious that he is going to feign
madness and not that he is mad
| However, he is very emotional even
iwhen he is himself and is prone to

tanturms, when he jumps into
Ophelia’s grave, or when he abuses
his mother and slays Polonius

Does Hamlet love Ophelia? Bur-
thinks He kisses her

receives gladly in their

“us

does
her

ton he

and

scenes when Polonius and Claudius
are looking on. Only after he sees
that the two men are present does
he abuse her, either because he
thinks he is helping Claudius or be-
cause he must keep up his show.
From this point on Ophelia is caught
up in the plot and madness and
death tie in Polonius and Laertes.
We see that Hamlet truly loves her,
but the game has moved too far to
do anything about it. Many must
pay for the jealousy and ambition of
one man.

 

same time, a school that is content
to maintain a status quo soon stag-
nates. President Cole’s two-college
plan may allow us to maintain a
small school atmosphere while
physically expanding.

Furthermore, a larger University
means more teachers and more
equipment, which in turn mean a
finer standard of education. One col-
lege might specialize in sciences and
the other in arts, both achieving a
higher degree of excellence through
concentration on limited fields of

study.
Also, a larger university would
bring students of more diverse

backgrounds to W&L, adding more
to the common experience of each
student.

Finally, an enlargement of facili-
ties would help fulfill our obliga-
tion to American education to try
to accommodate more of the rising
tide of qualified college applicants.

Tendencies Toward Division

There are, however, several good
arguments against a two-college ex-
pansion. One is that the plan would
create two fiercely competitive and
alien institutions, thereby destroy-
ing the old W&L altogether. This
contention might be answered, how-
ever, by the examples of Oxford,
Cambridge, and Harvard—institu-
tions which are segmented into col-
leges but which maintain their so-
lidarity anyway. Washington College
and Lee College would be geograph-
ically adjacent, under a common ad-
ministration, and possessing a com-
mon  heritage—conditions which
have held Oxford, Cambridge, and
Harvard together. At any rate, a
little competition would stimulate
the development of both schools.

Another very pertinent objection
has been raised regarding the social
lives of 3000 or more students. The
town of Lexington offers almost no
social life. If many more students
are to be added, the university
should make plans for activities to
occupy their spare time. A student
union with beer on tap, weekly com-
bos, bowling alleys, music rooms,
pool tables, and arranged transporta-
tion to the girls’ school would al-
most be a necessity.

Value of W&L Image

Finally, it is said that the two-
college plan would destroy the
time-hallowed W&L image. Possibly
so, but can W&L afford to always
maintain the unchanging image of
a snug, isolated, small college? As
much as we might wish to keep our
present comfortable existence, the
changing times might bring obscuri-
ty if our growth ceases.

As lresident Cole pointed out in
his address last week, W&L needs
to grow, but it must do so without
sacrificing the quality of the existing
school. Whether this can be done,
and how it can done are the
problems that the administration and
trustees must solve as they plan
for a new Washington and Lee.

Junior Condescends To Provide
Memoirs, Maxims & Sage Advice

By BRUCE W. RIDER

In the first edition of the Ring-|
tum Phi we wish to direct our at-.

tention and matchless editorial skill
to the freshmen, the class of 1968

And as to the 1964 Presidential
Campaign to the contrary, we sin-
cerely hope there will be a 1968.

Originally we had planned to im-
part some sage advice to the fresh-
men, in the hope that they might
avoid some of the pitfalls of our
own freshman year.

On second thought, believe
that the freshmen have been given
enough Good Sound Advice in the
past two weeks to last them at least
to 1968, after which date the Uni-
versity is no longer responsible

And on the third thought we rath-
er enjoyed those aforementioned pit-
falls and we feel that they are an
integral part, as they the

Would you like to have a dime

I myself would ettle for
2'2c for every freshman who is
taking geology because he thought
it would be easy

and happy to have a fresh presence

that this is the longest concrete foot-

At least this year the new men
will not be wearing the immortal

‘Go’ Team, ‘Hungry Dogs’ Give
New Look to ‘Green’ Generals

By JOHNNY GRAHAM

Can a school that loses its entire starting team of
the previous year make a success of its next football
season?

This is the question for the Washington and Lee
football Generals this fall, but head coach Lee Mc-
Laughlin expresses reserved optimism that the team
can overcome its inexperience.

“We are a green team, but the boys have been work-
ing hard and the spirit is good,’ McLaughlin said. “We
are not a ‘holler’ team, but I feel that spirit is shown
by how the team hits and works.”

The Generals will use the new substitution rule ex-
tensively this season, with a three platoon system set
on a different basis than in previous years.

The “Blue” team, or first string will go both ways
with the exception of two substitutions which are per-
mitted each time the ball changes hands. The “Go”
team is a group of offensive specialists while the “Hun-
gry Dogs” specialize in defense.

Larry Craig, last year’s third team quarterback, is
handling the signal calling duties. Joining him in the
backfield are fullback John Anthony, a good worker
who saw considerable action last season, and Skip
Chase, a veteran left halfback whom McLaughlin de-
scribes as “a strong runner and a fine blocker with a
lot of hustle.”

Roundup of Opposition

 

Number four, or wing back, has three capable Blue
team players—co-captains Bill David and Tommy
Crenshaw, and junior Billy Andrews.

At center, Jeff Novinger is sidelined with a broken
hand. Chuck Long, whom McLaughlin said had played
his best football this fall, will start.

The guard positions will be held down by Joe Mil-
ler, a junior who logged the most playing time last
year of any Blue team member, and Curt Jernigan,
converted from end in spring practice.

Another converted end, Starke Sydnor, holds down
one tackle position, with Jack Kelly manning the
other.

Tersh Baker, who started last year when John
Madison was injured, is at one end, while Bob Barclay,
the team’s punter, is at the other. Barclay is the
smallest man on the line.

When the Blue team switches from offense to de-
fense, Billy Andrews and Chuck Staples will replace
Anthony and Chase.

The Generals will also feature a new innovation
in this era of the specialist. Assistant manager Cary
Green, a sophomore who kicks field goals and extra
points as a hobby, has been working out on his own.
Using his own square-toed kicking shoes, Green has
practiced several times with defensive pressure and
shows promise of becoming a top flight kicker.

Generals Picked Over Once-Beaten Yellow Jackets

By GUY UNANGST

Crushed last Saturday by Susque-
hanna, 42-0, Randolph-Macon’s
young team—it has only three sen-
iors and a coach in his first season—
plays host tomorrow to Washington
and Lee.

If W&L can contain “lonely end”
Bill Gorham and run past sopho-
more tackle Bill Baumeister, it
should repeat its victory of last year,
though not by 1963’s 28-0 count.

Yellow Jackets coach Ted Keller
favors a passing offense with quar-
terbacks Charlie D’Alessandro, and
Charlie Rippon. Both are good run-
ners, mediocre passers.

How School
Got Religion

By Guy Unangst

The University of Miami, this past
June, lost nine students to its honor
code. Six were football players,
and coach Charlie Tate said their
loss weakened the team by 20 per
cent.

Which brings to mind a similar in-
cident at W&L a little more than 10
years ago.

In July of 1954, after complaining
of financial difficulties and academic
misfits due to subsidized football, and
mumbling for several years about
gradual de-emphasis, the Board of
Trustees suddenly decided to aban-
don the fall’s schedule. The reason,
buried beneath official rationaliza-
tion, was that 15 men, more than
half athletes, had been caught col-
lectively cheating.

STUDENT BODY president Wil-
liam Bailey called them a “syndi-
cate.”

The group had keys that would
open nearly every door on campus.
With the help of a janitor, they
had obtained advance copies of
quizzes, or substituted an improved
set of answers for those they had
written during a quiz period.

‘Contact’ Slated For
Mid-March Meeting

A mid-March weekend has been| sity of Mississippi is currently the

chosen for Contact according to
Blaine Brownell, chairman of the
steering committee for the weekend.
The dates selected were Marsh 12,
13, and 14.

The projected weekend will be an
intellectual symposium of the fac-
ulty and students of Washington and
Lee, presented under the auspices
of the Interfraternity Council.

The Theme for the weekend, as
was announced last spring, will be
The American Experience, and Its
Implications for the Individual Cit-
izen, the American Nation, and the
World. Approaches to the theme will
me made through a series of lec-
tures, seminars and discussions led
by guest speakers from government,
universities, churches, and founda-
tions.

Purpose

The Purpose of Contact, is to cre-
ate a more meaningful and more
highly significant expression of some
o fthe major ideas and issues that
confront our age.

Plans for the weekend are cur-
rently made by the student steering
committee in conjunction with five
national advisors and the three fac-
ulty advisors for the program.

National Advisers

Heading the list of national ad-
visors is Dean Acheson, Secretary
of State from 1949 to 1953. Serving
with him are Col. Francis P. Mil-
ler, Philander P. Claxton, Jr., Dr.
Marshall Fishwick, and Dr. James
W. Silver.

Dean Acheson, one of the coun-
try’s foremost experts on foreign
policy, is generally regarded as one
of the outstanding statesmen this
country has produced in the twen-
tieth century. He attended Yale
University and Harvard Law School
and has had a distinguished career
in law and government service. He
continues in both spheres through
a private practice of law in Wash-
ington and as head o fthe advisory
group o fthe North Atlantic Treaty
organization.

Col. Francis P. Miller

Col. Francis P. Miller, currently
a Foreign Affairs Officer in the De-
partment of Cultural and Educa-
tional Affiairs in the Department of
State, graduated from Washington
and Lee in 1924 and has had a dis-
tinguished career with the army
and the Council of Foreign Rela-
tions.

Philander P. Clavxton, Jr., has al-
o had a long and distinguished
career in the State Department,

graduating from the University of
Tennessee in 1934. He received his
M.A. degree from Princeton and his
LL.D. degree from Yale. He has

Endorse Ticket ©

The Johnson-Humphrey ticket re-

ceived an overwhelming endioree~|
ment from the Washington and Lee |
Young Democrats at the organiza-|

tion’s first meeting last week.

There was only one dissenting vote
as the W&L Young Democrats gave
a vote of confidence to the entire
Democratic ticket, including John-
son, Humphrey, and Virginia candi-
dites Harry Flood Byrd and Rep-

resentative Jack Marsh from this
District.
A compezign committee to push

the Johnson candidecy was appoint-
ed under the leadership of sopho-
msre Dave Mayfield. Bruce Me-
Ke'then, a Kappa Sig, was eppoint-
ed chairman of a committe to push a
mem ership drive. McKeithen re-
quesied that students interested in
jeining the club and working for
the Johnson ticket contact him at the |
Kappa Sig house. Freshmen are
asked to contact Steve Smith, Young
Democrat President, in room 489 of
the old Freshman Dormitory.

The Young Democrats are a
younger organization on campus
tha neither the Young Republicans
or the Conservative Society. Com-
pared to the Young Republicans,
they also are small and compara-
tively quiet. This fact indicates that
so far, Washington and Lee students |
lean heavily toward Goldwater's!
conservative philosophy. The W&L
Democrats face also the obstacle of

organization, since Senator Byrd has
not to date endorsed the Johnson
candidacy.

Steve Smith stated that the Dem-
ocrats’ next meeting, to be held!
after further campaign plans are
formulated and materials arrive!
from Washington, will be announced
on the ODK board.

The rise of James Brown and his
group has indeed been phenominal.
Srown was born and raised in Ma
con, Ga. As a young man he tried
both boxing and professional base-
ball until a knee injury forced him
to give up sports. Brown still claims
that his agility at hopping around
| the stage is due to his boxing train-
ing. Soon he joined a Negro gospel
group, and became so well known
for his musical talents that he was
able to form his own band.

In 1956 Brown’s group cut its
first record, “Please, Please, Please.”
The Record was a smash in the

| Macon area and did manage to at-

tract the attention of Syd Nathan of
King Records. From that point on
the story of James Brown and the
Flames is one success after another.
“Hold My Baby’s Hand” and “Fine
Old Foxy Self” were two more of
Brown's earlier, raunchier hits.
During the early 60’s “Try Me” and
“Mashed Potatoes U.S.Afl” kept him
on the hit list. In 1963 he made his
famous first appearance at the Apol-
lo Theater in Harlem. This memor-
able performance has often been
compared to the Ray Charles Atlanta
concert. The show was recorded and
has been Brown's best selling album.

Backing up the lead singer will
be the famous Flames. This trio in-
cludes Lloyd Stallworth, Bobby
Bennett, and Bobby Byrd. Byrd
holds the distinction of being the
only original Flame “still burning.”

There are a number of sidelights
to Brown's group that may be on
hand for the concert. Among the
more well know are T.V. Mama and
“gorgeous Tammy Montgomery.”

All these attractions and others
besides should make the Saturday
night concert at Openings a con-
cert that will be talked about for
a long time. Members of the dance
board remind students that dance
| plans are still available.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Tuesday Edition
Endorses Johnson

When the Washington and Lee Mock
Convention nominated Barry M. Goldwater
as its predicted Republican presidential nomi-
nee, the possibility of Goldwater’s eventually
winning the GOP nomination seemed remote
to the “experts.” In fact, the Washington and
Lee choice was so much scorned by the news
media that it was difficult to get publicity about
the nomination. That was on May 5; the an-
alysts were predicting that Goldwater would
lose the crucial California primary, and that
a moderate candidate would bear the Repub-
lican standard. Then came the Goldwater
miracle in California, and with that one pri-
mary, the nomination of the Republican Party
belonged to the man they had said couldn’t
couldn’t win it. Washington and Lee’s Mock
Convention was confirmed—the others proved
wrong—but at what cost?

What cost might it be to the United States
that the Republican Party is now under the
leadership of a man who day after day, while
campaigning for the White House, demon-
strates a lack of any basic understanding of
the realities of governing a nation and of in-
ternational politics? The Tuesday edition be-
lieves that the cost is no less than the possibil-
ity of destruction by nuclear warfare; that
Barry Goldwater casts the terrifying shadow
of nuclear war—that is, total annihilation.
This is why Senator Goldwater must be de-
feated, and by a decisive vote. This is why the
people of the United States must elect Lyndon
B. Johnson, a man who has proved himself
a great leader not only in many years of leg-
islative service, but also in a brilliant ten
months of achievement as President.

The Basis of Decision

The choice in foreign policy between
Johnson and Goldwater is a clear one, and it
is on this choice that the Tuesday edition
urges the defeat of Senator Goldwater. Inter-
national statesmanship must now rank as the
principal issue in any national election, be-
cause one serious mistake in foreign relations
could well relieve the nation of the necessity
of any domestic policy whatever. The choice
between Johnson and Goldwater is the choice
between a steady defense of United States
interests while working toward a gradual ac-
ceptance of co-existence (the original Ken-
nedy strategy) ; and on the other hand, Gold-
water’s policy of aggressive commitment to
“the reduction of Communist power to a level
from which it cannot threaten the security of
our nation or the peace of the world.” Gold-
water’s dreamy ideas of defeating the Com-

“In Your Heart You Know He’s Right”

Goldwater Wants Strength To Insure Peace

munists force us to the conclusion that a vote
for Johnson is the only reasonable alternative;
it is simply absurd to think that one nuclear
power can reduce another to impotence. This
is not “peace through strength,” as the Sena-
tor puts it—it is an invitation to self-annihila-
tion through thick-headedness.

A Lack of Grasp

Senator Goldwater’s failures in foreign
policy thinking seem to stem from a miscon-
ception of the world of today—a world in
which either of the two powers which domi-
nate the world, could and would destroy the
other if it believed its vital interests to be at
stake. In the atomic age, the power struggle
is at a kind of stalemate, since neither power
can consider war as a rational possibility; each
side must respect the other’s capability of de-
stroying the world. The reasonable solution
to tension and to the possibility of nuclear
warfare, is tolerance, negotiation, and the rec-
ognition of at least the bare facts of mutual
interest. This does not mean that the United
States can tolerate Communist encroachment
on its interest—but it does mean that this
country cannot make the mistake of pretend-
ing that only American ideals are fit to sur-
vive, and that we therefore must commit our-
selves to destroying the Soviet system. And
yet this is precisely the Goldwater philoso-
phy—either “we win” or “they win.” To
Goldwater there are only these two alterna-
tives. He does not see that either of these al-
ternatives would mean nuclear warfare; that
his position is precisely the one which will
ensure that neither nation can survive, much
less “win.” The Senator doesn’t realize that
sometimes even the United States must be will-
ing to be patient, to listen to people the world
over, to tolerate the ideals of other people—
no matter how repugnant those ideals may
be to Americans. In contrast to Goldwater’s
naive dreams of victory over the Commun-
ists, the Democrats present an administration
which perhaps has made mistakes on occasion,
but one which has approached each dilemma
with a sense of responsibility and an awareness
that the United States must be strong enough
to preserve world peace, yet wise enough to
restrain its strength for the same purpose,

at times.
Leadership In Diplomacy
A lack of grasp of the Cold War is not
Senator Goldwater's only failure as a leader
in foreign policy. Perhaps even more import-
ant are the Senator’s shortcomings in the abili-
ties of diplomacy. No man can with reason

impugn Goldwater’s honesty, his courage, and
his sincerity in fighting for his ideals. In fact,
for most, Goldwater’s open and likeable char-
acter contrast somewhat favorably with the
politician’s makeup which is evident in John-
son’s public personality. Yet unfortunately, by
the same token that he is frank enough to
say what he thinks and mean it, Goldwater is
reckless enough to act without reflecting on
what he is doing. In international relations
there is no longer time for second thoughts,
for modification in careless statements. And
Senator Goldwater has shown a dangerous re-
liance on second thoughts and belated expla-
nations—even during the present campaign.
This potentiality for careless action is the one,
perhaps the only characteristic which a head
of the state absolutely must not possess today.
It is one of which President Johnson cannot
be accused. Lyndon Johnson has earned only
respect as a leader able to uphold the interests
of the free world and at the same time to main-
tain the fine balance of international relations
which is so ready to teeter, to plunge into the
abyss of war. President Johnson has already
proved his abilities in a serious crisis—but
Barry Goldwater has shown himself unfit to
be entrusted with such responsibility.
An Unrealistic Attitude

To be specific in the condemnation of
Goldwater’s foreign policy positions, his ex-
pression very recently that it makes no dif-
ference who wins the Sino-Soviet conflict
illustrates the most dangerous ignorance of
the simple principles of realistic politics. Gold-
water shows himself unwilling to exploit op-
portunity, unable to recognize a possible ally,
unable to weaken an enemy by diplomatic
moves—in sum the Senator shows us an as-
tonishing vacancy in the realm of political
realism. His inability to deal with peoples who
reject Americanism is an inability to realize
the fact that among countries which are unlike
the United States, there can be both friends
and enemies. Goldwater has a boyish faith in
the American system which borders on chau-
vinism and smacks of intolerance. His combi-
nation of idealism and intolerance is his rea-
son for a long history of voting against foreign
aid, which he denounces variously as “ill-con-
ceived” or “global welfarism.”

It is an attitude which leads Goldwater to
speak favorably of the withdrawal of diplo-
matic recognition from the Soviet Union. The
Senator advocates that the United States gov-
ernment announce that it “does not regard

Mr. Khrushchev’s murderous clique as the

W&L Mock Convention Was Right--Too Right

legitimate ruler of the Russian people or of
any other people.” To put Goldwater in the
White House—to give him the power of mak-
ing such a colossal mistake—might put a
deadly strain on the balance of world peace.
It might also put a serious strain on the mem-
bers of the free world; and it would deeply
alienate many neutral nations.

“Marines and Brinkmanship”

But the Senator plunges ahead, speaking
now of liberating Eastern Europe, now of
winning the war with North Viet Nam. His
recommendation that the President send the
marines into Cuba is nothing unusual for
Goldwater. His plans for victory are as anti-
quated as they are wild. He often refers to
the policies of John Foster Dulles as a model,
and intimates that he might attempt to em-
ploy “‘brinkmanship” as an ultimatum to the
Communists. He might attempt to enforce
peace by threatening war. This is a method
which in the hands of an impulsive man such
as Senator Goldwater, might very well lead
us to war; and war between nuclear powers
is not a rational consideration. Even if initial
conflicts are not fought with nuclear weapons,
the danger of escalation stands at the elbow
of such “conventional” warfare. A demand
for victory over an opponent which possesses
nuclear weapons and a delivery system, is
nothing else but a demand for self-annihila-
tion. And in the end, this is the possible cost
to Americans for voting for Barry Goldwater
for president.

At the moment, President Johnson seems
assured of victory over the Senator from
Arizona. However, this is not the first time
Senator Goldwater has been counted out by
the pollsters and the experts. Not long ago
he was considered a “fringe” representative
who could not possibly win the Republican
nomination. This attitude produced a certain
complacency in the hearts of moderate Repub-
licans—who shortly suffered a very rude
awakening. The next five weeks must not see
the Democratic Party caught napping at the
switch; in the face of Senator Goldwater's
frenzied backing there must be no complac-
ency. Now, if ever, is the time for the Amer-
ican democracy to prove to itself and to the
world, that it will accept only responsible
leadership. Lyndon Johnson must be given
an overwhelming vote of confidence; and
equally important, Barry Goldwater must be
beaten so badly that he and his followers
will be unable to return for a repeat perfor-
mance in 1968. America has no other choice.

By BILL BURKE

Senator Goldwater's foreign policy
is PEACE, PEACE through strength.
The best way to AVOID war is to
remain strong. Since 1961 not a single
new weapons system has been inau-
gurated. Senator Goldwater has
stated, “if we follow the phased
weakness of the present administra-
tion, I very much fear that we may

Administration is doing now! Ap-
peasement has led us to war before,
will it again? This is not to say
Senator Goldwater wants to pre-
pare for war—but rather so we will
not have to appease the aggressors
and we can avoid war.

Results of a Weak Foreign Policy

been listened to, there is every rea-
son to believe World War II could
have been prevented. Only through
strength can we keep peace. Is it
strength that was responsible for the
enemy attacks at the Gulf of Tonkin
and around the world? Or was it the
enemies’ doubt of our strength—and
our will to use it?

If Senator Goldwater is elected
President he will say to Khrushchev,
as he has in the past, “you are
wrong.” Our grandchildren will not
live under communism, but rather
your grandchildren will live under
freedom. He will say, “Why not
victory?” For a victory may be
won by maintaining our strength
and advocating the ideals of free-
dom. This means, “The right of
freedom instead of slavery; it means
the right of every man to worship
God; of nations to determine their
own destiny free of force and coer-
cion. It means human dignity and
freedom of choice. And it means
peace with honor.”

In your heart you know he's right.

Prig a Kappa Sig told Sclater a Beta,
then Cy, a Lambda Chi, told me, an
SAE; and I'll tell you because
it's true; and then, I don't have any-
thing else to do.

After the last Sunday rush date,
when all the freshmen, or at least
most of them, had returned to the
dorms and were discussing the mer-
its and drawbacks of the various fra-

ternities, a well-dressed Undergrad- |

uate with a name tag on his tle
marked, “The Man With the Blue
Guitar” (No fraternity, no home
given) strolled into the Quad (inci-
dently, this was against IFC rules),
gave a loud Struuuucooommmm! on
his blue guitar, then sat down right
in the middle of the brick floor.
Soon all the freshmen were hanging
out the windows, or had come down
and were sitting in a circle around
the young man who had begun to
play a melody on his blue guitar

They said, “You have a blue guitar,

 

You do not play things as they are.”

To his breath that lies awake at
night,

I know that timid breathing. Where

The Generals’ initial drive came as halfback and co-captain
Bill David took the game’s first punt and ran it back 55 yards to

the Randolph-Macon 43-yard line*
Several plays later, however, as| |
W&L threatened, the Jackets’

on the five-yard line.

Later in the same period W&L
sustained a drive that led to the R-M
eight-yard line where a General

fumble cost them another scoring |

opportunity. The third Washington

Larry Craig coupled with David for
two long passes that ate up 53 yards
to the home team’s three-yard line.
After three unsuccessful
from the three, fullback John An-

thony had trouble handling a direct |]

pass from center on a attempted

endsrun and had to fall on the ball nm

at the Jacket five.

Although the Generals came out
on the short end of the score, the
game statistics showed that W&l
gained 67 more yards in total of-
fense and ran up four more first
downs than did the Jackets.

string right end forced General
Coach Lee McLaughlin to use a
sophomore at this position. Ran-

their scoring drive.

Other than Barclay, who may be
able to compete next Saturday, and
center Jeff Novinger, who sat out the

Kirkpatrick, Henry Score Goals;
Coach Lyles Praises Team Unity

By BOB CARTER
Tuesday Sports Writer

Washington and Lee opened its 1964 soccer at home with
a fine 2-1 victory over Pfeiffer College. W&L failed to score
until the third quarter when left inside Dave Kirkpatrick headed
the ball for a score after Tim Henry had booted a penalty
kick called on the Pfeiffer goalie for taking more than four
steps. The second W&L goal was scored by center forward

*Tim Henry on a screen shot in the
fourth period.

Pfeiffer’s only goal came in the
fourth period when center forward
David Smith scored on a short pass
when W&L goalie Bob Larus was
out of position.

Coach Lyles had high praise for
backs Howard Busse, David Red-
mond, and Pete Preston for
the fine defensive game they played.
Wes Horner and Dave Kirkpatrick
| led the line play. Coach Lyles com-
mented, “The passing of Pfeiffer was
good but W&L had better shots. The
Generals better condition and team
unity were decisive factors in the
victory.”

Lack of Depth

No starters return from last year’s
team. Although the first team is
good, the team’s biggest problem
seems to be a lack of depth. Coach
Lyles is helping solve the problem
by using several players from the
freshman team. Slated to see a lot of
action is foreigner John Van Bork
from Amsterdam, Netherlands who
is a freshman this year.

 

 

 

 

The biggest and most important
game of the season is Tuesday,
Sept. 29 against Lynchburg College

on the home field. The outcome of
this game will prove to be an indi-
cation of the rest of the season.

WHY
WE
CARRY
GANT

There's more than fabric superiority in Gant. In addi-
tion, ‘‘needied-into the warp and woof of every Gant
shirt" — there's flair-fit show — three vital inher-
ents that make all the difference when a man wears
a Gant,

We chose Gant because they take shirt making serl-
ously. They're hard to please (like we are) when it
comes to fit of collar, its roll, its profile—how much
it shows above the suit collar, They're fastidious
about the way the body of the shirt drapes and folds.
All must integrate to achieve that viable ingredient
which gives comfort and aplomb. In substance, Gant
shirts are keyed to the discerning tastes of well
groomed men who appreciate quality. These men are
our customers.

Old Reid Hall
Is Remodeled

For Journalism

The remodelling of Reid Hall,
which seniors remember as the old
Physics building, has been complet-
ed. Renovation o fthe building that
now houses the journalism depart-
ment began in October of 1963. The?
project was financed primarily by
alumni donations, no costs figures|
have been released.

 

The three story building provides!
space and modern facilities for all
the journalism department’s activi-)
ties. The second floor serves as the
center of instruction with a large,
one hundred seat auditorium; a
seminar room; student lounge; and
a library.

The first and third floors house |
the facilities which enable students |
to gain proficiency in journalism and
communications. These are a pho-
tography lab, a print shop, three
broadcasting room and a _ control
room, a mail room newspaper of-
fice and an advertising lab.

The new facilities for journalism
have provided the History and Eng-
lish departments with badly needed
elbow room. The History department
has taken over the old print shop,
placing three of its offices and a
classroom there, and the English de-/|
partment has moved into the first
floor of Payne Hall.

Letters To The Editor

For years student government at
Washington and Lee has been con-
trolled by various selfish factions.
At the end of last year ten frater-
nities combined to form the Liberal

Party. These ten fraternities asso-|———~

ciated together for the sole pur-
pose of gaining the prestige of hav-
ing one of their own brothers put
into office. The Executive Committee
appoints other committees, and thus
EC snowballs into
mountains of prestige for all the fra-
ternities belonging to the party in
control.

Another party, the Progressive
Party, is smaller but still has the
same selfish motives. At last report
this party was controlled by five

| fraternities.

The time has come for the fresh-
man class to abandon the corruption
of these big political machines. Self-
ish motives have no place on the
E.C. I urge all freshmen, fraternity
members and non-fraternity mem-
bers alike, to abandon this “time-
honored tradition.” It is a disgrace to
the integrity of the Washington and
Lee student body, and will remain
so as long as we allow it.

Let’s prevent the important posi-
tions of the Executive Committee
from being made into footballs of
prestige for these various selfish
factions. I urge you, the class of
1968. to vote for the independent

Rush Report

Editor’s note: The following is
the official report on the 1964 rush
week by Interfraternity Council
Rush Chairman Mike McCord. It
was written with the assistance of
the individual fraternity rush

By MIKE McCORD
IFC Rush Chairman

Aside from minor problems, such
as a rushee signing up for two open
house dates or a fraternity failing |
to pick up a rushee, the IFC feels
that the new rush system went
smoothly. Nevertheless, there are a
few more major problems which
need to be ironed out.

One major problem which could
have developed was fortunately
avoided. It came about when a
rushee signed up for a rush date |
when he was supposed to be signing ©
up for an open house only. When
the matter was taken up by the
Judicial Board it was found such |
practice had not been

le

covered by |
the constitution, and they were able
to fill the gap before such procedure |

became common practice.
'

 

Problems, Problems

Another problem that arose, how-
ever, will not be solved so easily.
This is that the fraternities which
have the better-known national |
names obtained a far greater per-
centage of rushee at the open house
dates. This was especially true on
Thursday. To prevent this it has

Sazeracs Plan ’64 Calendar
Eight New Members Added

The Sazeracs, Washington and
Lee's nationally famous singing
group, has launched what is expect-
ed to be their finest season. The
group, which has cut a record and
made numerous appearances on the
east coast, this week added eight
new members and a new repertoire.

“We're making plans to do more
things this season and do them in a
new, and we hope, better manner,”
said Chuck Griffin, president of the
student organization.

Among the eight new members
are first tenor, John Ballentine;
second tenors, Roger Blair and
Warren Stewart; baritones, Mike
McCord, Al Byrne, and Roger:
Brown; and basses, Bob Lohman
and Harold Hobart.

Time Problem

The strict time limits for the open
houses presented quite a problem
during the first day. A number of
fines were levied, however, and the
problem seemed to work itself out.
This does not mean, however, that
some minor changes are not in order.
Perhaps a fifteen minute interval
might be more satisfactory for the
fraternities and the rushee.

On the brighter side, the whole
rush week went very well from the
IFC’s viewpoint. There were no
major infractions of the rushing
rules, the rushees were enthusiastic,
and the fraternities got their pledges.
It is hoped that the system can be
improved in the years to come, but
without the continued cooperation
of the fraternities such improve-
ment will not be possible. The IFC,
therefore, urges both the freshmen| There is room for all eight new
and the fraternities to suggest ways| members, but it will be necessary to

Therefore, all must go through a five
week probation period before a
final decision can be made.

“They're all fine singers,” ex-
plained Griffin, “however, if some-
one can’t blend with the group then
our whole effect could be ruined.
This is the reason for the probation
period.”

The nucleus of the group consists
of its seven returning members.
They are first tenor, Scott Darrah;
second tenors, Bud Goodheart,
Pete Hendricks, and Marke Gee;
baritone Rob Vaughn; and basses
Chuck Griffin and Dave Streetman.

“Our itenary for this season is
really shaping up,” said Rob Vaughn,
business manager.

Concerts have been scheduled at
all five neighboring girls’ schools, an
appearance in Richmond, and the
group's annual trip to Taboo
Club in Palm Beach, Fiorida.

The Sazeracs first appearance
en the Washington and Lee cam-
pus will be on Parents’ Weekend.

“We really enjoy performing for
the parents,” said Griffin. “By that
time we hope to have the new rep-
ertoire down and all fifteen voices
blending well.”

Griffin stated that once the new
group reaches the point that they
blend well together and once the
new repertoire is mastered, then
the Sazeracs will cut their second
album.

“Sales from the first album were
very good and we'd like to try it
again,” noted Griffin. “If everyiaing
goes well, we might be able to
record again this fall.”

Jim Kulp Selects
EC Committee
For Who’s Who

(In order to dismantle the shroud
of mystery which has seemed to sur-
round the EC, the Friday Ring-tum
Phi will be represented at all the
meetings of the Executive Commt-
tee to report the actions taken by
the student government.)

At the EC Tuesday night meet-
ing, President Jim Kulp appointed
a committee to make recommenda-
tions to the EC for Who's Who.
The committee is composed of Jim
DeYoung, Chairman, Bob Pless,
Rick Carrell, Dave Geer, and Chuck
Walker.

A motion was passed authorizing
that $1,000 from the Publications
Board Reserve Fund be spent to set
up a darkroom for the campus pub-
lieations.

A letter from the National Col-
legiate Magazine urging the student
government to support subscriptions,
as well as to contribute a short col-
umn was discussed. The suggestion
was made that the letter be given
to the Student War Memoria! Schol-
arship Fund Committee.

Brooks Brown, Chairman of the
Assimilation Committee, discussed
with members of the Executive-
mittee the policy that his commit-
tee will follow during the next
year. It was emphasized that the
spirit of conventional dress, rather

than a definite code of appropriate |

clothing, be stressed. Active sup-
port from all campus groups will
be solicited in this effort.

can claim as many hit records, or as
long a period of success as these
four singers.

Shirelles’ Success Story
The Shirelles originally came from'
Passaic, New Jersey, where they.
were discovered by the president of
Scepter Records who heard them)
sing in a high school show. Their)
first recording, “I Met Him on a
Sunday,” became one of the biggest
hits in the country, and earned them
a long term contract with Scepter
Records. At present the Shirelles are
still recording for Secpter Records.
The Shirelles continued their suc-
cess with the subsequent recording
of “Dedicated to the One I Love.”
This song has now become somewhat
of a standard with lovers of popu-
lar music. Other hit recordings of
the Shirelles include “Tonight's the
Night,” “Will You Love Me Tomor-
row,” “Mama Said,” “What a Sweet
Thing That Was,” “I Don't Want to
Cry,” “Baby It's You,” “Big John,”
“Soldier Boy,” “A Thing of the
Past,” and many others.

 

 

Unique Singing Style

Many people attribute the suc-
cess of the Shirelles to their unique
singing style and sound. lt is pos-
sible for any one of the group to
sing lead, without the group loosing
its distinctive style.

Dance Board Announces
First Informal Dance Set

MILLER

Assistant Editor
The University Dance Board has announced that the inter-
nationally famous Shirelles will be the featured attaraction
of this year’s Opening Dance. Featured with the Shirelles will

from New York.

The appearance of the Shirelles on Friday night, October
16, will be their second appearance in the

past three years at

 

country as part of a road company
of rock and roll stars. Their recep-
tion was tremendous , and was

matehed by audiences during their
tours of Australia, England and
Frence.

In 1962 the Shirelles joined with
King Curtis, lesder of his own nae
tionally fomous band, to tour the
country in personal appearances and
3 t Tais uniting of two great
nome dded tremendously to the

both ec2reers. This combi-
nation, however, did not last, as it

 

  
 

broke up shortly efter its eppearznce
at W&L in 1°62. A permanent record
9f this unique combination is pre-

red in their hit album, “The
Shirelles

and King Curtis Give a
Twist Party.”

Six recent Hit Albums

More recently the Shirelles have
continued to record nothing but hit
songs. In addition to their impres-
sive lists of hit songs, the Shirelles
have recorded over six albums, all
hits.

Steve Hibbard, President of the
University Dance Board has an-
nounced that Dance Plans are still
available. They may be purchased
at the Co-op as late as October 15 for
the price of thirty dollars. This rep-
resents a savings of at least fifty per
cent from the cost of attending each
individual concert and dance.

 

Telephone Frauds
Becoming Serious

Several recent laws concerning
telephone long distance have result-
ed in arrest and jail sentences of
students who apparently are not
aware of the seriousness of such a
matter. Fines of $500.00 and jail
sentences of 6 months can result
from toll misuse.

Recently three Cornell University
students received fines and jail sen-
tences for attempts to defraud. Even
closer to home, a University of Vir-
ginia student was fined $100.00 and
sentenced to 90 days in jail for giv-
ing a wrong number on $18.00 worth
of toll.

The new laws involve the use of
wrong numbers or telephone credit
ecards to pay for long distance calls.
Also covered under the new pro-
vison is the illegal use of any type
recording to simulate bell tones on
pay telephones.

The new laws would also fall un-
der the Washington and Lee honor
system which could mean removal
from the University as well as the
removal from the University as
well as the fine or jail sentence re-
ceived

Editorial Policy

The foremost consideration in the determination of the
Friday Ring-tum Phi editorial policy will be what it considers
to be in the interest of the well-being of Washington and Lee
University.

 

While we recognize the importance of the concensus of
opinion, we do not concede its eternal validity; therefore, our
editorial position will never be assumed in order to express
the wishes of a majority of students or faculty, merely because
they are in the majority.

Editorials will express the opinions of the editorial board
of the newspaper. Second page bylined columns express the
opinion of their authors; they are not necessarily the opinions
of the newspaper, but serve to provide a forum for student
expression.

Letters to the Editor are encouraged and serve as another
means of student expression. All letters received will be pub-
lished, except those in poor taste or of extreme length.

While acting as a student forum the staff will try to remain
as fair as possible, prescribing to the codes of good newspaper
journalism.

It is through these standards that we, the Friday Edition
of the Ring-tum Phi, hope to serve the student body and ad-
ministration of Washington and Lee. Your comments and
interest will be appreciated.

The Dodo—Gone Forever

In the third issue of last year’s Ring-tum Phi, the following
editorial opinion was expressed:

 

“At the outset of every school year there appears
at Washington and Lee a last vestige of the days when
freshman hazing was sanctioned by the university and
by the student body. This last evidence that freshmen
are not really full human beings, this holdout of the
collegiate dark ages, is, of course, the ludicrous
“beanie.” It is truly farcical that the W&L student gov-
ernment expends effort to enforce conformity to the
wearing of this asinine skullcap ... .

Fortunately, for the whole of W&L as well as for
the freshman class, the beanie has disappeared from the
campus vogue; it has been buried like the dodo or the dinosaur,
hopefully, never to return.

The purpose of the beanie was, it seems, aside from intro-
ducing upperclassmen and Lexington merchants to new stu-
dents, supposed to instill a sense of pride in the indivdual. That
it did this is somewhat doubtful. Instead, it made the fresh-
man a marked man, setting him disgracefully apart from the
rest of the community.

A former chairman of the Assimilation Committee stated
in his R-t P column that “The traditions to which the student
body subscribes are constant values in an age in which the
very meaningless relative value too often is the standard against
which we judge our actions.”

We of the Friday Ring-tum Phi submit that not only was
the beanie a very meaningless tradition, but also that it was a
detriment in the assimilation of new students. On the other
hand, we believe that the name tags do have meaning in the
assimilation of freshmen. Not only are they more individualistic
in nature, they are also much more characteristic of a gentle-
men. It goes without saying that they better fulfill the pur-
pose for which they were intended—the incorporation of new
students into W&L life.

We applaud the Assimilation Committee and the Execu-
tive Committee for ridding us of this valueless dodo.

Of course—

Nothing can express the deep grief we feel at having
such a time-honored tradition untimely ripped from the Wash-
ington and Lee scene.

Nothing can replace the beanie.
Thank Goodness!

 

Sincere Appreciation

If you observed an article in the lower left hand corner
on the front page of last Tuesday’s Ring-tum Phi with the head
“James Ambler Endowment Fund To Increase Faculty Sal-
aries” at all, you probably didn’t read it. To some it seems in-
consequential that a W&L alumnus granted this University
$100,000 in order to increase faculty salaries,

However, it is not frequently that such a generous
endowment is made to W&L. If so, it seems that com-
mon gratitude dictates that we express ourselves more
obviously than to hope that Mr. Ambler will infer the
appreciation that we feel.

The fact is that Mr. James C. Ambler of New York and
Montclair, New Jersey, who is Chairman of the Board of
Trustees of Ginn & Company, has granted Washington and
Lee $100,000 to support the James C. Ambler and James C.
Ambler, Jr., Endowment Fund.

Both Mr. Ambler and his son are alumni of this University
classes of 1918 and 1958.

Certainly we do feel gratitude that someone as distinguish-
ed as the Chairman of the Board of Ginn & Company has seen
fit to make such a generous grant to the University.

We do sincerely thank you, sir.

  

 

Is It Because We Didn’t Know?

 

Marshall Library Not Part of VMI

By KEN McGRAW

Since the completion of the George
C. Marshall Research Library last
spring, it has drawn very little stu-
dent attention. This seems to be true,
because we have the idea that the
library is part of VMI. I know that
this was the case for myself, and

I suspect that it is for many others
as well. This idea, however, is a
gross misconception as are a number
of others commonly held by students
concerning this library.

First, the library itself belongs to
the Marshall Foundation. It was

Hazing—A Thing Of The Past
“If You're Smart,” Freshman

By TRACY HARRINGTON '

Freshmen are settling down, now,
to the changless routine of Wash-|
ington and Lee life.

Those who are fraternity pledges |

will soon begin to realize that peo-
i Ple mean by “ral-

| lies,” “line-ups,”

and “fun and
games.” That is,
they'll fall into
the same old bout)
with the barf)
cocktail — unless |
they’re smart.

If they're smart, |
they'll tell the!
fraternities to take |
it in the appropri-
ate aperture—and
refuse to subject themselves to a
lot of senseless push-ups, duck
walks and infantile activities de-
signed to satisfy the sub-human
humor of sophomoric upperclassmen.

If they're really smart, the fresh-
men will wake up to the fact that
not a single fraternity can do
without a pledge class; that all
they have to do is say “no,” and
the houses’ hands are tied: that
threatened walk-out by a pledge
class would seare any fraternity
into rescinding a ridiculous tra-
dition; that the only way hazing
is ever going to end is by just
such radical action on the part of
freshmen.

 

carriugton

If they're smart they will agree
to do constructive labors, as a part
o fthe pledging period; they will be
skeptical of all the arguments used
to justify hazing, to wit: it united
a pledge class, it makes you appre-
ciate the fraternity more, it's a
tradition; they'll find a few honest
upperclassmen who'll admit that)
none of this is true, that the only!
purpose hazing serves is whetting a}
few sadistic appetites; they'll realize |
that nobody is “shaped up” by it,|

i

nobody profits from it |

 

If they're smart, they'll organize; |

they'll get together and work out
a plan of dealing with the houses:

they'll stick together and accom- |

plish one of the most needed
changes at Washington and Lee:

they'll come to this columnist, and |

a few other upperclassmen he can
name, and find out where to hit
the fraternities in their most vul-
nerable spots.

All this they'll do, if they're smart,
smarter than any freshman class so
far has been. But that’s pretty
doubtful.

Rider Proposes
Letter Solution

By BRUCE RIDER

Of all the banes of existence of
the modern college student, Writing
Home is about the baniest.

Yes, you are taking your vitamins.
Yes, you will look up Fred's neph-
ew over at VMI, but you just can’t
be expected to dash off a letter home
every month.

A college man’s time, as we all
know, is extremely valuable, and it
must be used wisely.

Therefore, it is necessary for you
to figure out some practical and ef-
fective school-to-home communica-
tions system whereby you will both
sooth the parents’ fears and free
your time for greater and grandier
things.

Here are a few suggestions, then,
concerning the means of solving the
problem of writing hime.

(1) Seratch out your name on
the envelope and write “Return to
Sender” on all letters from home. If
they recognize your handwriting
they will know that you are at least
safe, and most probably sound. Even
a brief “hi there” or “things are
swell at W&L” or I'm really enjoying
P.E. 1” scrawled on the back of the
envelope will be warmly received on
the home front.

(2) Or, you can get together with
nine or ten other students and or-
ganize a Letter of the Month Club
Each month one member of the
| Club will write a form letter for the
| whole bunch to send to their respec-

 

| tives homes. Thus you will only have
| to write one letter home per college
| year, or, if you are a long range
| planner only four letters per college
ieareer. Of, if you really don't want
| to go back home, and you go to law
| school instead, you need only to
| write a total of seven letters

puses of W&L and VMI, at General
Marshall’s suggestion through pri-
vate funds. The only official connec-
tion which these two schools have
is that their heads, Dr. Cole and
Major General Shell, are ex-officio
members to the Board of Directors.

Marshall’s Life

Another reason for the lack of
student interest may stem from the
fact that many of us do not realize
the importance of this project. A
short presentation of facts and fig-
ures should clear this up. Beginning
with Gen. .Marshall’s life, it is no
empty statement to call him one of
the most important men of the 20th
century. Between 1901 and 1945, he
occupied every commissioned rank
in the United States Army. He held
decorations from sixteen countries
as well as more than a dozen decor-
ations and service medals from the
U.S. He had bestowed on him six-
teen major civilian awards, including
the Nobel Peace Prize; fifteen hon-
orary degrees from colleges and uni-
versities, and was U.S. representa-
tive to fifteen international assem-
blies. He was author of the Mar-
shall Plan and held the positions
of Chief of Staff, Secretary of De-
fense, and Secretary of State in our
government. It should humble us to
think that through the Marshall Li-
brary, which is no more than a three
minute walk from campus, that we
have the most complete insight into
his life available.

Foundation Heads

| To point out further the import-
; ance of this library, we can look at)
the men behind it. One is former!

 

 

President, Harry S. Truman, who
first suggested the Foundation in
1953. Another is Gen of the Army,
Omar N. .Bradley, the present Pres-
ident of the Foundation. Acting as
Director for the Research Library is
Dr. Forrest C. Pogue, a well-known
author and educator, and there are
many other impressive names that
could be mentioned. .

At present, only the exhibit rooms
of the library are open. Designed
by the Smithsonian Institution, the
displays are impressive and exciting,
and succeed in giving an insight
into Gen. Marshall’s life. The most
memorable part of the exhibit
though is the half hour show put
on by a 9x12 feet electric map. By
means of flashing lights and a tape
recording, the map tells the entire
story of World War II. It was built
at a cost of $25,000.

Outstanding Library

In two years time the building will
house a large collection of docu-
ments, books, and records, including
Gen. Marshall’s personal papers. The
process of collecting and cataloguing
these is going on now. When fin-
ished, the Marshall Library will be
the most complete library on 20th
century diplomatic and military his-
tory in the South. The entire build-
ing and organization is a monument
to the words of Winston Churchill
who said, “Succeeding generations
must not be allowed to forget his
achievements or his example.’ I
would hate to think that W&L stu-
dents could be so apathetic as not
to take both interest and pride in
this project.

 

Beatles Make
In ‘A Hard

By JAMES JENNINGS

It seems that every singer wants
to make movies and every movie
star wants to sing.
I suppose that if
a person can do
both he becomes
a true entertainer
in the tradition of
Frank Sinatra or
maybe Gary Cros-
by or Fabian. Pro-
ducers and script
writers have a
rough time taking
a teen-age idol
and putting him
on the screen in a work that justi-
fies serious consideration or even
notable mention.

The Beatles solve all the prob-
lems of plot, characterization, and
justification of production by simp-
ly being themselves in “A Hard
Day's Night.” We watched these
clowns prepare for a TV show in
a way that not too many perform-
ers prepare for anything. They go
through rehearsals, night clubs,
each other, press conferences,
everybody else, and finally appear
on the show with their usual
sympathetic detachment.

The strong point of the movie is
the personalities of the Beatles. They
are delightful with quick wits and
a large capacity for enjoying them-
selves. They seem to enjoy being
together, working together, and
most of all making millions together.

John Lennon's bathtub scene is
amusing, Paul's grandfather offers
diversity, George is just there, but
he has his moment in the field, and
Ringo, “the middle-aged young
man,” has a sequence that is remin-
iseent of Charlie Chaplin or perhaps
Buster Keaton. The pantomime in
the field has been compared to
those of the Keystone Cops. It is
a very enjoyable frolic that enters
the film abruptly and departs in the
same manner.

One of the more striking as-
pects of the staging is that we do
net have to watch the Beatles

Military Virtue

By RICK SIMON

The tedium of classes has already
begun to lay heavy on the mind that
yearns to be free, and on the body
that yearns for something better
than the discomfort of the seated
position associated with study. That
is, it becomes increasingly evident
that it is indeed possible to yearn
while you learn. As the back stiffens
and, once again, takes on the con-
tours of a ribbed-back library chair,
we savor the less pleasant aspects
of the seat of learning.

As we look forward upon the
coming semesters there is a glint in
the eye, a pounding of the heart,
a trembling sensation in the pit of
the stomach in the general vicinity
of the navel, and united we say—
“YECH!” But let us not be dis-
trought. For the Peace Corps we
need a degree but not for the army.

. + >

The girl who called the house and
invited us to the Sem mixer sounded
sincere, but I cannot be certain. The
Mink has again run a valiant second
to the Veemi. Seems as though our
military counterparts are intent upon
maintaining their six-mile extension
of power. The young ladies of “the
hill” are so found of the uniform-
the symbol of discipline, of restraint,
of mannered conduct, of quiet and
calculating strength. How can we,
the very antithesis of military vir-
tue, even conceive of excluding them
from our house parties?

enhanced the already questionable
beauty of Lexington. But, discount-

Like Randolph-Macon, Oberlin entertains Washington and

Lee’s football Generals after a season-opening loss.

The Yeomen fell last week

to Hiram, 23-6, a score which

is not as bad as it looks. The halftime score was 6-6 and last
year, when it was 6-2 for a second place tie in the 15-team

Ohio Conference, Oberlin
52-0.

Oberlin’s strongest point is its of-
fensive line, all seven members of
which returned from 1963’s first

string. It lists only guard Bert La-| Oberlin quarterback Dave Guerrera, |
' | injured last Saturday, would not be |

tran, a 210-pounder, as weighing
more than 200 pounds, but is noted
for minimizing its assets.

Dave Guerrera has switched from
defense to quarterback, where he
threatens a frequent roll-out option.
He threw 21 passes last week against
Hiram.

Power runner Bob Jenkins, a
halfback converted to fullback, does
most of the ball carrying. Last sea-
son he averaged 4.3 yards per carry.

The Yeomen run from an unbal-
anced line with split end Ed Siggers
being Guerrera’s favorite pass tar-
get.

Defensively, Oberlin lost several
starters, and freshmen must fill the
gaps.

Opens CAC

The five-member College Athlet-
ie Conference opens its third season
of football competition Saturday
when Centre and Southwestern meet
in Memphis.

Other members of the conference—
Sewanee, Washington University and
Washington and Lee—move into ac-
tion in weeks following, with most
league play falling in late October
and early November.

For the first time since the “ama-
teur” conference was established in
1962, each member will play all
four conference opponents.

Defending champion Sewanee
bumped four league foes enroute to
a perfect 8-0 season in 1963, includ-
ing a dramatic, last minute 14-13
victory over Washington in the sea-
son's final game.

Intramural Week

 

Flunk-Outs Ruled I neligible

By JOHN BEAGLE
Students who have fallen under
the automatic rule and been rein-

stated by the university are in-
eligible to compete in intramural
sports, athletic director E. P. “Cy”
Twombly ruled Wednesday.

In the special ruling, handed
down at the request of the intra-
mural board, Twombly said there
had never been a set policy on
the matter in the past. Any rein-
stated student is also ineligible for
intercollegiate athletics, he said

The intramural board, meeting
with Twombly, also voted to ex-
tend the time limit in football from
eight to ten minutes running time
per quarter. The fraternities had
requested the action

| Ohio, and a clash with the Yeomen
of Oberlin College.

Injured in last Saturday's 8-0
loss to Randolph-Macon were ends
Bob Barclay, Bob Stauffer and Phil
Thompson. Running back Mike
Goode has been slowed by the flu
and probably will not see action to-
morrow. Sophomore Rob Reading re-
places Barclay who will handle
only the punting duties.

Center Jeff Novinger, who sat out
last week’s game with an injured
hand, will be in the lineup for the
first time this season. Another
change moved in fullback Tommy
Sparks as first team defensive line-
backer.

Coach Lee McLaughlin cited four
players for outstanding play in the
season opener. The passing combi-
nation of Larry Craig-to-Bill David,
which connected six times for 107
yards received special recognition.
McLaughlin also praised guard Joe
Miller for his job at linebacker,
and tackle Jack Kelley for his of-
fensive play

MeLaughlin also praised the way
quarterback Bryant Kendrick moved
the second offensive unit. Co-captain
Tommy Crenshaw was the big
ground gainer from his right half-
back position

The Generals, normally a grind-
it-out team, picked up 130 yards
through the airways against the
Yellow Jackets, only eight less than
their rushing yardage. Finding the
defenses keyed to a ground game
was the factor that led to the suc-
eess of the passing attack. McLaugh-
lin indicated that passing might be
the key to defeating Oberlin

In spite of a host of game mis-

takes—busted signals and four non-
eontact fumbles—MecLaughlin said
that the team “showed some real

good football. We just barely missed
on some running plays and made

some defensive errors.”

Behind the defensive play of
goalie Bob Larus and its three full-
backs, Washington and Lee’s soc-
ser team defeated Lynchburg, 2-0,
here Tuesday.

Larus made 12 saves and full-
backs Pete Preston, Howard Busse
and Dave Redmond played all 88
minutes in shutting out Lynchburg,
which was runner-up to Virginia
in last year’s state tournament.

John Van Bork, a foreign ex-
change student from Amsterdam,
and Dave Kirkpatrick kicked the
goals. Van Bork scored in the sec-
ond quarter on an assist by Kirk-
patrick, who took Brad Shinkle’s
pass for a third period score.

Linked with last week’s win
against Pfeiffer, coach Joe Lyles
said the victory indicates a success-
ful season. “It was something more
than a regular game,” he said.

Lynchburg, which does not play
football, strongly supports its soc-
cer team. “They had more fans than
here than we did,” Lyles said.

Lyles has moved All-State cen-
ter forward Tim Henry to right
wing and All-State right halfback
Wes Horner to left wing in order
to open up the middle. Van Bork
and senior Steve Hibbard replace
them.

The first string is strongly vet-
eran—“It’s the best first team in
the history of W&L,” Lyles said—
but the second team is composed
entirely of freshmen and sopho-
mores.

Today his team played at Ran-
dolph-Macon. The Generals won
last year, 6-1.

Frosh Open Season Tomorrow
Against Woodbury Forest

Washington and Lee’s freshman football team opens its
season against prep power Woodbury Forest here tomorrow.

Woodbury Forest, which won last year’s game, 28-0, de-
feated Collegiate 20-0, Saturday. Tomorrow’s game is at 2:30
p.m.

Coach Dana Swan will look to his squad’s depth—43 men
are out for the team—and it’s probably a safe bet his quarter-
backs—Andy Bloom, Richard Nash and Tom Pittman—will
do quite a bit of passing.

With 17 backs, as compared with six last season, Swan will
go with two both-way teams. The freshmen posted a 4-2 rec-
ord last year.

The cross-country team looks for its second win when it
runs against Lynchburg during the game. Coach Dick Miller’s
team defeated Roanoke, 15-50, last Friday.

Miller lost none of last season’s runners to graduation.

A final tabulation, complete with
breakdowns of the class voting, will
appear in the Friday edition.

Two voting stations were set up;
one in front of Washington Hall,
and the other at the entrance to the
Freshman Quad. Both were manned
from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. All un-
dergraduates, law, and graduate
students were eligible to vote. Facul-
ty members were encouraged to
cast their ballots, but these were not
counted with the student votes. The|
poll was not announced prior to
today, so that the results would not
be affected by block-voting tactics.
Students were on their honor not to

than the 69-vote plurality he receiv-
ed. Predictions overheard at poll-
places included: “It’s Barry with
90 per cent.” and “He’ll win (Sen-
ator Goldwater) 5 to 1.” There were
no voices raised in anticipitation of
a Johnson victory, but these first
returns ended Johnson supporters’
fear of a complete rout. The fact that
the ratio was four and one-half
to 5 and one-half in favor of Senator
Goldwater was encouraging in itself.
Final returns may trim the Repub-

Kodak Contributes $1,800

To WG@L

To “Meet Rising Costs” of University

Washington and Lee University
has received an unrestricted direct
grant of $1,800 from Eastman Kodak
under the company’s aid-to-educa-
tion program for 1964.

Washington and Lee is one of 62
privately supported colleges and uni-
versities to receive direct grants
from the company this year. The
grants are based on the number >f
graduates from these institutions
who joined Kodak five years ago
and are presently employed by the
company.

Kodak has contributed $3,800 in
direct grants to Washington and Lee
since 1955. This year’s grant is based
on Joseph E. Kling, 52, who is em-
ployed at Eastman Chemical Pro-
ducts, Ine.

The grants are designed to help
compensate schools for the difference
between the actual cost of educat-
ing men and women now with Ko-
dak and the amounts these grad-
uates may have paid in tuition and
fees.

“Through these direct grants, Ko-
dak recognizes the importance of
higher education in the supply of

said Kodak president William S..
Vaughn.

Under the direct grants plan,
Kodak contributes $600 for each full
year of academic work completed
by an employee who has received
a bachelor or graduate degree at a
privately supported college or uni-

Over-all, Kodak’s contribution in
support of higher education will
total $1.5 million in 1964. The pro-
gram includes direct grants, research
grants, grants to liberal arts col-
leges, special gifts in support of
capital or endowment programs, and
a number of other contributions.

The company’s program of finan-
cial aid to higher education is de-
signed to help schools meet rising
costs and to recognize and encourage
excellence in American colleges and
universities.

Veeps Named
For Openin gs
By President

The President of the Soph-
omore Class and of Openings
Weekend, Bill Jeffress, an-
nounced his choice of one jun-
ior and four sophomores to

serve as Vice-Presidents of
Openings, October 16 and 17. Jeffress,
who has signed James Brown, has
promised an outstanding weekend
to start off the year.

Joe Miller, a junior Delta Tau
Delta, is head of the cocktail party
committee. The cocktail party will
take place at the Moose Lodge Fri-
day afternoon from 4:00 to 6:00. The
Duo-Tones will provide the enter-
tainment during the first party of the
weekend.

To arouse curiosity the Decora-
tions Committee, under the di-
rection of Roger Milam, a Delt
Sophomore, has decided to keep
the theme of the dance a secret.
Milam has let it be known that
the theme would carry out a cur-
rently popular subject.

Music for the dance Friday night
will be provided by the Saints and
Sinners. The dance will be held in
Doremus Gymnasium from 9:00 to
1:00 and for the first time in some
years the dance will be semi-form-
al.

The feature part of the Friday
night dance will be the nationally
famous Shirelles, who will perform
when the Saints and Sinners take
their intermission breaks, which will
be the last twenty minutes of every
hour.

The Publicity Committee is headed
by Pete Taylor, a KA Sophomore.

1964 Homecomings

by Dave Marchese
IFC Reporter

(Today's column is the first of a
series of weekly articles concern-
ing the actions of the Inter-Fraterni-
ty Council.)

LF.C. President Steve Hibbard an-
nounced that the new LF.C. bulletin
board can be seen on the main floor
of the Student Union. All LF.C.
news and reports will be pasted
there.

It was announced by Harry Den-
nery, Z.B.T., Chairman of the For-
eign Student Committee, that this
week the three foreign students will
begin eating lunch at the different
fraternity houses. Roger Milam,
sophomore Delt, was elected this
year’s Charity Drive chairman and
Goeff Butler will be Chairman of
Town Relations.

The LF.C, Rush Committee re-
ported that three freshmen had
pledged fraternities after the two-
week deferred rush waiting period
ended, Wendall Winn and Jody
Kline went to Phi Kappa Sigma
while Ric Meiser pledged Phi

The main point of business on the
agenda concerned Homecoming
Weekend. Mr. William Washburn,
Alumni Secretary, spoke before the
Council and gave a rundown of the
Homecoming’s schedule. Friday night
there will be a pep rally at which
time the queen candidates will pre-
sent themselves. On Saturday, Mr
Washburn has promised female
cheerleaders to enliven the spirit
at the football game. After the game,
the alumni will be guests of the Uni-
versity at a cocktail party

Students Go Republican,

But LB]

Barry Increases Percentage
In Final Tally of Poll

by Wendell Winn
Staff Reporter

Final results of the Tuesday edi-
tion’s straw poll between Johnson
and Goldwater gave the Republican
candidate 59 per cent of all votes
cast, but in a faculty vote President
Johnson scored an even more im-
pressive margin, sweeping 80 per
cent of the faculty votes.

The student poll was conducted
last Friday with 439 votes cast for
Goldwater and 293 for Johnson. The
faculty poll, taken at yesterday’s
faculty meeting, was 68 to 17 in
favor of the President.

The poll, which was arranged
and sponsored by the Tuesday
edition of the Ring-tum Phi, con-

 

sisted of two voting stations: one

in front of Washington Hall and
the other at the entrance of the
Freshman Quad.

All undergraduates, law and grad-
uate students were eligible to vote.
A good percentage of the students
took time to indicate their preference
for President in the upcoming elec-
tion, for 66 per cent of the entire
student body participated.

The Frosh went Goldwater 2-1,
the Sophomores: 5-4, the Jun-
iors: 6-5, the Seniors: 3-2, and the
Law students: 3-2. The returns
from the faculty ballots indicated
an opinion which was in marked
contrast with that of the student
body as a whole; instructors in
R.0.T.C, and Physical Ed. are in-
cluded in the faculty count in
which only 17 or 20 per cent of
their votes were cast for Gold-
water and 68 or 80 per cent were
cast for Johnson. Their ratio was
4-1 for Johnson.

Committee To Review
Use Of Student Funds

The appointment of a_ student!
body Finance Committee has been!
ennounced by Jim Kulp, student
body president. The main purpose of
the committee, says Kulp, will be
to review the budgets of all organi-
zations which draw money from the
student body funds.

The new Finance Committee, the
makeup of which was determined
by the EC, consists of Mr. Sam
Rayder of the Rockbridge Nation-
al Bank, who is treasurer of the
student body fund; Jim DeYoung,
vice president of the student body
and the officer in charge of stu-
dent body spending; Fred Min-
del, EC member from the junior
class; Jere Turner and Mark Ap-
plefeld, members of the Publica-
tion Board.

Earlier this year Kulp discovered

that there has been no check on the |

spending of the student body funds
for a number of years, and that the
student body Finance Committee,
which is designated in the Constitu-
tion of the student government, had
been allowed to become defunct.

Prog ressive’s

Elect Officers

The Progressive Party, the min-
ority campus political party, an-
nounced its officers for the 1964-65
school year last night. The party
elected John Heinzerling, Chairman
and Frank Bailey, Secretary-Treas-
urer.

 

Heinzerling, an SAE freshman law
student from Houston, Texas, is a
dorm counselor and a member of the
Student Control Committee this year.
He has also served in past years |
as President and Vice-President of
his fraternity.

Bailey, a Kappa Sigma junior from
Fort Worth, Texas, is presently vice-|
president of his fraternity. He served |
in a high capacity on the famed
Texas Delegation of last year's mock
convention

Heinzerling and Bailey expres- |
sed confidence that the Progres-
sive Party would continue to put
ferth the best qualified candidates
for student body and class officers.
“Hf the time ever came when an
inferior candidate had to be pre-
sented, the party would not nom-
inate rather than cast off the
reputation it has gained for bring-
ing to the student bedy's atten-
tion only the most outstanding
men.

 

“We were most pleased with the
results of last year's elections. These
indicated to us that the student
body will vote for the man and not
the party. We hope that such will be
the case in the upcoming election in
the freshman Heinzerling
stated. The Progressive Party is
now composed of five houses fac-
ing the “Big Clique” ten-house Lib-|
erty Party

class,”

The Progressives include the Phi)
Gams, the Kappa Sigs, the SAE’s,

| the Phi Psi's, and the Zebes i

 

Kulp explained to the Ring-tum
Phi that the EC felt that this situa-

tion was encouraging careless spend- |

ing and wastage. Some organizations,
he said, are spending needlessly be-
cause they know they are entitled
to a certain amount of money; other
organizations are under-financed be-

cause of outmoded distribution ratios. |
which draw|

The organizations
money from the student body funds
are the Calyx, the Ring-tum Phi, the
Southern Collegian, the Glee Club
the Debate Team, the Cheerleaders,
the Student Bar Association, and the
Executive Committee. Some of these
organizations take almost no money
from the funds available, but oth-
ers—the three publications in par-
ticular—require student funds sup-
port for continued existence.

The student body fund is the re-
cipient of a ten dollars activities fee
from each student in the fall, paid in
the registration Ine. The percentage
of the fund available to each organi-
zation, according to Mr. Rayder, has
not changed since World War II.

Investigate Spending

The Finance Committee plans to
begin an investigation of financial
procedures of the Dance Board and
the Publications Board, particularly

considering the salaries paid by both |

bodies.

Kulp, however, stressed that the
committee has not been set up for
investigative purposes, but in “an
attempt to follow the constitution”
and to bring order and effectiveness
to student government.

Sweeps Faculty

It was evident from the results of
the early returns on Friday that
Lyndon Johnson was not going to
suffer the overwhelming defeat that
many Goldwater supporters had an-
ticipated and thus the LBJ-men
were encouraged by the hope that
he might narrow the margin after
the afternoon votes had been tab-
ulated. The final results, however,
did not vary greatly from the earl-
ier 55 per cent talley in favor of
Goldwater.

These results, needless to say,
came as quite a surprise to many
who were confident that the Ari-
zona Senator’s majority would be
much greater. Not including fresh-
men, a total of 450 students voted
with 256 or 56 per cent going for
Goldwater and 194 or 44 per cent
supporting Johnson. It is evident
that it was the vote of the Fresh-
man class which threw such great
emphasis upon the Republican vic-
tory, for it had the largest repre-
sentation at the poll, casting 183
votes or 64.8 per cent for Gold-
water and 99 or 35.2 per cent for
Johnson.

About half of the Sophomores en-
tered their preference with 85, 56.3
per cent, votes for the Arizona Sen-
ator and 66, 43.7 per cent, votes for
LBJ. The Junior Class had a fair
turnout; 63 went for Goldwater and
52 stood by Johnson. 74 out of the
Senior Class supported Goldwater
and 52 supported Johnson.

Not very many from the law school
voted: 34 were for Goldwater and 23
east their ballots for Johnson.

These results are indicative of the
conservative trend which has dom-
inated the political outlook at Wash-
ington and Lee for many years. Al-
though Goldwater won by a respec-
table margin, it is obvious that
Johnson can claim enthusiastic and
significant support at W&L. In the
| next straw poll, which is scheduled
closer to the actual election date,
| November 3, the results may be even
| closer.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Walk Out on Hazing

The sophomores of 18 fraternities have al-
ready begun to take their annual revenge on
the freshmen. Now the pledges of each fra-
ternity will have to pay for the fact that last
year, the present sophomores suffered through
hazing; and that now they are in a position
to have their own fun. A column in the Friday
Ring-tum Phi urging that the pledges refuse
to submit evidently has had little effect so far;
several fraternities have already held “rallies”
without protest on the part of the victims.

But it’s never too late. If the freshmen take
the advice given them by the Friday column-
ist, they can avoid repetations of these dark-
age ordeals. If they organize and give the
death-blow to rallies, they will better prove
themselves worthy of fraternity membership
than if they meekly endure all the degrada-
tion, the wasted time and effort which the
sophomores hold so dear.

And if the fraternities themselves will admit
the worthlessness of physical ordeals and of
degrading the freshmen, they will have pre-
sented one of the best evidences possible that
they are worthy of continued existence at this
University and at all schools. They will have
proved that they are capable of discarding the
useless husks of the past and of accepting the
reality of the present. Fraternities can do
this by replacing hazing with purely constrc-
tive pledge programs. In the long run the
benefits from such a change are enormous—
including earning the respect of the adminis-
tration and faculty, and also improvement of
the physical facilities of each fraternity, by
the work of the pledges.

Yet if the fraternities refuse change—then
the freshmen are bound to take the initiative.
Sooner or later the pledges are going to walk
out on hazing—it only takes one concerted
effort—and they are going to insist on intelli-
gent and constructive pledge programs. The
sooner the better.

A Victory In Disguise

The results of Friday’s Johnson-Goldwater
poll on campus were genuinely heartening to
supporters of Lyndon Johnson, despite the
fact that Goldwater carried 58 per cent of the
750 students who voted. Johnson men fig-
ured that if Goldwater can carry only 58 per
cent of Washington and Lee, a traditionally
conservative and Republican school, he stands
to take a severe beating in terms of the na-
tional electorate on November 3. The student
mock election, then, was really a victory for
Johnson, even though the President carried
only 42 per cent of the votes cast.

The significance of Washington and Lee
results can be seen only in comparison with
the results of past election polls of the student
body. In 1952, General Eisenhower, the Re-
publican conservative candidate, carried over
75 per cent of Washington and Lee students
in a mock election. During the 1956 election
there were apparently no polls taken, but pre-
sumably Eisenhower maintained somewhat of
a lead over Mr. Stevenson. In 1960 Richard
Nixon also carried over 75 per cent of stu-
dents here; once again the Republican, the
conservative, ran far stronger at Washington
and Lee than he did in the nation. If Senator
Goldwater's strength at this school is running
as far ahead of his national strength as did
Eisenhower's and Nixon’s, the Republican
nominee faces a national landslide for John-
son. And why shouldn’t Washington and Lee
show Goldwater running far ahead of his na-
tional strength? The student body hasn't
changed so drastically in four years; it is still
conservative and—though less strongly —Re-
publican, The Young Republilcans have been
more active than the Young Democrats, and
they are much, much stronger in terms of
numbers. The Conservative Society here has
been pushing Goldwater incessantly for over
three years now. Goldwater's failure to win
more than 60 per cent of the votes at Wash-
ington and Lee, a natural stronghold for him,
foretells a weak national showing in Novem.
ber.

In a separate poll of the faculty, Senator
Goldwater received only a small fraction of
votes. There is little doubt that the faculty
has never before been so closely united on one
candidate in a national election; this in spite
of the fact that in 1960 the Washington and
Lee faculty went to Richard Nixon, not the
more liberal Mr. Kennedy. All this is enough
to make us believe that the national polls
showing President Johnson with over 60 per
cent of the decided voters, must be correct,
There is a tendency to discount such polls-

but this year it is hard to see how they could
be wrong.

With these polls hanging darkly over his
head—yesterday’s Gallup Report showed him
with 32 per cent of the votes—Senator Gold-
water is saying nothing to encourage support.
It is refreshing to watch a political candidate
stick to his guns to the end—but in doing so
the Senator convinces us more and more
that he is not a reasonable choice for the
presidency. Last week at Cincinnati he con-
demned the Democratic administration for
trying to come to an “accommodation” with
the Soviet Union. How the Senator plans to
continue his and the nation’s existence without
accommodation is uncertain. But he makes it
crystal-clear that in his mind there is not room
on earth for both American democracy and
Russian Communism as it exists today, And
he is also clear on what he would do about
“accommodation”: if elected, Goldwater pro-
poses to call a quick NATO conference to
“mobilize the resources of the free world”
against Communism. It need not be said that
this is precisely the attitude which could lead
the country into a war: unless the U.S. and
the Soviet Union accommodate their differ-
ences, their conflict must inevitably reach the
stage at which one side or the other will resort
to arms.

It is his inability to see the other side which
made Goldwater a loner in the Senate, which
precluded his being a truly influential senator.
This explains the fact that no important legis-
lation bears his name. Mr. Goldwater indeed
suffers in comparison with Lyndon Johnson,
whose abilities were quickly recognized by his
fellow Senators, and who was acclaimed as
one of the ablest Majority Leaders in Senate
history. Goldwater’s single dissenting votes in
the Senate prove him one of the most cour-
ageous men in Washington; but they contrast
very bleakly with Johnson’s success in the pas-
sage of legislation, both as Majority Leader
and as President. For two terms Barry Gold-
water stood in the Senate and said “No!” to
the American people; now it is time for the
American people to say “No!” to Senator
Goldwater.

The New Rush System

The I.F.C. rush report published in last
Friday’s Ring-tum Phi was a much-needed
comment on a subject that has hardly been
broached this fall. It is rather surprising that
there has not been more discussion of the
newly revised rush system, since rush week is
so important to the fraternity men on cam-

us.
, The LF.C. report did mention the problem
created for the houses which did not have
the “big national name.” As might be expect-
ed, these houses had a lesser percentage of
freshmen sign up to see them for open houses.
These same houses began with somewhat of a
disadvantage under the old system and the
new system has certainly not helped the sit-
uation for them. The only solution to the
problem seems to be to require freshmen to
see all eighteen houses during the open house
period.

Such a requirement would involve a number
of other difficulties that arose over rush week.

Either there would have to be an extra day|~

of open houses (probably meaning an extra

day of rush week) or the open houses would

have to be shortened. The second alternative
is out of the question since the general opin-
ion during rush week seemed to be that the
open houses were too short as they stood.

The open houses were especially short for
the houses that had to walk the freshmen to
and from the dorms. These houses usually
found that they had only about a half an hour
to meet more boys than are normally at a rush
date. This confusion almost defeated the basic
and commendable idea behind the open
houses. Thus it would seem a more needed
change to lengthen the actual open house peri-
ods than to lengthen the intervals between
them, as the IFC has considered.

The addition of only ten minutes to the
open house period would not only make the
open houses more successful, but would also
do away with many of the time-limit viola.
tions which occured during the open house
period this year.

All things considered, the new rush system
and schedule are vast improvements over the

old system, The freshmen especially seemed |
| for a treasure in Prague, under the

to comprehend the system, which speaks
well of the LF.C.’s work during the summer
and at freshman camp. Those few kinks that
do remain in the system will hopefully be
worked out by the LF.C. before next year.

Gravy Train Politics Hit By Lamb

by Lamar Lamb
Tuesday Columnist

Washington and Lee has long been
plagued with an inefficient and cor-
rupt method of choosing its cam-
pus leaders. Men have been chosen
as nominees of the
various political
parties purely on
the basis of fra-
ternity (as a
member of a cer-
tain house or be-
cause of having
- no fraternal mem-
bership).

Many times par-
ties have nomin-
ated men who
were completely
unqualified and incapable of doing
the job at hand. Many times the best
candidate has been left to sit and
wonder in silence because it was not
his house’s “turn” or because eight
or nine men of average intelligence,
or worse decided he wasn’t the man
they wanted in office.

The political parties, as is well
known, are run by one represen-
tative from each fraternity, in an
atmosphere of secrecy, double-
dealing, conniving, and under-
handedness. This pitiful and ri-
diculous picture could indeed be
seen as a laughable mockery were
it not for the few officials of real
significance on campus—offices |
which are filled by the selections |

 

of our heroes of the smoke-filled
rooms,

Choices of Expediency

The fruits of the present system
are sundry and bitter. Our student
government works like an old auto-
mobile: some parts work, some
don’t. The political parties often
manage to put in a truly qualified
person, but many times don’t. In
any case, the good as well as the
bad is largely accidental, because the
basis for choice is most often ex-
pediency or an outright power push.

Another harmful effect is that
many people who would be intelli-
gent and efficient office holders and
who would like to do things for the
school, just don’t have the chance.
This inevitably brings on a third re-
sult which always occurs with tight
control and corruption. It is that the
student body at large develops a
cynical indifference to campus poli-
tics in general. For very good rea-
son, the attitude grows that “It
doesn’t concern me anyway.” Poli-
tics at W&L is a realm of activity
that can concern only a small num-
ber of students—a sort of power elite
who stubbornly cling to a stagnant
system, because in that system rests
their whole justification.

Open Primaries

What is the solution to this prob-
lem? Many men who are aware of
the problems our student govern-
ment faces believe that a system of

open primaries should be instituted
to choose the candidates for of-
fice. I am one who believes that this
would be a long step in the right
direction. It would allow students to
have some say in who represents
them, and it would give the genu-
inely intersted candidate a chance
to express their views and their in-
terest.

In partial answer to this prob-
lem, both editions of the Ring-
tum Phi are supporting a primary
for freshman EC elections. In two
weeks, the representative for the
freshman class to the Executive
Committee will be sworn in. Hope-
fully, though this primary, the
new representative will be one
who is the genuine choice of his
class and not the toy of oligarchs.

Preferential Ballots

There is a ballot printed in this
paper for Freshmen to fill out in
order to express their preference in
the upcoming election. Hopefully,
the freshmen will participate in this
effort to assure Washington and Lee
of a truly representative and efficient
government.

Perhaps the class of ’68 will be
the first freshman class in Wash-
ington and Lee to choose its own
representative. For the good of the
class, for the good of Washington
and Lee, the freshmen will throw
off the unreasonable and unneces-
sary repression of party politics.

Maybe It’s Hidden Under Y our Own Stove

by Bert Phillips
Tuesday Columnist

The other day a Lexington Sage
told me a story which made quite
an impression, and I shall relate it
to you since we all love stories

“Rabbi Bunam used to tell young
men who came to him for the first
time the story of Rabbi Eizik, son
of Rabbi Yekel of Cracow. After
many years of great poverty which
had never shaken his faith in God,
he dreamed someone bade him look
bridge which leads to the king's
palace

When the dream occurred a third
time, Rabbi Eizik prepared for the
journey and set out for Prague. But
the bridge was guarded day and)

night and he did not dare to start
digging. Nevertheless he went to
the bridge every morning and kept
walking around it until evening
Finally the captain of the guards,

Frosh Footballers Edged By
Last Minute Passing Attack

Woodberry Forest, 13-7;
Brings Tiger Victory

by Dave Dougherty
Tuesday Sports Writer
Before a sparce opening day gathering on Wilson Field
Saturday, the Washington and Lee freshmen fell to a last min-
ute onslaught by Woodberry Forest which brought the visiting

Tigers a 13-7 victory.
The win was the second in a

row for coach Red Caughron’s

Bengals, who are always a Virginia prep titan. In taking this

bout, Woodberry had to penetrate®
a rugged General defense which had
quieted the potent Tiger thrust for
three quarters. The Foresters fin-
ally turned the trick by mixing
a strong passing attack with power-
ful off-tackle blasts.

Coach Dana Swan's Generals, led
by signal caller Tom Pittman, had
several wisps of glory in the open-
ing half, but it was basically a de-
fensive struggle which saw only one
major break. A W&L fumble deep
in its own territory gave Wood-
berry a good opportunity. However,

the strong W&L defense, aided
by two  fifteen-yard penalties,
pushed the Tigers into a fourth-and-
thirty-nine situation which was
hushed by the first-half gun.

With Pittman running the keeper
to perfection and hitting his targets
with flawless aerials, the Generals
quickly took the initiative in the
second half and scored midway in
the third quarter on a two-yard

 

burst by quarterback Pittman.| tle time remaining.

 

 

Throughout the sixty-yard drive the
Generals were led by the powerful
running of Jim Elliott and Luke
Crosland, who added the seventh
point with a perfect placement.

The roof fell in for Washington
and Lee in the final quarter as Will
Lassiter started hitting his big ends,
Temple Grassi and Hy Young, with
look-in and flare passes and Ron
Fisher and John MacCorkle started
breaking the General bulwark Fish-
er scored the first Woodberry tal-
ly with a three-yard burst, but a
stiff rush caused a poor PAT effort
and the Generals held a slim 7-6
lead.

W&L was forced to relinquish the
ball with less than four minutes re-
maining in the game, and the Tigers
began a devastating air attack. From
the one MacCorkle took it in for the
victory. Lassiter’s successful kick
made the score 13-7 with very lit-

The Best Sports News On Campus

 

 

by

A member of the athletic department was asking the other day why
the student body here seems to be nonchalant about the sporting events.
He just couldn’t understand why no one comes to see the games. The
only answer he received was that there is no school spirit at W&L.

For the freshmen who haven’t heard, attendance is just plain lousy
at almost every athletic activity. The football games attract a surpris-
ingly small percentage of the student body and most of these “true”
fans leave at halftime, no matter what the score may be. It is true
that in the past W&L has not been noted for exciting football. The run-
ning backs and linemen have been the type of players that make ball
control advantageous.

The idea of football is to win anyway you can. This season, though,
it appears that the Generals will be playing more open ball because of
a general lack of size in the line and because of a passer like Larry
Craig and receivers like Bill David. Still the crowds will be sparse.

Canfield Plans a Fast Basketball Game

Basketball never draws well because the team doesn’t win. Also the
slow down style of last year is not particularly conducive at attracting
spectators. Coach Verne Canfield has the solution to draw a crowd. He
wants his own pep band and also wants to have the football team as an
organized rooting section. He intends to utilize the fast break more than
it has been used in recent seasons. The fast break is a definite crowd
pleaser.

The remainder of the sports, with the exception of wrestling, attract
very few people. Yet, the soccer and lacrosse teams have been having
good success in recent years.

Will This Year Be Any Different

Some players quit because they seem to think that their coach will
let them play even though they come to only half the practice sessions.

For the skeptical freshmen who don’t believe that there is little school
spirit here, attend the opening home football game on October 17
against Susquehanna. The Crusaders walloped Randolph-Macon, 42-0, in
their opener, and Macon defeated the Generals, 8-0, in W&L’s opener.

Add to that the fact that the seventeenth is Opening’s Weekend, and
you can guess about what size crowd will be there for the game, and about
how many will be there by halftime.

Or will this year be different?

Miscues Slow First-Half Drives

By Skip Chase
Tuesday Sports Writer
After a rather lackluster first half, Washington and Lee
came alive in the second half Saturday to score three touch-
downs on its way to a 21-0 victory over Oberlin College. It
was the General’s first victory this season and evened their
overall record at one win and one loss.

W&L’s stout defensive withheld repeated assaults by Ober-
lin and the referees in the first half.*

 

 

In the opening five minutes the ref-
erees gained more yards than the
Yeomen as th Generals were pen-
alized ninety yards. W&L also ad-
ded to their own woes with a fum-
ble and pass interception. Indeed,
the Blue and White did everything
but allow Oberlin yardage.

The Generals drove down the field
in the third quarter only to be stop-
ped on the four-yard line. A short
Oberlin punt gave the General
“Blue” team another chance, and
this time they scored on a fourth
down pass play—Larry Craig to Bill
David—from the Yeoman five. Cary
Green added to conversion and the
Generals took command.

Sparks Scores Second TD

Oberlin failed to move following
the kickoff and punted to the visi-
tors’ “Go” team, who went. Run-
ning outside the second unit rolled
down field; each play moving the
Oberlin linebackers wider and wid-
er. Then, two successive fullback

 

Harriers Cop Third Win

W&L’s cross country team won its
third straight meet of the season
defeating Lynchburg College, 21-40,
Saturday on Wilson Field.

The Generals took seven of the
first nine places. Captains Andy Kil-
patrick and Riff O’Connor placed
first and second respectively with
times of 25:17 and 25.36.

Since W&L was without two of its
five performers—-Lee Johnson and
Charlie Head, the Generals displayed
top performance in a team effort.
Next Friday the Generals travel to
Bridgewater College.

 

 

traps up the middle sent Tom Sparks
into the end-zone. Green’s second
conversion attempt went wide, but
but W&L now led 13-0.

Oberlin then mounted a drive that
took them to the W&L thirty-yard
line. An exchange of punts gave the
Blue and White another chance from
their own forty with some six min-
utes left in the game. A series of
jabs that included several passes
to David and one to Tersh Baker
put W&L on the Oberlin five. From
there fullback John Anthony, the
Generals leading ground-gainer,
banged for six on the identical trap
play that scored Sparks. Skip Chase
had his path swept clean by blocks
on the way in for the two point con-
version. The Generals’ third unit
amassed still another drive before
time ran out with Washington and
Lee in possession.

Next Saturday the traveling men
from W&L will journey to Danville,

| Kentucky, for their third straight

away game this season. The Wash-
ington and Lee-Centre contest
marks the Generals’ first contest with
a College Athletic Conference op-
ponent. Centre opened its confer-
ence slate by losing last Saturday
to Southwestern, 28-7. Earlier the
Colonels dropped a game to Mary-
ville, 21-6, and played to a 0-0 tie
with Wilmington.

‘Civil War Round Table, Meets

To Discuss This

W&L Civil War “buffs” now have |
an outlet for their energies in the|
newly organized Washington and|
Lee Civil War Round Table. Under |
the advisorship of Dr. Charles Turn-
er, Professor of History, the club)
will meet monthly to discuss various |
aspects of Civil War study. Meet-
ings will be held on the last Tues-
day of every month.

The first meeting of the W&L Civil
War Round Table took place last
night in duPont 1. Those attending
included Charles Lewis, '68; Nat
Clement, ’67; Michael Herman, ’67;
Robert A. Davis, 68; Peter H. Hol-
ler, ’68; and Steven R. Saunders,
68.

Lewis and Saunders were desig-
nated to arrange for the speaker and
program at the October 27 meeting.
It was decided that programs will be
limited to one hour

Variety of Projects

Projects discussed ran the gamut
from fieldtrips to nearby battle sites
and historical landmarks, to the pre-
sentation of vintage motion picture
films relating to the Civil War peri-
od.

Among future programs will be
talks by local and nationally known
historians.

Operating with no formal adminis-
trative hierarchy, the club plans to
function as a small group so that
each member may derive the great-
est benefits from his membership.

The group is billed as non-parti-
san, and non-political. Interested
students may address inquiries to

time the team had to come from be-
hind to win.
Team Effort Brought Victory

“All out team effffort, anticipation,
and experience gave us victory,”
said Coach Lyles. The game could
have gone either way for the Gen-
erals or Yellow Jackets, but the
right breaks, hustling, and the will
to win paid off. The team has the
possibility to go undefeated. But as
Coach Lyles emphasized, “The team
is taking each game one at a time.
It is not looking toward any one par-
ticular game.”

Thursday the Generals play host
to Belmont Abbey here at 3:15. This
is a rescheduled game due to Guil-
ford College’s dropping its soccer
program.

Movies Have Peculiar Reality Which Other Media Lack

so, and thus I consider it a great
work of art.

For some, literature is the me-
dium, for some it is painting, for
some it is music, but film, I would
suggest, is the art form which all,
(or most, or at any rate, more) can
appreciate. Not that it comes auto-
matically or easily. It doesn’t. But
the film has a peculiar reality which
other artistic mediums somehow
lack. Perhaps this is because words,
sounds, sights, and motion are all
combined in the motion picture,
something that literature, painting
and music can’t do. (The theater is
another matter for another day.) And
it is this peculiar reality which gives
to the film its universal intelligibili-
ty. All this, of course, is just my own
opinion, and to those who disagree
I can only say—go, look, think, and
then judge for yourself.

Saunders, Kline, Reynolds Lead EC Poll

In an unannounced Freshman
Executive Committee preferential
poll taken Tuesday night, the Class
of ’68 indicated that they consider-
ed Steve Saunders, Jody Kline, Joe
Matthews, Ed Armentrout, John
Reynolds, and Richard Nash the men
most qualified to hold elective po-
sition.

Steve Saunders, from Elmont, New
York, drew the highest number of
votes with 34. Second was Jody
Kline from Sault Ste Marie, Mich-
igan, with a total of 23. Close be-
hind Kline with 18 votes was John
Reynolds from Madison, Tennessee.
Fifth in the tally was Ed Armen-
trout from Brownsburg, Virginia,
with 14 votes. Joe Matthews of Mar-
ion, Virginia, collecting 12 votes, is
the only other freshman to receive
10 or more votes.

The poll, conducted by the Ring-
tum Phi, in which 175 freshmen cast
votes, was announced with the print-
ed ballots in the Tuesday Edition.
Ballot boxes were positioned
throughout the Commons and the
poll was taken and completed in a
short time. The purpose of the sec-
recy was to prevent anly group of
freshmen, either through the efforts
of a fraternity to nominate one of
its own pledges, or through a group
of independent freshmen to nomi-

nate an individual who has promised
favortism to them, from uniting and
forming a block vote for reasons
other than personal preference. In
this effort the poll was successful.

Other significant vote-getters in-
clude Barry Levin of Norfolk, with
9 votes; Dave Riley of Richmond,
with 7; Lane Steinger of Creve
Coeur, Missouri, with 6 votes; and 6
votes also to Jady Cady of Mem-
phis. Six received 5 votes while 10
received 4.

The purpose of the preferential poll
was to offer the freshmen a choice in
the selection of their own candidates
for the EC post. The established sys-
tem of the past has depended upon a
clique of upperclassmen who have
determined the candidates of each
party.

Steve Saunders

Steve Saunders who held an 11 vote
lead over the next man, served as
Chief Justice of the Student Court,
President of the Quill and Scroll so-

of the Key Club, and Parliamentarian
of the Student Council while in high
school. During this time he also held
the position of governor of the New
York District of the Key Club, and
was a class officer for four years.
Saunders has pledged ZBT. On cam-

 

pus, he is a Ring-tum Phi staff mem-
ber, co-program chairman of the Civ-
il War Round Table, a member of the

Burke Tells Young GOP's
Of Barry’s 1964 Strategy

Bill Burke, a freshman law student at W&L, told a group

of over 100 Young Republicans from W&L and Maty Baldwin
College of his experiences as demonstration director for Sena-
tor Barry Goldwater at the Republican National Convention.
Burke spoke before the first meeting of the local Young Re-

publicans Club Wednesday.

The W&L organization supported
a motion to support Goldwater and
and Roy Erickson, Seventh Con-
gressional candidate who is trying
to unseat W&L alumnus John
Marsh, in a short business which
preceded Burke's address.

The group, however, defeated a
proposal to endorse Richard A. May
who is seeking election against Dem-
ocratic Senator Harry F. Byrd.

Dr. Charles Phillips, faculty mem-
ber and president of the Rockbridge
County-Buena Vista Republican
Club, delivered a few remarks in
which he emphasized the necessity

of working together for the remain-|
der of the campaign, and stressed the |

need for intra-party unity.
Burke who headed Goldwater's
campaign in the Washington and Lee

Mock Convention, joined the Ari-|

zona senator's personal staff

summer

Burke served on Goldwater's re-|
Francisco |

search staff at the San
convention. Research, however, was
not the full extent of his duties,
as was brought out during his talk.
Along with Don Shafter, a law stu-
dent at the University of Michigan,
Burke was in charge of the Gold-
water demonstrations at the con-
vention. Many of the colorful dem-
onstration ideas were Burke's
handicraft. This included the mil-
lion pieces of gold foil dropped from
the rafters when Goldwater was
nominated

Particular attention was called
to the organization of Goldwater
forces. Burke said that delegate or-
ganization was started four years
ago, and continued to the last min-
ute before balloting began

“You've heard that the convention

was managed; that it was Gold-
water's convention!” said Burke
“Well, that’s true. We knew where

every delegate was every minute for
two weeks.”

By means of huge banks of com-
nunications paraphanalia—ineluding
valkie-talkies, and full-wired phone
given delegate

connec Lons-any

eould be located and contacted with-|

in five minutes from one of three dil-

ferent communication sources

Other electronic gadgets utilized
by the Senator's workers included
computers which could feed back
within fifteen minutes whatever
senator Goldwater had said on any
ibject. Thirty thousand pages of)
nateri al was rit rofilmed ior the |
convention, Burke reve sled that a}

nilar set-up with 20,000 pages of)

tatements, speeches, and writ

 

ing of President Johnson had been
indexed for the regular campaign.
In order to safeguard these and other
campaign devices, heavy
precautions were taken, including
special guards at every entrance and
exit of the Goldwater headquarters,
which covered two floors of
Mark Hopkins Hotel.

“A great deal of Senator Gold-
| water’s efforts have been aimed at
youth,” Burke noted, “because he
realized that this year their would
be 1.25 million college people vot-
ing for the first time.” Over 1,000
young people worked for Goldwater
at the convention. Burke said that
without the assistance of these young
| people, “ our task would have
been just about impossible.”

Burke found the Republican Pres-
idential candidate to be “very
| friendly,” and “personally very
tractive

Goldwater's friendliness was man-
ifested many ways, according to
Burke. “He took time to remember
the names of staff members, and al-
ways had a good word for every-
| body.”

The convention ran like clock-
work, with no slip-ups, Burke said
He compared the San Francisco con-

EC Approves
Wheeler’s Plan

For Control

At last Tuesday's Executive Com-
mittee meeting, President Jim Kulp
called on Joe Wheeler, Chairman of
the Student Control Committee, to
present to th E.C. the policy his com-
| mittee intends to follow this year.
The plan will be the same as last)
year’s except that the Student Control
Committee will urge the girl schools’
judiciary committees to weed out the
impertinent complaints so as reduce
the volume of unnecessary work ior
the Student Control Committee. The |
E.C. accepted Wheeler's plan for his |
committee.

 

 

Next, Jim DeYoung was called upon |
to give the budget of the Student Fin-
ance Committee. DeYoung said that
the budget would have to be higher
this year because many student-spon-
sored organizations ran in the red last
year, Therefore, the activities fee, said |
De Young, was raised to two dollars
this year to compensate for a possible
deficite. The extra money was di-
vided up among the organizations ac-
cording to their needs.

The Finance Committee also de-
cided to give part of the extra in-
come to the Student Bar Association
because it was felt that the under-
graduates are in a better financial po-
sition to assume a little more of the
financial burden than the law stu-
dents, most of whom are married, The

E.C. also adopted the finance program

Finally, a letter from the Associated
Student Governments of the United
States was read by Kulp. It requested
that Washington and Lee send a repre-
sentative to its national meeting on
November 26-29. There was some de-

Jack Baber will be the Dance

function of the Coordinator is to act
as a liaison between the Dance
Board and the individual dance
set presidents. Jobs such as main-
taining rest rooms, tuning the piano,
and replacing spotlights are also
duties of the Coordinator.

Dance Board President Steve Hib-
bard feels that the creation of these
new posts will distribute the work
and responsibilities more evenly
among Board members. Chairmen
for all of the Dance Board Com-
mittees are selected yearly through
applications and interviews.

Within the next week the Board

| will canvass every fraternity in an

attempt to sell Dance Plans. “The
Dance Plan,” remarks Steve Hib-
bard, will be a great saving not only
for its owner, but also for any off
campus guest he may have.” The
sale of these Dance Plans stops
Wednesday, October 12.

The Dance Board has some pro-
posals which must be kept secret;
however, Steve has let it be known
that the Board is working on several
petitions to “liven spirits” at these
dance sets. The first petition was
to make Openings Dance informal
by making suits the acceptable dress
instead of tuxedos.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

A Positive Endorsement Of Lyndon B. Johnson

President Lyndon Baines Johnson receives the full en-
dorsement of the Friday edition of the Ring-tum Phi as the
most qualified candidate for the office of President of these
United States. That both the Tuesday and Friday staffs of the
paper agree on this is unusual, nevertheless, it goes beyond
that in its implications.

The Friday Ring-tum Phi deplores the current nega-
tive trend in the voters’ attitude; it seems that one only votes
against a candidate, not for his opponent. In their editorial
endorsement,we feel that the Tuesday Edition shares this nega-
tive attitude; they would support Johnson against Goldwater,
not so much on the merits of Johnson’s ability and personality,
as because they are opposed to Goldwater’s way of thinking.
Certainly this is a factor in the present campaign; however,
the completely negative theme of this campaign causes us to
react positively. Let’s examine the reasons why President John-
son should be re-elected, instead of the reasons why Senator
Goldwater should not.

Accomplishments

During the last four years, the Kennedy-Johnson Adminis-
tration has made outstanding progress in quite a number of
fields:

% Economic growth has proceeded at a rapid pace, stim-
ulated by a prudent cut in federal taxes.

According to the U.S, News and World Report (September
7, 1964):

“The four Kennedy Johnson years have been
marked by a steady rise in the rate of over--all business
activity, measured in terms of ‘gross product.’

“There has been no business setback in the last four
years.”

“President Johnson has stopped a rise in federal
spending, an accomplishment that both Eisenhower and
Kennedy failed to achieve.”

% The right of every American to equal opportunity,
equal citizenship and equal access to all facilities open to the
public has been unequivocally affirmed by law.

The protection of the federal minimum wage has been
extended to millions of workers previously excluded and the
minimum itself has been increased.

% “Aprogram has been established to extend federal as-
sistance to economically depressed areas.

% Federal aid to higher education has been materially

increased.
% The most comprehensive housing program in a gen-

neni

 

eration has been enacted.

% Poverty is no longer ignored but recognized as a
chronic blight on America’s affluent society and steps have
been initiated to attack its roots.

% The military strength of the United States has been
enhanced and made more versatile; while at the same time this
country has gained, in every crisis, a new respect from friend
and foe alike.

Domestic Economic Policy

Johnson recognizes the importance of solving the problem
of unemployment and achieving full employment in Ameti-
ca as a matter of the highest priority. The Democratic plat-
form commits its candidate to a program of steady economic
advancement; to the goal of putting all Americans, who want
and can fill a job, back to work.

Johnson’s platform proposes a higher minimum wage, and
takes sound and progressive positions on housing, hospital
insurance for the aged, social security improvements, and many
other necessary domestic policies.

Foreign Policy and National Defense
The Democratic Administration in the last four years has
built a military flexibility that enables this country to refrain
from atomic war; brush-fire wars cannot be fought with an
atomic bomb, On the other hand, the Republican Party has
already alarmed our allies, through their major reliance on

 

America’s atomic superiority. The awesome weapon of atomic
supremacy can only be entrusted to the President of the United |
States.
Qualifications

An examination of the experience of President Johnson
is in order when considering his qualifications for office. Lyn-
don Johnson has been President of the United States for
nearly eleven months, was vice-President for the preceding
three years, was a senator for two six-year terms—serving for
six years as majority leader—and for eleven years sat in the
House of Representatives. He took office in 1937 and has
served continually since then.

As Vice-President, he loyally, diligently, and effectively
served President John F. Kennedy. In both foreign and do-
domestic affairs, he was a strong right hand to the President.

He assumed the office of President with unsurpassed vigor
in November of 1963. The legislative achievements of Presi-
dent Johnson’s nearly eleven months in office are the greatest
since the Roosevelt Administration. The unflagging concern
of Lyndon B. Johnson for the poor and deprived has in
truth aroused the conscience of all Americans.

In Mr. Johnson we are offered a man of vast experience
and manifest competence. In the Senate he proved himself one
of the ablest legislative leaders of the age. As President, he
has moved with sureness and responsibility through almost a
year of crises—not least of the these the crisis of assassination
and succession.

In the White House, Johnson has shown himself to be a
master legislative strategist. Never since the New Deal, has such
a large percentage (80 percent) of an administration’s pro-
gram been accepted by the Congress. Johnson is very much a
politician. The office demands a politican; we need a man
who understands power and the relationship of power as a
necessity for getting his program through. Kennedy was a
poor politican in legislative administration; only in Johnson’s
tenure of office has the Congressional stalemate been resolved.

Moreover, Lyndon Johnson’s greatest talent is the one
needed now as seldom before in our history: that of reconcil-
ing the seemingly irreconcilable, and pulling opposites into a
consensus. In a nation torn by racial and sectional strife, its di-
visions widened by the ugly passions stirred up (on both sides)
by the Goldwater candidacy, the nation needs a President who
can bind up its wounds and let it find unity again.

Johnson has repeatedly voiced an appeal to national unity.

‘This is not merely a campaign appeal; he has expressed his

deep regret at sectional factionism throughout his administra-
tion. His appeal to national unity is an appeal to unity with
purpose—an attempt to solve mutual problems. To find a
man with a greater healing influence, a man better qualified
to unite the nation, one would have to look far. Not only
would he unite the North and the South, but also the Liberals
and Conservatives, and the Executive and Legislative branches
of government.

These then are the reasons why Lyndon Baines Johnson
receives our positive endorsement for the presidency of the
United States. These are the reasons that persuaded us that
the editors of The New York Herald Tribune are correct when
they say,

“So far as these two candidates are concerned, our
inescapable choice is Lyndon B. Johnson.”

Generals Open
CAC Season
At Centre

By JOHNNY GRAHAM

Fresh from their 21-0 win over
Oberlin last Saturday the Washing-
ton and Lee football team meets
Centre College tomorrow in its first
College Athletic Conference con-
test of the season.

The Centre game, to be played in
Danville, Kentucky, could be the
key to the rest of the season. A
win would put the Generals in good
shape in the CAC race. Three con-
ference games—against Sewanee,
Southwestern, and Washington—fin-
ish the season. A win tomorrow
could, conceivably, provide the mo-
mentum necessary to upset Sus-

Letters To The Editor

(Continued from page 2)
or varsity soccer games? I don’t
think it takes long to prove to any
open mind that school spirit lacks.

I believe the time has come to
stop talking and to start doing. What
can the student body do to add that
spark of spirit that makes college
really great? Maybe the formation
of a spirit committee would be a
start. Such a group with the active
support of the fraternities and the
administration could act as a cen-
tral agency for the promotion of
spirit. How? With a cross section of
the student body represented such
an organization could begin promo-
tional campaigns, better advertising
of sparsley attended events (which
events aren’t sparsely attended) and
maybe the formation of a cheering
section as suggested in Mr. Carpen-
ter’s column.

I feel that the need for such a
plan is quite evident, only one ques-
tion remains. Is the student body
of W&L ready to lend it’s support
to improve the University through
a spirit committee?

Sincerely,
DICK CAPLAN

Ring-tum Phi Jargon
Dear Sir:

Has the English language or the
teaching of it deteriorated since my
W&L days?

I refer you, Sir, to your front-
page headline, “Left-Wingers Up-
hold Cause in Thrust.” In my days,
before The Great Conflict, clarity of
thought was expressed through pre-
cision of language. Precisely, what
does “Left-Winger” mean in Ring-
tum Phi jargon?

Does it mean, simply, Pro-LBJ—
grouping together Left-Winger Wal-
ter Reuther, Left-Winger William
Randolph Hearst, Jr., Left-Winger
Governor Harrison of Virginia, Left-
Winger Governor Sanders of Geor-
gia, ete.?

Does it mean Right of Javits, but
Left of Eisenhower?

Does it mean Right of Eisenhower,
but Left of McKinley?

Does it mean Right of McKinley,
but Left of Goldwater?

Perhaps, this last is what you
really mean, in which case your
headline should have read “Whigs
Unite To Counter Tories.”

Very truly yours,
SYDNEY LEWIS, SR.

Italian Appreciation
Dear Editor:

Here is Giancarlo Marchetti, writ-
ing from Rome, Italy. Last year I
had a chance to attend Washington
and Lee University as a sophomore.

Now your academic year has just
started, while over here we
one more month of vacation.

I want to thank every person of
the Institution through the “voice”

of W&L, since I did not have al

chance to do it personally.

I am just now appreciating what
an experience I had by living in
the US.A.; the experience has been
extremely postive, and the greater
part of my vision has ben shaped
through people, friends, professors I
met in Lexington. All the professors
and students have been understand-
ing and good to me; I have found

some of my best friends at W&L. It
is pretty hard to reajust to the in-
dividuality and complete _ self-
reliance of the Italian Educational
system, after being followed all the
year around by professors who con-
sider you as a friend more than as
a simple student. I wish I could see
all of you sometime.

By the way, if anyone of you
happens to be in Rome, please let
me know and call me; last summer I
did not see anyone of you but should
really like it. Incidentally I met only
a girl from Randolph-Macon College.

Arrivederci a tutti,

George Homans To Speak
On History of Sociology

As part of the Visiting Scholars Pro-
gram organized by the University
Center of Virginia, Washington and
Lee has been selected as a lecture stop
for Dr. George C. Homans, Professor
of Sociology at Harvard.

 

 

This internationally renowned teach-
er and lecturer will speak on “History |
and Sociology” in a talk, Tuesday eve-_
ning, October 13, at 8:00 in the du-|
Pont Hall auditorium. His lecture will |
be open to all interested persons of the |
W&L community.

Dr. Homans is comparatively unique
among modern sociologists in that he
first entered his career as a social
historian and only then moved on into
sociology. His lecture Tuesday night
will inter-relate these two fields and
show how they have affected the de-
velopment of modern history.

SUMMERTIME — and if the livin’ isn’t really easy it'll look that
way, in the colorful, easy-care sportswear that’s going to liven up
the Summer scene! Let’s take a look at it.

BRIGHTEN THE CORNER where you are

in one of the new “Three-Alarm Blazers.”
They’re just what they sound like—a
bright new breed of blazer to supplement
your traditional navy or black one. This
summer, they’re comfortably cool—most
of them in lightweight basket-weaves.
And as for color—well, look for them in
camel, or in a whole range of reds from
brilliant to burgundy, or in bottle-green.
Linings are brighter, too—from solids to
stripes to sporting motifs. Even the blazer
button brightens, with brilliant enamel
buttons to choose from, as well as metal
with insignia or crests.

FOR COMPLETE COVERAGE in the sport

jacket department, consider strong pat-
tern and definite texture. Deep, glowing
Madras plaids look new this year against
a paler, softer background. In seersuckers,
stripes are getting bolder—some as wide
as %”—and brighter: add red and white
to the more usual black, gray, tan and blue
stripes on white. Something new in seer-
sucker is the multi-color plaid, in combi-
nations like gray, red, and white; or blue,
gray and white. The look of linen is im-
portant—either pure linen, or a blend of
polyester and flax fibers. This nubby,
slubby fabric is a real smasher in the
natural tan shades!

SUMMER’S A SLACKS SEASON, with the emphasis on plain,

pleatless waistband styling, tapered legs and cuffs. Lightweight
blends of polyester and wool hold their shape and stay cool and
comfortable at the same time. In addition to your basic wardrobe
of dark slacks, you might move up into the intermediate shades—
lighter grays, clay blues and the like. For your lighter moments,
consider twill weave slacks in light, natural tan and off-white
shades—these in cotton blended with polyester for shape retention.

THEY’RE CLOSING THE GAP between

dress and woven sport shirts—these days
you can hardly tell ‘em apart without a
program! But bold and bright as dress
shirts are, the sporting type is even
brighter! Styled with your favorite, but-
ton-down collar and long sleeves, there's a
wide range of blazer stripes and big
checks to choose from—all in wild colors.
And Madras plaids are just as strong as
they ever were! Any of these shirts in
thin cottons will keep you cool in the worst
of heat waves—as will the traditional cot-
ton knit mesh pullovers.

It’s A SHORTS LIFE and a merry one,

for Summer! There's lots of color and

 

give the old heave-ho to those ragged jobs

 

erly tailored striped shorts... or Madras

| plaids.

Liberty Party
Names Kline
For Frosh EC

Jody Kline, a Phi Kappa Sigma |

pledge from Sault St. Marie, Mich.,

was nominated Sunday by the Liber- |

ty Party for the post of Executive
Committeeman representative from
the freshman class.

The Liberty Party candidate was
named by the political representa-
tives from the ten member houses
of the party at a meeting held at
the Phi Phi house. This nomination
marks the first venture into campus
politics by the Liberty Party since
its formation last spring.

Chairman Patton Adams stated

STATEMENT FROM PATTON
ADAMS, CHAIRMAN OF LIBER-
TY PARTY:

The Liberty Party has selected a
candidate worthy in every respect
to be the freshman Executive Com-
mittee representative. No compro-
mise was effected in his selection;
no appeasement was granted to
anyone; no favor was shown toward
any house. He was chosen on his
personal merits alone.

I wish to state at the outset of
this campaign that the Libery Par-
ty stands United and unrelenting
behind Jody Kline for this office.
As he goes forward to win, he will
wholeheartedly represent his Party,
but he will also represent himself—
his own qualifications, his own cap-
abilities, and his own _ initiative.
I encourage every freshman to meet
and get to know Jody, to learn
his views and, if necessary, to ques-
tion, them, and in the end to support
him for this high position.

Finally, let everyone—freshman or
senior alike—know that in every
election in the coming years this
Party will stand firm on the princi-
ple of competent, qualified candi-
dates; and will take no part in se-
lecting nominees through “double-
dealing, conniving, and underhand-
edness,” as one disgruntled, hereto-
fore active party man, and unsuc-
cessful office-seeker of last year re-
cently described campus politics. It
will be our continued desire to put
before this student body the best
men our Party has to offer.

 

dacy was clearly the choice of the
party. In addition it was noted that
Kline had already received a sub-
stantial endorsement in the freshman
class poll sponsored by the R-t P.

A graduate of Sault St. Marie High |
School, Kline served as president of |

 

W-L Conducts
A Self Analysis

By FRANK FAIRCHILD, JR.
As a member of the Southern As-
sociation of Colleges and Schools,
Washington and Lee is currently un-
dertaking a Self-Study Program.
Requiring its members to initiate
such a program every ten years,
the Association encourages the par-
ticipating colleges to improve their
educational effectiveness by review-
ing their goals, measuring their suc-
cess in achieving them, and seeking
new methods of promoting efficiency.
President Cole has appointed a
Self-Study Committee headed by Dr.
William Hinton to conduct the study.
Other members of the committe are
Deans Light, Pusey, Atwood, and
Adams, Professors Gilreath and
Jenks, and Mr. Frank Parsons.

Dr. H. Lawrence Wilsey of the
management consultant firm of
Booze, Allen & Hamilton in Chicago
will serve in an advisory capacity
to the faculty committee.

Having assisted numerous other
colleges in their long-range plan-
ning programs, Dr. Wilsey will of-
fer suggestions concerning the most
effective procedural methods that
can be used in the study.

Dr. Wilsey’s appointment is in ac-
cord with President Cole’s stated
desire to eliminate as many of the
mechanical aspects of the Self-Study
Program as possible.

It has been the experience of the
University in the past that some
phases of the program restrict the
time of both the members of the
faculty and of the administration.
President Cole hopes that Dr. Wil-
sey and the faculty committee will
be able to alleviate this problem.

his victory in the primary, the re-
sults of which were given to the
chairmen of both parties by the
Ring-tum Phi editors.

The number of freshmen voting
was 220, and the ballots gave
instructions for each voter to in-
dicate two choices; however about
half of the freshmen voted for
only one candidate. Kline totalled
111 votes, Matthews 66 votes, and
Saunders 62 xotes.

Following these three were Rich-
ard Nash with 38, and John Rey-
nolds and Ed Armentrout.

Matthews’ Qualifications
Matthews served as_ president,

vice president, and secretary of his

student body in high school. He was
captain of the football team, presi-
dent of the freshman class, vice
president of the varsity club, Citizen
of the Year, and recipient of a
school senior service award. At W&L
Matthews is on the freshman
football team and is a member of
the Federation of Christian Athletes.
He has not yet pledged a fraternity.

Steve Saunders
Saunders was Key Club governor
of New York while in high school,
and was a class officer for four years.
He was Chief Justice of the Student
Court, President of Quill and Scroll,

co-editor of the school newspaper,

and a debater.

Saunders also was President of his
Key Club and Parliamentarian of his
student council. At W&L he has
pledged ZBT fraternity, is a Ring-
tum Phi staff member, co-program
chairman of the Civil War Round
Table, a Young Republican, and a
participant in the Mission Commit-
tee of the UCA.

Kline (see Kline’s qualifications
for office elsewhere on this page)
is so far the freshman choice for
the EC office. There was no doubting
the completeness of his victory over
the other freshmen on the primary
ballot, all of whom had earned a
place on the ballot by their showing
in an earlier preferential vote.

There is a possibility that Kline's
pledge class or other pledges in his
party were pushed to vote for him,
but the other candidates in the pri-
mary could have just as well been
similarly pushed.

Poll A First
The poll was backed by both edi-
tions of the Ring-tum Phi and is the
first of its kind at Washington and
Lee.

berty Split,

Path Split In Three Years

Sees Nine Houses Regroup;
Liberty Party Disintegrates

The old University Party
which dominated the W&L
campus for many decades un-
til it broke up last year, re-
turneyl to power early this

morning as nine disgruntled
houses banded together and took
the familiar name as their own.

For the most part the nine houses
were former members of the old
Big Clique: Beta KA, Phi Delt,
PiKA, SAE, Phi Gam, EPE, Delt
and Kappa Sig. Result o fthe new
combination mean that Red Square
is split up again, with Sigma Nu
and Phi Kap left out of the Univer-
sity Party. formerly the two houses
were included in the University
bloc.

The Liberty Party, which con-
tained ten houses until last night,
and has nominated Jody Kline for
Freshman EC, was left with four
houses this morning: Sigma Nu, Phi
Kap, Pi Phi, and Lambda Chi.

The Progressive Party, which had
five houses until last night but had
not yet nominated a freshman EC
candidate, is left with two houses:
Phi Psi and ZBT.

The Remaining houses, Sigma Chi,
Phi Ep, and DU were still in the
independent column as of this morn-
ing.

Abolish Parties

Early this afternoon a number of
fraternities, including independents
and party members both, met at the
ZBT house to consider a new con-
cept of political systems and to try
to arrive at some means of abolish-
ing parties on campus altogether.
The success of this discussion was
uncertain as the Ring-t-um Phi went
went to press.

The new chairman of the Universi-
ty Party is James Jennings, and
Geof Butler is the secretary-treasur-
er. Jennings stated that the new
party formed for the purpose of
eliminating instability in politics and
in order to ensure a fully qualified
man was nominated for freshman
EC.

Nominee Nash

The nine houses nominated Rich-
ard Nash, Beta Pledge, for fresh-
man EC, which
will be decided
next Monday.
Nash was vice

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

A Word On Freshman EC Elections

Nomination to the Executive Committee
from the freshman class has traditionally been
the kiss of death to the unfortunate winners.
It is a sure sign that they will never be elected
to further office, and lately it has also been
a good indication that they won’t even grad-
uate from Washington and Lee. The reason
for this deplorable circumstance is that this
office, the only one in the freshman class, has
always been a football to be tossed around
each fall by the political parties. The cliques
have calculatedly passed around this EC post
from house to house, considering mainly the
expedient of pacifying whichever house need-
ed the prestige of an EC member.

The eight or ten men who nominate
each party’s freshman EC candidates every
year try hard to reconcile expediency with
justice; they go so far as to be fairly sure that
the man they nominate is the best-qualified
pledge of the house whose turn it may be in
any particular year. But this hasn’t been
enough. It has made the freshman EC position
a graveyard. It has usually kept the best can-
didates from being nominated. And worse, it
has been the resaon that the freshman Execu-
tive Committeeman has not been a good rep-
resentative of his class. The truth is that the
freshman Committeeman has been the repre-
sentative of the political clique of the majority
party.

Will it be the same this year? Will the
class of 1968 bloc-vote another Big Clique
candidate into office? And will this freshman
class elect another man in a succession of “‘dis-
appearing freshman EC members,” an EC
member who cannot represent his class be-
cause he was not really chosen by it? The
Tuesday Ring-tum Phi hopes that this year will
be different. This newspaper is nominally a
Liberty Party paper, but it cannot in con-
science support the existing political system.

In the hope of improving on the present
system of nominating freshman EC candi-
dates, both editions of the Ring-tum Phi have
sponsored a preferential balloting, and then
a primary. These polls have established no
official machinery, of course; but they have
given the freshmen a voice, which is at least
a good precedent. The polls brought forth a
number of good candidates for office, and
publicized their qualification to hold office. If
anything further is done, the freshmen them-
selves will have to do it. They can act as their
fraternities instruct them, as they have done
traditionally. Or, the freshmen can take things
into their own hands and refuse to be used.
They can see to it that there is some choice
offered in this election, not just the dictates of
the little men from the smoke-filled rooms.
If the parties don’t nominate the best men,
the freshmen can easily enough make their
own nominations. How this is to be done
from here, is up to the class as a whole, and
to those men who have received support in the
primary and preferential voting. But it can be
done, as it has been done on occasion in the
past.

A party nomination for one of the men
who led in the Ring-tum Phi polls must, of
course be applauded. It is a recognition of
the freshmen’s preferences—and not merely
of certain pledge classes, but of the entire
freshman class. But even if two, or perhaps
three representative candidates are in the run-
ning, the fight will be far from won. After the
parties concede the freshman a voice in nom-
inating, there will still be the problem of the
tremendous pressure put on the freshmen to
vote the party choice.

The freshmen must vote their own judg-
ment, not their fraternity affiliation, if they
are to elect the best representative. But each
fraternity has at least one expert at “whipping
the boys into line,” and he will threaten the
freshmen with everything up to eternal dam.
nation unless they vote the party ticket. The
success the politicians have had in doing this is
astounding, in view of the fact that there is
nothing whi h can really force the freshmen
the ticket. The election is by secret
ballot. The threats of the politicians wouldn't
impress anybody but a freshman, because they
aren't credible—they lack substance.
Even a freshman will listen only the first time
he hears the spiel.

hope the freshman will treat this election with

the respect it deserves, not as the Clique will
treat it—one more place to be filled on the
gravy train. We hope the freshmen will vote
their consciences.

We Should Have Known Better

This campus has seen the passing of what
was one of the greatest campus political ma-
chines here in decades. Casualties by way of
graduation, transfers, and loss of interest have
completely broken up the organization which
elected two student body presidents and num-
erous lower officers in its brief but guady ca-
reer. Last year the organization’s demise be-
came assured when the old Progressive Party
hit the rocks and a new party was formed,
largely under the impetus of sophomores. The
new Liberty Party, controlled by these rela-
tive newcomers to politics, has its first out-
ing next week. It has some big shoes to fill.

The big question in campus politics now
is this: Will the new party organization be
able to work together efficiently enough to
fill the vacuum left by the passing of The
Organization which ruled for the last few
years? Will it, perhaps, become another Uni-
versity Party, a campus mammoth which may
settle down and control student elections for
several decades? The approaching freshman
EC election is the first test of strength for the
new party. On paper it looks like a champ; it
has about a two-to-one majority over the weak-
ened Progressives, one-time inheritors of the
old University Party mantle. But funny things
can happen in that secret ballot voting. What
is important to remember is that the Liberty
Party MUST win this election and win it
big—as big as its majority—or else fall apart.

Not only is this first election crucial
the test flight of Liberty Party cohesiveness;
it is also critical for the new party because it
needs this office “in the bank” as a reserve,
a victory to which it can point, because it
faces the odd fact that the Progressive Party,
although only half the size of the Liberty,
owns over two-thirds of next year’s recognized
potential student body officers. The Progres-
sive Party now contains the president, vice
president and both EC members of the rising
senior class. Thus the ten-house party, fan-
tastically enough, stands too take a real beat-
ing in spring student body voting, and if the
party makes a bad showing next week.
the chances of surviving these successive dis-
asters would be remote.

So the stakes next week for the Liberty
Party are high. But assuming that the Liber-
ty Party gets past this first test, how will it get
around the obstacle of a shortage of strong
candidates next spring? At this point in the
year it is really hard to see what can keep
such a party together; it has too many houses
and too few candidates. The last three years
here have been very liquid as far as party
makeup is concerned. This year looks like
still another year of flux.

Lo, the Poor Cadets

With Openings just around the corner, a
sense of human decency urges us to speak
out in behalf of our long-suffering neighbors,
the Veemies. Last year the cadets weren't al-
lowed to drink alcoholic beverages, and this
year their administration has come up with
the perhaps equally dampening rule that
cadets may not enter fraternity houses. Neith-
er one of these rules is fair to a man old
enough and sufficiently mature to be a college
student.

It was at the end of last year that cadets
were excluded from houses by their own ad-
ministration, due to several small ruckuses
between cadets and students. Since then the
Interfraternity Council has gone on record as
favoring the return of cadets to fraternities,
but by invitation only. This is the arrange-
ment which should have been in effect all
along, and seems to be a mutually agreeable
arrangement. However, no acceptance of this
idea has some from VMI

It is ridiculous to think that if a student
has a good friend at VMI, he cannot invite
the cadet to his fraternity house. General
Shell's restrictions have cut off the only real
means of intercourse between the two schools.
There is almost no other time besides week-
ends when cadets and students can meet, and
there are certainly no places in Lexington
other than fraternity houses where they are
very likely to meet and get to know each
other. The Ring-tum Phi urges General Shell
to take fraternity houses off the
list tor cadets.

“off-limits”

By LAMAR LAMB

In the current Presidential cam-
paign, there has been a great deal
of talk using such
terms as “Peace”
and “National
Strength. The Re-
publican nominees
have charged that
Democrats will
lead us into war
through weakness,
that we should
maintain peace
through strength.
The Democrats, on
the other hand,
have claimed that the Republican
party is irresponsible and will cer-
tainly lead us into war.

In this campaign, neither side has
really come to grips with the actual
disagreement. Both parties have long
argued on what is essentially two
different planes. In the first place,
most Americans could probably
agree with Senator Goldwater that}
a weak United States would almost
certainly be a short-lived one. A
weak America could be forced into}
a bloodless capitulation or be wiped!
off the map.

But President Johnson also has

weakness could lead to war, we must
also point out that he is wrong in
his assertion that the present Ad-
ministration has followed a_ policy
of weakness and accommodation.

Goldwater is wrong when he
says that the essential issue is
between ‘strength’ and ‘weakness.’
The central issue in this campaign
is whether the United States would
follow an essentially diplomatic or
an essentially militaristic policy in
its foreign relations.

President Johnson’s position is
basically sound. We must maintain
America’s strength. We must keep
up in development of new weapons,
and in conventional warfare poten-
tial. But we must be always willing
to negotiate. We must be willing to
deal with the Soviet Union, in
strength, not weakness, where we
can find legitimate areas of mutual
concern and can share mutual bene-
fi.t

It certainly would be to the ad-
vantage of both East and West to
seek ways of mutual survival. Sen-
ator Goldwater, though, has decided
he just dosen’t like Communists, and
is going to get rid of them. Un-
fortunately, when he tries we will
all go with him.

It is naive and the most danger-

believe that the world can be pre-
served by constant threats of war,

Soviet Union, or a policy of “liber-

ation” of Eastern Europe. Certainly

it states that the Federal government
has the authority to tell a citizen

lie accommodations. Do we have the
right to hire whom we please and
to allow those whom we please upon

Diplomacy vs. Militarism Choice

we should maintain a strong Amer-
ica; but we should remember that
to maintain any America, we will
have to have a measure of tolerance
and willingness to negotiate with
those who oppose us.

We notice, by the way, that last
Saturday Senator Goldwater came
out four-square on that old election
issue, God. He acknowledged his
support for an amendment to the
constitution which would allow
public school prayers. He asked, “Is
this the time...for our federal
government to ban God Almightly
from school rooms?” Not only have
the Democrats unfairly kept God
out of the school, he continued, but
their silence on the Prayer Amend-
ment showed their “utter disregard
of God.”

While sinful Lyndon is disre-
garding the sort of God who can
be banned from school rooms, holy
Barry has disregarded most o fthe
established religious community in
the United States. Almost every
national religious group, from the
Jews to the Baptists, has round-
ly criticized the Prayer Amend-
ment which Senator Goldwater
favors so much.

Most Americans, Christians and
non-Christians alike, are solidly in
favor of the separation of church
and state, and support the recent
Supreme Court decision on the mat-
ter, but not Senator Goldwater.
Apparently this is one pursuit of lib-
erty which is a vice.

to Johnny Keane, the manager of the St. Louis Cardinals,
for having the nerve to predict in the middle of August the
Cardinals would win the National League Pennant. At that
time the Cardinals were eight or nine games off first place set
by the Philadelphia Phillies, and sports fans just took his
prediction with a grain of salt.

to Joe Lyles for developing such a fine soccer team this
year despite the facts that his leading scorer and his outstand-
ing goalie graduated and that several of his top reserves de-
clined to play this season.

to Dave Redmond, Pete Preston, Howard Busse for the
excellent jobs they are doing in keeping the oppositions’ shots
on the Generals’ goal at a minimum.

to Bob Larus for the excellent job of goal tending he is
doing, much to the surprise of many. Larus has been a major
reason for the soccer team’s undefeated record.

to Dick Miller for the superior job he does as wrestling
and cross-country coach and, last but not least, equipment
manager for the entire athletic department. His job as equip-
ment manager is totally thankless, but he completes it with
high efficiency, although he often incurs the wrath of coaches
and athletes alike.

Bridgewater's Ron Tilgner tossed a 33-yard scoring strike
to his quick wingback Larry Crabhill to upset Washington
and Lee’s freshmen, 7-0, last Friday, for the Generals’ second
consecutive setback. It was merely a case of sluggish offense
which spelled disaster for W&L as the locals could manage

only 71 yards on the ground and seven through the air.

savage attack, the Bridgewater

passing combination of

By JAMES CROTHERS

t’s too bad losing teams don’t get
All-Americans. Because if the Gen-
erals could have won all or even
all but one of their contests, they
would have two strong contenders
for the post-season honors in pas-
sers Larry Craig and receiver Bill
David.

Craig and David have connected
for 21 completions for 213 yards. At
this pace, after only three of nine
games completed, both have good
chances for school and CAC rec-
ords. This is not to say that the
rest of the team is unworthy of
mention, but it is rare to find a team
with a 1-2 record and such an out-
standing passing attack.

David Remains Key Receiver

Craig also throws to end Tersh
Baker and this combination has been
good for 7 completions for 71 yards.
Halfback David remains, however,
as the key receiver. Last year, even
when the Generals did not have
to rely on the aerials, David caught
enough passes to rank him among
the leaders in the state and led the
CAC in this department.

In other statistics that might be in-
eresting to the general public, full-
back John Anthony, although sty-
mied in the Centre game, now leads
the team in the rushing department
with 123 yards gained in 27 tries

 

General Air Attack Paces Team
Craig, David Combination Clicks

PRIA IAA A

for a very impressive average of 4.6
yards per carry. With several good
games on this brusing fullback’s
part, Anthony could conceivably
win the CAC rushing title.

It seems impossible that the Gen-
erals are throwing the pigskin as

* | usually

 

much as they are. (It also seems
impossible that we're throwing the|
games away as much as we are,!
but...) Anyway Washington and}
Lee has taken to the air 59 times in|
three games and has completed 29
of these attempts. Craig is now 29
for 56 in the air—a very respectable
average—with only one interception,
while this virtual “rookie” has
| amassed 289 yards via passes.
Watch the Passes This Week

And...if you think W&L threw
the football the first three games of
the year, watch Saturday's contest
With the running attack gaining only
45 yards against Centre, it's a good
bet the Generals won't find much
more running room versus the Sus-
quehanna (Oh, my God) Crusaders.
Therefore, the home team will be
forced to pass, and maybe, find a
weak (7?) spot in SU's defense.

For this reason—W&L’s passing
times Baker—it is possible that the
Generals might not do as badly as
everyone (including the football
team, itself) thinks. Like the man
| said “Anything's possible.”

 

Centre Tops Generals, 8-0
In First CAC Performance

Washington and Lee saw their hopes for contention in the
CAC standings dashed by a determined Centre College squad,
8-0. The Generals failed to dominate Saturday’s game on the
ground as they had done the previous two outings.

Indeed, W&L gained only

a net total of 4 yards rushing.

However, the General passing game again exceeded 100 yards

 

Soccer Figures
Credit Defense

In recently released soccer sta-
tistics, the reasons for the booters
undefeated string become evident. In
the first four games, W&L has
given up only three goals while
scoring eleven.

Goalie Bob Larus has been the
stalwart of the General defense
compiling a total of 25 saves. Co-
captain Pete Preston and his full-
back companion Dave Redman have
also done outstanding jobs on de-
fense with 18 and 17 saves respec-
tively.

Although the scoring statistics are
very important, this year
the booters have relied on a stringent
defense. However, in the scoring de-
partment, Tim Henry leads the team
with six points (4 goals and 2 as-
sists), while Dave Kirkpatrick is
close behind him with 4 points (2
goals and 2 assists) .

As of now Washington and Lee

*with Larry Craig completing 14 of
27 attempts. Another so-called
vital statistic proved false as W&L
gathered 13 first downs to Centre’s
six.

Centre scores Long TD

The Colonel’s first and only score
came with Centre punting deep into
W&L territory. Centre blocked a
quick-kick attempt by John An-
thony and recovered the ball just
seven yards short of the end zone.
In two short plunges the Colonels
scored against W&L’s defensive
“Hungry Dogs.”

The Generals spent the remainder
of the game making short frustrat-
ing drives in a vain attempt to come
from behind. Early in the second-
half, W&L lost the services of An-
thony their leading ground gainer,
along with co-captain Tom Cren-
shaw and Skip Chase.

With 10:53 remaining in the fourth
quarter the Generals obtained pos-
session on their own 30-yard line
and started their most serious threat

of the day. Using short passes to
his ends, Craig moved W&L to the
Centre seven-yard line. A_ short
plunge, an incomplete pass and a
fumble left the Generals nine yards
short of the goal with only one down
and 2:53 left in the game.

Last Minute Passes Fail

With a Homecoming crowd of over
4,000 on the edge of their seats
quarterback Craig dropped back
and fired to his favorite receiver
Bill David only to have his pass
knocked down by a Centre defender.

The Generals’ defense held the
Colonels as it has held its previous
opponents and W&L regained pos-
session with only 53 seconds left
in the game. These final moments
were spent in futile long passes and
some more successful short ones.

Nine Fraternities Sever Party Connection

By HOWARD EPSTEIN
Yellow Journalist

In an effort to destroy the clique
system employed in W&L politics,
nine fraternities have broken from
their former political parties, to form
independent units.

Specifically, these houses will stay
aloof from the upcoming freshmen
EC election and allow the freshmen
in their respective pledge classes to
vote according to each individual’s
personal choice. This system differs
greatly from the Party System
where each pledge class is told to
vote for the party’s candidate, for
the party’s benefit, and therefore for
the betterment of the fraternity’s
interest in the party.

After the now-defunct Progressive
Party’s clique meeting broke up
early Tuesday morning, the new
University Party (not to be confused
with last year’s University Party)
leaped into being and opened its
first clique meeting. Ironically, sev-
eral clique representatives who had
just returned from picking an EC
nominee for the Progressive Party,
were hustled into a new meeting of
a new party composed of a new
alignment of fraternities to choose a
new nominee for the EC post.

 

As a result of these recent altera-
tions of campus party structure, as
the Friday edition goes to press
(3:30 p.m.), the University Party is
composed of nine houses: SAE, Delt,
Phi Gam, PiKA, Phi Delt, SPE,
Kappa Sig, KA, and Beta.

The remaining nine fraternities,
Phi Kap, ZBT, Phi Psi, Phi Ep,
Lambda Chi, Sigma Chi, DU, Phi
Phi, Pi Phi, Sigma Nu, and the
Independent Union, met Tuesday
evening and agreed not to form an
opposing party. They did select a
committee to investigate the possi-
bility of introducing a more demo-
cratic nominating procedure to W&L.
This committee is headed by Lamar
Lamb, and is composed of Bill Can-
non, Warren Montgomery, Jean
Friedberg, Shannon Jung, Bob Lee,
and Earl Magdovitz.

There are ten unaffiliated political
bodies now on campus and each

one of them is free to put forth its| ’

own candidate. This condition may
force several ballots since the Uni-
versity Constitution stipulates that
the candidates for EC positions must
receive a majority of the votes of
the class. If on the first ballot no

 

single candidate gains a majority,

 

the voting will continue with the
lesser vote-getters omitted.

As of Friday morning, there are
five announced candidates. Richard
Nash, a Beta Pledge, is the Uni-
versity Party clique’s choice. The

other four candidates are running) |
independently of party affiliation. |

EC Selects —
Monday at 7

For Electica |

In Tuesday night's Executive Com-
mittee meeting places, and times
were selected for the upcoming
freshman and law freshman class
EC elections.

The freshman class election will
take place in the Commons Monday
night at 7:30, and the law freshman
class election will be in the South
Room of Tucker Hall, also at 7:30.

All freshmen to be nominated for
the EC post are asked to meet with
student body president Jim Kulp
in the Commons at 6:30 on Tuesday. |

A simple majority will be required
to win, and if no candidate receives
a majority, there will be a runoff
scheduled between the two eandi-
dates receiving the largest number
of votes.

Freshmen on authorized school
business will be allowed to vote by
absentee ballot. In order for the
absentee ballot to be counted, it
must state the nature of school
business that the freshman will be
away on and be signed by him and
witnessed by two other members
of the student body. Students vot-
ing by absentee ballots can send
them to the election by other
freshmen .

Ballots will be counted after the
elections and the results will be
announced and posted in the Student
Union.

The EC also decided to join with
seven area colleges in publishing
an intercollegiate calendar of events
of the various colleges.

Mike Nation, a sophomore, appear-
ed before the BC and asked their
consideration of a proposal to re-
vamp student elections. The change
would have to be made through 4
constitutional amendment which can
be proposed by the EC or by a pe-
tition of fifty students.

Nation’s proposal called for a sys-
tem of open primaries to select stu-
dent body and class officers. The
purpose of the proposal is to make
student elections more democratic.

 

Nation stressed that the plan could
be revised considerably but streased
that student body elections should
he more democratic. The EC ques-

, tioned him on his plan and then)

agreed to give the plan detailed con. |

ideration and study.

After last week’s busy agenda,
the IFC settled down Monday night.
It appears to this columnist that this

has decided upon another unique)

Openings kicks off the first of four
major dance sets for the 1964-65
year.

The Dance Board has selected this
year’s entertainment on the _ basis
of a student poll conducted last
spring. The Shirelles, James Brown,

the Duo-Tones, and the Saints and
Sinners Band head the list of en-

tertainers for the weekend. Meshed
in between the musical array of

talent will be a football game that| ~

matches one of the most talented
small college teams in the nation—
Susquehanna—against W&L's Five
Star Generals.

The Weekend will officially get
underway Friday afternoon at 4:00
p.m. when Bill Jeffress, President
of Openings, is honored at a cock-
tail party featuring the Duo-Tones.
The party is at the Moose Lodge
and will last until 6:00 p.m.

The Duo-Tones will replace Dr.
Feelgood and the Interns who had
originally been scheduled to per-
form. The group has recently reach-
ed national prominence with its hit,
“Baby Shake a Tailfeather.”

The Shirelles will appear at the
Openings Dance Friday night at 9:00
pm. For the first time Washington
and Lee students will not be re-
quired to wear tuxedoes to the
dance; instead Dance Board Presi-
dent Steve Hibbard asks that all
students wear suits.

The Shirelles have recorded over a
dozen gold records, including “Mama

This Is A Free Election

Current political parties at W&L have had very short-
lived histories. The recent demise of yet another party, the
Liberty Party, is just another in a long line of witnesses to this
fact. At the time of its founding just last spring, a statement
was made by the newly founded party which stated that:

“We wish it understood that the members of this
party are bound solidly together in this effort, and that
appeasement will take no precedence in our decisions.”

However solidly they may once have been bound together,
the fact remains that the Liberty Party existed through no
election period. This is, however, only one example of the
instability that seems to plague political parties on this campus.

In nominating representatives for campus office, the parties
have in the past held nominating caucuses or “‘clique meetings.”
Two or three men from each house have gotten together
and have nominated their various fraternity brothers for the
office. After presenting his qualifications, a vote has been
taken by all members of the clique, and the candidates for
whom the majority of clique representatives vote has been
nominated. Once again this year the same political machinery
has been rolled out, a candidate nominated, a disgruntled
element has split with the rest of the party, and a new party
using the same antiquated machinery has been assembled.

It is, therefore, evident that the eighteen men (two clique
representatives from each house) who represented the new
University Party felt that Richard Nash was the freshman’s
choice and therefore nominated him. It may be that the fresh-
men enjoy having upperclassmen nominate one of the candi-
dates who seeks to represent them on the EC. It may be that
they appreciate having the responsibility (or privilege) of
selecting a man from among themeselves taken over by the
upperclassmen. Why it is not possible for college freshmen
to have enough discretion to select and nominate their own
candidate is beyond us. Surely it seems that freshmen, not
upperclassmen, should nominate and elect their own repre-
sentative.

Many of those freshmen who are pledges of houses in the
University Party will be told that it helps their house if they
vote for, and elect, the party’s candidate. Maybe . . . However,
those in the party today may not be in the same party tomor-
row. The instability of the present system could easily result
in yet another realignment within a few days or weeks, at any
rate, before the next election.

This political “sound and fury” may last a week,
but it will only last a week. The student government
must function throughout the year. It is, therefore, evi-
dent that the choice of the man, and not the mandate of
the party, is of more importance in the long run.

If you feel that you must appease the party, however, there
is an alternative open to you. You may listen to the instruc-
tion on why you should vote for your party’s candidate, and
you may seem to acquiesce, but the voting is by secret ballot.
No one need know that you voted for the man of your choice;
this is a free election.

This editorial is not directed against Richard Nash, or any
other man that has run for a party. Richard Nash is not, simply
because he is running for a party, marked as the upperclass-
man’s choice and not the freshman’s.

This editorial is designed to say only one thing to
freshmen: Don’t let the party, the fraternity, or the lack
of party usurp your inalienable right—the right to vote
for the man of your choice.

Openings, 1964 Style

Autumn is here, and so is Openings.

 

They come every year, and each leaves its mark upon the}

community. Autum leaves Lexington cold, and covered with
leaves. Openings leaves Lexington with numerous broken
windows, bottles, heads and hearts.

The number of fines, parking tickets, and arrests which |

the ever alert Lexington police force will issue this weekend
will stagger your imagination. The bank balance of the town
will rise tremendously due to this college windfall. It happens
every year.

However, Openings 1964, will be different in many re-
spects from those of the past. For the first time in years, Open-
ings Dance will not require tuxedos. This fact alone should as-
sure a good crowd at the dance, something that has not held
true in the past. Whoever is responsible for this change should
be congratulated.

Congratulations should also be extended to the Dance
Board, and its president, Steve Hibbard. Together they have
provided Washington and Lee with a line-up of truly great
performers. The Shirelles and James Brown are guaranteed
to put on a good show. A show that will be remembered for
a number of years. Add in the cocktail party, and the fraternity
parties, and you will have a weekend that should top that of
any other college or university.

Saturday's football game with Susquehanna should also
be interesting. Not only will W&L’s record of home victories
be at stake, but also the safety of the team. Susquehanna is
big, and has averaged 400 yerds per game. Statistics are not
all, however. Win or lose, it will be a game to remember.

Date or no date, drunk or sober this should be one hell of

a weekend. —L. N. M.

 

Free Choice Trampled By Big Clique

By MALCOLM MORRIS

Last Tuesday’s pre-dawn party
realignment is perhaps the most
blatant effort yet by a group of
fraternities to exercise political dom-
ination at the expense of responsibil-
ity and free choice at W&L. This
group of houses, or rather political
bosses, is unequaled in the obvious-
ness with which they have rejected
any concept of a student’s voice in
his government or any idea that a
candidate be respected or highly
qualified. In no previous party
switch have the supposedly reassur-
ing promises of the new clique
sounded quite so hollow or seemed
so absolutely and unbeliveably ludi-
crous.

The new University Party, alias
the “big clique,’ has seemed to
base their move on one of two
assumptions. They figure the Stu-
dent Body as big enough suckers
to follow along without protest, or
they feel they are strong enough
to tell the rest of the Student Body
to take a long walk and just leave
the details of the student elections
up to the wise and all-powerful
political bosses. This whole political
change would be a complete joke
worthy of a carnival if it did not
in fact endanger our most valuable
tradition, the honor system,

Cliques

Political cliques can pass around
the class officers without any con-
cern for qualification, and it doesn’t
hurt anyone simply because those
officers don’t mean anything. How-
ever, when party cliques disregard
qualifications, responsibility, and re-
spect in their nomination of Execu-
tive Committee members, they pose a
real threat to the preservation of
our honor system.

The honor system rests squarely
upon the faith which each student
must have in the responsibility and
judgment of his elected representa-
tives on the Executive Committee.
These positions carry not just pres-
tige but an awesome responsibility.
An EC position is not to be held by
the pledge just because his fraternity
clique man wheels and deals the
best.

This position is not to be held by
a pledge just because his party clique
man has gathered together a party
built on the hunger to dominate and
not to nominate. This position is not
to be held by a pledge just because
his fraternity has no BC member and
its campus prestige demands one,
ie, a man from one of the “stud”
houses, sent to rule over the cam-
pus lizards.

Overwhelming Choice
Certainly the University Party was
formed only to grab complete con-
trol of the student government
without any regard to the respon-

sibility which should accompany
power. What other reasons can any
of the party clique chairmen give
for their realignment. These politi-
cians can’t say they left the Liber-
ty Party because it was not operat-
ing fairly or didn’t nominate a
highly qualified man. The Liberty
Party chose a man who was the
overwhelming choice of his class-
mates in a preferential poll. This
man was highly qualified by a fine
school record.

In fact, he was the choice of most
of the clique men at a Sunday night
meeting, even of several of the
houses now in the University Party
supporting Nash.

 

It seems hard to explain how at

least two houses suddenly changed
their minds on the best qualified
man,

The new party can’t be said to be a
result of doublecrosses or the break-
ing of party lines. There was no
election in which this could have
happened. The Liberty Party was
certainly as harmonious as any ten
clique men could have made it.

There seems to be but one con-
clusion left for the formation of the
University Party. This party seems
to have been formed solely and
blatantly for the purpose of depriv-
ing W&L of a student government
with the best representatives and
with a base broader than nine
fraternity clique men.

 

Already six out of eight fraterni-
ty members of the EC represent
houses in the University Party. The
election of Richard Nash would
make it seven out of nine. If the
freshmen who are pledged to the
big clique houses allow their clique
men to vote for them, they may end
up with more power and another
victory for their party. However,
they may also end up with a week-
ened student government and a
dead honor system.

Is it really possible that here at
W&L, 1200 men are to be controlled
by nine clique men of such obvious
irresponsibility and disregard for
any such foolish ideas as qualifica-
tion, respect, or free choice?

were except for a couple of excep-

never made it through an election.
Now there are loud cries from the

I would not be one to defend the
party switches, alignments, re-align-
ments, and new parties that have
occurred since my freshman year—
with few exceptions—but I see no
good in the attacks being made
(many of them unjust) that can only
result in ill-feeling among houses
and among members of houses.

W&L politics has always been a
game played by the clique repre-
sentatives and will probably always
be such a game. Every house wants
political offices to use as rushing
‘capital’ and I dare say that not
one of the houses that are now
‘independent’ would have turned
down an invitation to join the new
University Party. Perhaps, there is
one—the Sigma Chi’s—who decided

 

Big Clique Domination Refuted

last spring to become and remain
independent.

Perhaps, I am being non-idealist,
but I fail to see where party poli-
tics has hurt the campus. Sure the
parties pass out offices, especially
the smaller class offices, but I per-
sonally think that this is good in
that it gives a wide cross-section
of fraternity representation among
the offices. And, when it comes to
the executive committee members
the parties must nominate qualified
men because party ties and straight
party voting simply doesn’t hold at
this level.

In fact, an examination of last
spring's elections would seem to in-
dicate that a majority party can't
even hold its members at the level
of class elections if they don’t put
up the best qualified candidates.
Prior to last spring's student body
elections, the Delis and SPE’s
switched to the University Party
making an eleven-seven split with
the University Party in the majority.

Indecision And hao Of Face
Attend Speaking Tradition

By BRUCE W. RIDER

As all mothers of Washington and
Lee students know, there is some-|
thing on our fair campus known as
the Speaking Tradition.

At least once each year some hot-|
head scribbles a letter to the editor)
of the Ring-tum Phi stating that all
our traditions are not traditions at
all and who needs them anyway. |

And immediately a group of nine-|
teen-year-old reactionaries rises up)
to defend the hallowed practices of|
the University.

Unfortunately, all of these people
miss the point.

The problem isn't what should we
do with the Speaking Tradition but
rather what the devil do you say and |
do when being Speakingly Tradi-
tional’

The scene: you are coming up the
walk te the campus. In the misty
distance another student approaches.
Will he speak? Who should speak
first? How close should get before
speaking? It's like a gun duel at high
noon in Dodge City and someone

forgot to tell you which man is
Marshal! Dillon

There is also a loss of face in-
volved if one is not careful. Some
few students, miniscule minority

though they may be (and contrary |
to the spirit of the Alumni Maga-|
zine) do not speak at all. Thus you
must be able to judge whether or

nored. If this happens too frequently
you begin to wonder if you are in-
visible.

But let's get to the central question

| concerning the Speaking Tradition:

what to say.

Should your greeting be a big
friendly “good afternoon, fellow stu-
dent, it is indeed nice to see you

| on this lovely day,” or a briefer “hi,

Bub"? And what do you say to a
whole group of students walking to-
gether? It takes considerable skill
to say the proper thing to the prop-
er persons at the proper time.

And lurking behind all of this is
the awesome and majestic Assimila-
tion Committee. Suppose you neglect
to speak, or to provide a hearty
enough hello? A little white card
with your name on it will be placed
in a little brown box in the big Com-
mons. And who among us has ever
emerged unseathed from the ordeals
of a Student Commitiee?

We must remember that a sense
of duty is involved with Speaking
Traditionaliy. Who is so cruel as to
not speak to a bright-evyed fresh-
man (a member of the best quali-
fled. highest College Boarded class
ever to enter W&L) or to a kindly
professor or to an open-shirted tour-
bat?

Perhaps the solution to all of our
Speaking problems lies in having all
students wea:

 

signs similar to the
not a man will return your greeting| {freshman name tags which would
before you hazard a hello. It's most! bear a personal greeting to one and

embarrassing to speak and to be ig-| all.

Crusaders Favor

W&L At Home Against epee

Generals Depend on Passing Game ;

{
¥

BY GUY UNANGST

Washington and Lee Univ

game on its home Wilson field since early November of 1959.
Tomorrow the Generals play Susquehanna University, ranked
seventh nationally by the Associated Press small college poll,
and their streak will probably end abruptly.

Susquehanna’s Crusaders, o
ly riding a 12-game win string, and*
have lost only one of their last 35
games. Four of the victories have
come this year, including a 42-0 ver-
dict against Randolph-Macon, which
defeated W&L, 8-0.

The last time the Generals lost
here was when another bunch of
Pennsylvanians, from Carnegie Tech,
beat them, 20-16. There was a tie
with Johns Hopkins in 1960, but
W&L has won all 15 since.

Susquehanna brings a team aver-
aging 403.3 yards total offense and
34 points a game, and W&L coach
Lee McLaughlin rates them the best
to play here since Wittenberg, cur-
rently No. 1 among small colleges
mauled the Generals, 61-26 in 1957.

Although the Crusaders have
given up only 30 rushing yards a
game, their passing defense has
sometimes been lax, and this is
where McLaughlin hopes to strike.
Juniata, in losing, 36-17, last Sat-
urday, completed 19 of 33 passes
against Susquehanna.

“Our pass defense was very bad,
even though we spent a lot of time
on it during the previous week,”
Crusaders coach Jim Garrett said.
“We have a veteran team with eight
seniors in the starting lineup and
we shouldn't be making so many
fundamental mistakes.”

Said opposing coach McLaughlin,
“We threw 27 passes last week
against Centre and we'll throw as
many as we did then—more prob-
ably.”

W&L's main problems will be
getting the ball. Against Juniata,
Susquehanna halfbacks Larry Erd-
man and John Vignone and full-
back Bill Galbraith combined for
361 yards on the ground. In all,
Susquehanna gained 425 yards, all!
rushing.

The Crusaders’ offense is typified
by a drive two weekends ago against
Marietta. Using 19 consecutive rush-
ing plays, they marched 70 yards in
10 and one-half minutes to score
their final touchdown of a 36-19 win
with three seconds left.

Erdman, Vignone and Galbraith
share the load with Gilbraith car-
rying when Susquehanna nears a
touchdown. The short (5’ 8”), 195-
pound senior has already scored
ten touchdowns.

The Crusaders are big, with ten
linemen weighing more than 200
pounds. Bill Muir, a 230-pounder,
is the largest, and heads a strong
contingent at his position.

Susquehanna won last year’s game,
the first in the series, 31-0.

Saturday either W&L’s string of

Wilson Field wins or Susquehanna’s| —_

unbeaten streak will be broken.
Chances are W&L will end up on
the short end in the first of four
consecutive home games .

they have

offense has been good for a 160-yard

In talking about basketball and|
Washington and Lee, Canfield said,
“I plan to make basketball a recog-

one to be patient and not expect
great changes overnight.” He added,
“I think you will see a marked dif-
ference in the attitude of the play-|
ers this year.”

While noting that official basket-
ball practice won't start until Mon-
day, Canfield pointed out that “many
players have already been work-
ing out on their own for a week
now.” He pointed to this as evidence
of increased interest this year.

Canfield said this year’s schedule
calls for a 16 game slate with next
year’s schedule being longer. That
schedule calls for a 26 game season
and features trips to Florida and
Kentucky.

LM Finals Start
= Football, Wrestling Seasons Next

By JOHN BEAGLE

Golf ended Tuesday afternoon
with three league champs decided
and with the fourth league ending
in a three-way tie for the top spot.

Phi Delt won League A and is
favored to capture the champion-
ship. Sigma Chi looms as the top
threat for Phi Delt as they took
the top spot in League B.

Winner in League C was ZBT
while League D had a _ two-way
tie between Sigma Nu and Delt
which will be played off before the
finals start.

Tennis ended last Friday as Beta!
successfully defended its league title)
in League A. SAE upset Phi Kap|
in a close 3-2 match to take the
honors in League B.

In League C, another three-awy
tie occurred between Phi Delt, ZBT,
and PEP. However, PEP gained the
finals by defeating ZBT after the
Zebes had first upended Phi Delt.
KA, as predicted, won the title in
League D. In the finals PEP has the
edge, but KA looks like the main
threat with SAE rating as the dark-
horse. Beta should finish fourth.

Football started Wednesday and
last year’s league champs in B and
C got off to fast starts.

Last year’s second place finishers,
the Law School trounced Phi Delt,
24-0. The Law School looked good
on both defense and offense. SPE,
which finished third last year, de-
feated Kappa Sig, 30-14, in a wide-
open offensive game. Beta and Sig-
ma Nu had their game postponed be-
cause of the World Series.

This year in I1-M football, an All-
Star team will be chosen at the end
of the season. The officials of the
games will be the main judges in
choosing the team. Leyburn Mos-
by is the head official for football
and will be in charge of choosing
the team.

U.Va. Frosh Defeat
Baby Booters, 5-2

Washington and Lee’s freshman
soccer team dropped its second game
in three starts Wednesday, losing to
the University of Virginia frosh by
a 5-2 margin on the Cavaliers’ home
field.

The Baby General booters got off
to a good start as Ralph Schenkel
connected early in the opening per-
iod for the first score of the game.

men proceeded to rack up all five|
of their goals before W&L got back
in the scoring column on Al Craig’s
fourth quarter kick.

Freshman coach Bob Lathrop con-
fessed after the game that he was
“disappointed” by his squad’s per-
formance. “I don’t think we played
jour best game at all,” he said. “I
think we have the material to look

much better than we did. In fact,
we proved that against Randolph-

 

~1|} Macon.”

 

The team’s next outing is set for
October 28 on the W&L field against
Augusta Military Academy. The Ca-
dets beat the Baby Generals 4-2
| in an earlier meeting, but the fresh-
|}men have gained a great deal of

experience since that contest and
| should do much better this time out,
according to Coach Lathrop.

, Injuries Dampen
& Generals’ Hopes

Injuries are the number one prob-

lem for Coach Lee McLaughlin and

the Washington and Lee Generals as
they prepare for tomorrow’s home
opener against Susquehanna at Wil-
son Field. Game time is set for two
o'clock.

One person is definitely lost for
tomorrow’s game while the playing
status of five more Generals is
doubtful.

Lost for tomorrow’s game and the
rest of the season is senior guard
Bo Earnest. Doubtful starters for
tomorrow’s game include the team’s
top ground gainer, junior fullback
John Anthony, and the team’s other
senior guard, Curt Jernigan.

Coach McLaughlin also reports
that the playing status of halfbacks
Tom Crenshaw, Skip Chase and
Harry Brookby is questionable.

In last year’s game between the
two Squads, Susquehanna snapped
the Generals nine game winning
streak with a 31-0 thrashing of

*W&L. The only team to have faced

both squads this season is Randolph-
Macon, and they beat W&L, 8-0,
while losing to the Crusaders, 42-0.

So far this season, the Generals
have been their own worst enemy.
Upset by Randolph-Macon in their
opener when they couldn’t captalize
on scoring opportunities, the Gen-
erals dropped their game last week-
end when Centre blocked a W&L
quick-kick near the General goal
line. That set up the Colonels for
the game’s only score.

The Generals offense this season

But U.Va.’s ability to control the | i. reminiscent o fthe 1957-50 era
ball soon told as the Wahoo fresh-| when the team took to the air in an

effort to develop its scoring punch.

Quarterback Larry Craig has al-
ready thrown more passes in three
games this season than any W&L
quarterback threw all last season.
With 29 completions, Craig needs
just four more to equal the Wash-
ington and Lee total for last season.

End Bill David, who was last sea-
son’s top pass receiver, has already
caught more passes than he did all
last season and has gained almost
as much yardage. During the entire
season last year, David caught but
20 passes for 222 yards. This year
he has already pulled in 21 passes
for 213 yards.

While conceding that the Craig-
to-David combination makes for ex-
citing action, Coach McLaughlin
points out that so far this season it
has added up to just one touchdown.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Saunders Supported By IU

Tuesday night the W&L Student
Body witnessed the collapse of the|
infant Liberty Party.

By this time it should be clear
to each freshman that this move was
NOT made in the interests of elect-
ing the most qualified candidate for
Executive Committee. This grand
coup d’etat was conceived and exe-
cuted under the banner of the “pat-
ronage rotation” system, the roots of
whie hare greed, the results of which
are bad. Indeed it is a fact that this
blatant disregard for the student
weal does not find its origin in the
formation of the University Party,
but rather has been a prominent
characteristic of campus parties in
recent years.

Recognizing this disregard of
Freshman interests, the Independent
Union on Thursday night adopted
a resolution: The political system,
as it now stands is not in the interest
of the student body and must be
drastically changed. Because the IU.
acknowledges that the victory of the
University Party in this election
would only further entrench this
party cynicism, the I U. believes
that the University Party must be
defeated.

After carefully considering the
qualifications of each of the four ma-
jor candidates, and after listening
to statements by each, the Indepen-
dent Union officially endorses Steve
Saunders its candidate in the
belief that he will actively work for

as

 

the restablishment of the parties
along lines of individual member-|
ship. The qualifications of Steve |
Saunders are far too numerous to|
mention here. Suffice to say that a

In order to obtain the maximum
welfare from these proposals (and
from the government), they should
be effected by next semester. Of
course, there are always those who
perniciously insist on adhering to
tried and proven ways; however,
no progressive person can deny that
all old ideas are outmoded and
malignant and must be replaced with
new ones immediately. These new
courses will do much for W&L in
the way of agrarian reform, but

 

they must be enacted by the faculty
NOW, before they become old

Weekend of Activities

Planned for Parents

The tenth annual Parents’ Weekend,
sponsored jointly by the Parents’ Ad-
visory Council and Washington and
Lee University, will take place here
on October 30 and 31 and November 1.

Invitations have been sent out to
all parents of W&L students and as of
yesterday 885 parents had registered
for the occasion. This number is al-
ready larger than the attendance at
last year’s weekend. A total of 185
guests have also accepted invitations
for the weekend.

Registration and Appointments

Parents’ weekend activities begin
on Friday afternoon and run through
Saturday night. The Friday program
begins with registration and includes
faculty appointments, which must be
made in advance by the students.
There will also be campus tours, a
meeting of the Parents’ Advisory
Council, and a weekly Chemitsry
Seminar on Friday afternoon.

Friday evening there will be a num-
ber of faculty-student programs, giv-
en in an attempt to provide a picture
of the diversity of the academic and
extracurricular programs at W&L.
These will be followed by a reception
held by President and Mrs. Cole in
Evans Hall.

Report to Parents

On Saturday time will again be set
aside for parent-faculty conferences,
and guided tours of the campus. At
eleven a.m. the “Report to Parents”
will be given in Doremus Gymnas-
jum. Speaking for this occasion will |
be Jim Kulp, president of the student
body; Dr. William Pusey, Dean of the
College; Dr. Fred C. Cole, President of
the College, Dean Edward C. Atwood,
Jr., Dean of Students; and Dean James
D. Farrar, Director of Admissions.
Dean Lewis W. Adams of the School
of Commerce and Administration and
Dean Charles P. Light of the Law
School will also speak. The afternoon
will be taken up by a buffet luncheon
and a varsity football game against
Bridgewater. A Saturday night Glee
Club concert in the gymnasium will
officially mark the end of the well-
planned weekend of activity.

It is the expressed hope of the Coun-
cil and the University that the par-
ents and guests will, through their vis-
it, be able to develop a better under-
standing of Washington and Lee and/

FRESHMEN STOP CLIQUE

Nash And Saunders In Run-Off;
Heinzerling Is Law EC Winner

By FRANK L. FAIRCHILD, JR.
Staff Reporter
Failing to receive the needed 133 majority in last night’s
election, the University Party’s nominee, Richard Nash, and
an independent candidate, Steve Saunders, have gone into a

run-off for freshman EC.

The final count last night gave Nash 111 votes against
Saunder’s 83 votes. Placing third, Jody Kline, the Liberty

Party’s choice,
while John Reynolds, another inde-
pendent candidate, polled 31 votes.
The Nash-Saunders run-off was an-
nounced for Thursday

Law Elections

Also in campus elections last
night, the election of officers for
the freshman class of the Law
was held in Tucker Hall.
The final tally of votes gave John
Heinzerling a victory over Louis
MacNeace by a count of 26-21 in
the contest for freshman Law repre-
sentative on the Executive Commit-
tee.

Additional results showed that
Roscoe Reynolds was elected Presi-
dent of the freshman Law Class,
while Herbie Smith was selected
Vice-President and Joe Logan was
chosen Secretary-Treasurer.

Freshman Speeches

The freshman election took place
at 7:30 p.m. in Evans Dining Hall
last evening under the direction of
student body President Jim Kulp.
Each candidate, preceded by a brief
nominating speech, was allowed five
minutes to express his feelings re-
garding his personal intentions and
qualifications for the office of fresh-
man Executive Committeeman.

Tommy Baremore, speaking first,
nominated ZBT pledge Steve Saun-
ders for the office. Enumerating his
candidate's qualifications, Baremore
stated that Saunders has served as

| co-editor-in-chief of his high school

newspaper The Oracle, Chief Justice
| of his school’s student court, and
governor of the New York District
of Key Club International. He also
cited Saunders’ activities here at
W&L which include participation in
the Young Republicans, membership
in the U.C.A., and chairmanship of
the W&L Civil War Round Table.

Saunders’ Talk
Candidate Saunders emphasized
that he felt there were two main is-
sues in the election: (1) the degree
of qualification of the candidates,

| and (2) the political system of Wash-

ington and Lee. Verbally
ton Churchill's statement:
have so few fooled so many for so
long.”

lashing

“Never |

received 36 votes™

 

He emphasized his qualifica-_

tions and conclused by expressing a
desire to serve the freshman class as)

i

a member of the Executive Commit-_

tee Saunders placed third in the"

 

preferential poll conducted by the

editors of the Ring-tum Phi last
week.
Dave Doughtery nominated the

University Party’s Candidate Rich-
ard Nash. Listing the nominee’s
qualifications, Doughtery stated that
Nash was vice-president of his sen-
ior class in high school, a member
of the National Honor Society, and
a varsity football and baseball play-
er. At Washington and Lee, Nash
is president of his pledge class, a
member of the Dance Board Advis-
ory Committee, and a member of the
recently established Food Control
Committee. Dougherty further stated
that Nash’s entire campaign had
been organized by members of the
freshman class.

Richard Nash

Richard Nash, a Beta pledge, said
that the main issue of the campaign
was the sincerity and responsibility
of the individual aspirants. He en-
couraged the freshmen not to vote
for or against a political party, but
rather to consider the personal qual-
ifications of each candidate. Nash
placed fourth in the preferential poll.

Reaction to the election results
was mixed. Commenting on the out-
come, Richard Nash stated: “I would
like to thank everbody who voted
for me in this election. I urge all
those who voted for me this eve-
ning as well as those who didn’t, to

| vote for me in the run-off Thursday

morning.”
Adams Comments

Liberty Party spokesman Patton
Adams summarized his feelings re-
garding the results of the election.
“First, I think the election shows
that the new University Party isn’t
as united as it thought it would be.
Secondly, it re-inforces the fact that
the political system of this campus,
as it now stands, has to go through
a full re-evaluation to see if it really
is the best system. Thirdly, I think
it is an election in which fraternities
played a smaller part than usual.

“If you compare the campaigns of
Nash and Saunders, I think you
would have to say that freshmen had
a louder voice in this election. Per-
haps, this indicates a trend. This
may be a reaction against the type
of system, or against the new Party
and the underhanded, wornout way
in which it was formed.”

The First W&L Primary

In what was essentially a primary election
last night, the freshman class nominated two
men to run for the office of Freshman Execu-
tive Committeeman next Thursday: Richard
Nash, the Clique candidate, and Steve Saun-
ders, an independent.

The difference in backing between these
two candidates is the decisive factor in the
election. It is the difference between a nomina-
tion by party bosses and one by popular de-
mand. It is true that Saunders appears, on the
basis of his record, to be the better “qualified”
of the two men; and it is true that Saunders
has out-campaigned Nash and has done so on
his own—unlike Nash. Moreover, at least two
of the candidates who did not make the run-
off favor Saunders over Nash. But outweigh-
ing these factors is another: a vote for Nash
is a vote for domination by the Clique; a vote
for Saunders is a vote for a free primary sys-
tem by which the student body will finally be

able to nominate its own candidates.

There have already been pompous threats
from fraternities in attempts to force straight-
party voting. But pressure itself will probably
convince the freshmen not to let the Clique
dictate to them. If the movement which has
carried Saunders this far can elect him, it will
be a serious blow to party pettiness and cha-
canery. If this movement puts Saunders into
office, we believe that a man will have been
elected who is exceptionally competent and
eager to serve; and that Saunders will not be
another “disappearing” freshman EC repre-
sentative.

 

Ignoring The Issues

History was made in a frighteningly rapid
whirl last week. But as the world moved from
one major news event to another, Barry Gold-
water failed, as usual, to keep up. In the
Soviet Union two leaders relatively unknown
to the free world replaced Nikita Khrushchev,
a known quantity, who had led the Communist
world through a softening of east-west ten-
sions. In Great Britain, a weak Labor Party
took over from the Conservatives on a cam-
paign which promised to withdraw much coop-
eration from the U.S. in the defense of the
free world against Communists. And in Red
China an atomic device was detonated to un-
derline the threat posed by the Chinese.

Mr. Goldwater, however, had little to say
about all this. During his campaign he has
had little enough to say on foreign affairs,
but his failure to meet these latest questions is
especially disappointing. The Senator has of-
fered no answers, affords no reasons why the
American people should vote out an exper-
ienced leader and put into office a new one. We
could expect as outspoken a man as Mr. Gold-
water to point to last week’s events and show
exactly how he would have met each crisis; but
the Senator is surprisingly silent. President
Johnson, on the other hand, has given the
people every reason for continued confidence
in him in several statements on the recent
changes.

Perhaps Senator Goldwater is silent on
world affairs because he realizes that they
hurt his candidacy. If the Soviets have retired
Khrushchev at the behest of leaders who favor
more aggressive policies toward the west, as
seems likely, should this country take the bit
in its teeth and put Goldwater in office because
he too favors a more aggressive policy in in-
ternational relations? Our interests would be
much better served by sticking with the steady
Johnson-Kennedy policies. It would be sense-
less in this situation to imagine that peace
could be better preserved by a leader with
Goldwater's uncompromising attitudes than by
a man of Johnson's political genius.

The British changeover from Tory to
Labor government is a peculiarly unfriendly
one to Mr. Goldwater. Like all our European
allies, the British are strongly inclined against
Goldwater, and if he were elected he would
face terrific problems in establishing good re-
lations with the new Labor administration. Yet
this is precisely the time when we need a pres-
ident able to work closely with the British,
because of their increasing reluctance to join
in North Atlantic defense. Now is the time
for a firm hand on relations with England—
not the hand Senator Goldwater has shown us.

The explosion of a nuclear device by the

Red Chinese presents another problem which
Mr. Goldwater appears ill-equipped to handle:
as an atomic power, Red China will seem
even more qualified to be recognized in the
world diplomatic councils. But Mr. Goldwater
seems to be adhering (for once) to his strong
determination to have no dealings at all with
the Red Chinese. His comments on the re-
cent developments have been centered on the
evils of trade with the mainland Chinese,
which is hardly the basic question. The John-
son administration, though not ready to rec-
ognize the Red Chinese, has at least made
progress toward a framework for dealing with
them realistically.

Everywhere he has gone, the Republican
nominee has hammered on the theme of the
Bobby Baker scandal; it is reported that he
considers this his best campaign issue. So far,
Bobby Baker has indeed been his best issue.
But whether the voters will be convinced that
this is a more important issue than our rela-
tions with the Russians, British, and Chinese,
is doubtful. Mr. Goldwater has also spoken
forthrightly and effectively on some domestic
issues, but more than this has to come from a
presidential candidate. He must give evidence
of a certain ability to deal with a world situa-

tion of increasing complication and delicacy.,

Mr. Johnson has proved willing to face the
fact of this complication, this delicacy, and to
bear the burden of seeming often unwilling
to give the “right” answer to embarrassing
questions.

Senator Goldwater continues to give simple
answers which are not real solutions. He will
not, he says, deal with the Communists, he
will not tolerate increasing presidential pow-
er; he spoke out most notably last week in
favor of school prayers, “moral leadership,”
and freedom of association. His arguments ate
sometimes powerful ones, but the Senator is
ignoring the even more powerful considera-
tions of international relations. More and
more Mr. Goldwater convinces us that we must
place our confidence in Lyndon Johnson, who
has shown himself able to understand and to
deal with problems of an age which demands
a strong president and a skillful negogiator.

 

“Time For A Change”

With all the deans, assistant deans, asso-
ciate deans, and faculty members who play
handball, we could expect the handball courts
to be kept in the peak of condition. Some-
how, though, they are continually in a state
of disrepair which is more befitting the ruins
of Liberty Hall than handball courts which
are in almost constant use. Whereas the cam-
pus grass is raked over with a fine-tooth comb
and enough fences are placed around the lawn
to turn the campus into a labyrinth, the hand-
ball courts languish in neglect. If just a little
of all this effort were turned toward the courts,
the results would be more than gratifying to
the high percentage of students and elite
faculty members who play handball.

Handball is Washington and Lee’s own
peculiar “national sport,” played by everybody
from the President to aspiring faculty mem-
bers to student gym classes. This is just what
makes it so amazing to find holes in the walls,
piles of plaster in the corners, doors without
latches or handles, and faulty lighting. Things
are actually so bad that players often lose
handballs through the holes in the walls, or
are trapped inside the courts because the doors
have no handles for opening from the inside.
Perhaps these conditions are suffered because
somebody later collects the lost balls for resale.
But the howling which is put up by the typ-
ically infuriated trapped handball player
should become insufferable in time and per-
haps will soon drive the coaches to ask that
repairs be made.

Of course the most basic problem of the
handball courts 15 the same which dominates
Washington and Lee's entire athletic program:
we need new facilities. When (7?) the new
gym is built, hopefully many more handball
courts will be included in the plans; and hope-
fully the new courts will be kept in such con-
dition that they will not become a menace to
the life and limb of their users. Meanwhile,
the Ring-tum Phi urges that action be taken
promptly to prevent the present handball
courts from falling into disuse because of ne
glect. We have one fine ruin already, Liberty
Hall; we don't need any more.

 

Gee! At this rate I'll have 52% by next July!

 

Mystery

Over Khrushchev’s Fall

Brings Varying Interpretations

By GARETH ADEN

“Mister K ... he dead.”
Joseph Conrad
Heart of Darkness

No one around here seems to
know where ex-premier Nikita
Khrushchev is, but everyone is will-
ing to make predictions about the
coup last week.

One thing is for sure, the change
in the Russian government took the
whole world by surprise. At first
it was not clear whether Khrush-
chev had retired or had been forced
out of office, as the official statement
claimed. He had spoken of retiring
before and the man that was official-
ly to succeed him as first party sec-
retary was his hand-picked succes-
sor, Leonid Brezhnev. Later, how-
ever, when Pravda denounced
Khrushchev with nasty remarks and
when Mr. K’s son-in-law was ousted

 

 

 

Letters to the Editor

as editor of Isvestia, the government
paper, it was obvious that someone
gave Mr. Khrushchev his walking
papers.

lhe big questions being asked now
are: Why was Khrushchev ousted?
Will Brezhnev and Kosygin last in
power (especially as a team)? Will
Soviet foreign policy towards the
West and Communist China change?

Among the reasons most generally
being accepted in the West (most

gleaned from between the lines of|
are |

Pravda and Isvestia articles)
that 1) Khrushchev had not been
able to control the Sino-Soviet split
with Red China 2) Mr. K. had tried
to create a cult of personality,
smacking of the Stalin days 3) he
had not shown dignity worthy of his
position—like pounding his shoes
in the U.N. 4) He was not able to
solve Soviet agricultural problems

Accommodation Gives Reds Win;
James On Mud And Barf Cocktail

Dear Editors:

i

In the editorial column of the|
October 6 Ring-tum Phi was pre-|
sented an idea which is sharing pop- |
ularity in this country and which is)
abhorrent to me. This is the idea that
this nation must endeavor to “ac-
commodate” the forces of commun-
ism.

If the concept of accommodation
becomes an accepted and sanctioned
American policy, it will precipitate
America’s downfall. The world is en-
gaged in a battle between two in-
compatable ideologies, and, since
1917, we have seen that the com-
munist ideology does not “accommo-
date” or “compromise.”

If in this battle we appease and
accommodate, we will suffer only
defeat for the sake of bare existence
The communists gain a major victory
at each instance of our accommoda-
tion, for through our cooperation
and appeasement they gained control
of Eastern Europe, China, Laos,
Cuba, and much of Africa. Where-
ever we have refused to accommo-

 

date (and unfortunately this has

5) Khrushchev generally lost the
confidence of party leaders.

George F. Kennon in a column
in the Washington Post warned
against exaggerating the importance
of the overthrow in the Kremlin.
Kennon felt that the switch was
basically brought on by pressure
from the Chinese-Soviet split. The
only way the Moscow leaders could
see of beginning a_ reconciliation
was to sacrifice Khrushchev as a
peace offering.

The New York Times has stated
that if the Kremlin does not make
more clear why Mr. Khrushchev
was forced to resign, there is a good
chance that a pro-Khrushchev bloc
will further split the Communist
world. A number of Russian satel-
lites have already requested a fur-
ther explanation.

In an attempt to get a wider view
of the situation, I talked to a num-
ber of professors on campus about
the developments. Dr. Milton Colvin,
political science professor, said that
the free world is going to miss old
Khrushchev in the next few years.
The reason, Dr. Colvin explained,
was that Khrushchev was an exper-
ienced statesman, and by “getting
his fingers burned” a few times, he
had learned the ropes. Almost any-
one that the Russians put in the
top positions, including the two in
power now, will be an amateur in
comparison to Khrushchev. Dr. Col-
vin admitted that Mr. K. was no
“good guy” but said that he did
wish to prevent a nuclear war.

The political science teacher added
his feeling that the Brezhnev-Kosy-
gin government was merely an inter-
regnum affair. He stated that neither
man had the dynamic personality

Generals Lose To Susquehanna, 28- 0
Booters Down VP I, 4- 1 For Fifth Victory

General Offense Stopped;
Crusaders Dominate Play

Susquehanna illustrated Saturday why it is ranked fifth
in the nation in small colleges by smashing Washington and
Lee, 28-0, before a large Openings crowd.

In a hard-hitting game, the visitors held the Generals to
a mere two yards on the ground, while amassing 341 yards
themselves. The passing of W&L quarterback Larry Craig

did give the Generals some offen-*

sive punch as Craig connected 10
for 18 for 116 yards.

Although outweighed almost 20
pounds per man on the line, Wash-
ington and Lee seemed to have the
undefeated Crusaders somewhat
slowed down in the initial quarter,
finally allowing speedy scatback Lar-
ry Erdman to burst through from the
seven for a TD. Erdman also added
the two-point conversion putting
Susquchanna ahead, 8-0.

Susquehanna Scores Two

In the second quarter, the Cru-
sader forward wall continued to
open up the middle and gave the
visitors’ halfbacks Erdman and John
Vignone and fullback Bill Galbraith
running room. Early in the second
stanza, Frank Metzger snuck over
for a score from the General one-

football foe, continued on its win-
ning ways this week by defeating

yard line and the try for the two
points was stopped short. Susque-
hanna scored again before halftime
with a three yard off tackle burst by
Bob Hirsch, who also added the two
points to put the Pennsylvanians
ahead at intermission, 22-0.

The third quarter gave the home
crowd some hope as the Generals
drove deep into Crusader territory
with Craig passes finding their mark
regularly. Halfback and co-captain

Bill David contributed to this drive|

with a reception run that covered 28
yards. However, an alert Susque-
hanna safetyman intercepted a hur-
ried Craig aerial on the goal-line to
stop the General drive.

Next week Washington and Lee
will seek to break a two game los-
ing streak against Hampden-Sydney.
The visiting Tigers will bring Whitey
Lipscomb, their vaunted quarter-
back, with them in hopes of repeat-
ing last year’s upset of W&L.

Only Jeff Novinger, the General
center and linebacker, was injured
in this week’s contest, and even he
may be ready for Hampden-Sydney.
W&L will also have the services of
John Anthony, its leading ground

The Generals Never Quit

Last week I inferred that W&L’s
gridders were not convinced that
they could handle Susquehanna.
My reasons for writing that ar-
ticle—and it was for a purpose—
are not important now however
after Saturday’s game no one (and

especially me) can say that
Washington and Lee's football
quit.

From where I sat, | would say
we actually hit harder than the
visitors. Obviously they had a
good, big, fast team, but the Gen-
erals never stopped hitting. There
is no reason for any player, stu-
dent, or fan of W&L to hang his
head in shame; anyone who saw
the game and heard the knocking
must admit that Susquehanna left
town with a few bruises of its own.

If we hit Hampden-Sydney like
we hit Susquehanna, Whitey Lips-
comb best drop way, way back.
Let's get back for last year’s fluke.

Cross-Country Team Beats

Old Dominion, 21-40

The cross-country team won its
sixth victory 21 to 40 Friday against
Old Dominion College on Wilson
Field.

Although losing, Green of Old Do-
minion set a new course record cover-
ingg the distance in 24 min. and 6 sec.
Andy Kilpatrick finished second in
24:41 and Lee Johnson finished third in
24:50. W&L took seven of the first
ten places in the victory.

The Generals are now 6-1. Friday
they meet Catholic University in
Washington.

Record Now 5-0;
As Henry Stars

By Bob Carter
Tuesday Sports Writer

Washington and Lee’s soccer team
recorded its fifth straight victory with-
out defeat Friday with a 4-1 win over
VPI. Playing under a driving rain
storm, the Generals slipped and slid
their way to victory on the muddy
field.

Center forward Tim Henry led the
scoring column with two goals, both
coming on penalty kicks. John Van
Bork and Brad Shinkle tallied the
other two goals.

Wet field conditions and 20 mph
winds considerably hampered play in
the first half. Timing and movements
on pasing were thrown off by the bad
weather.

Backs Howard Busse, Pete Preston,
Dave Redman, and goalie Bob Laurus
played an alert and outstanding de-
fensive game. Tim Henry, John Van

| Bork, Brad Shrinkle led the line in a

productive offensive.

Coach Lyles was pleased with the
play of his substitutes for the first
time. They hustled and kept alert, he
said.

With four games remaining the
team could possibly go undefeated.
Friday the booters meet King College
at Bristol, Tennessee American Uni-
versity, Roanoke College, and Univ.
shof Virginia, all soccer stalwarts, re-
main on the schedule.

Injured Wes Horner is a question
mark for Friday’s game. Coach Lyles
hopes he will be ready to go.

‘The Organizer’ Lacks Balance

(Continued from page 2)
consessions Italian _ proletariat
in later years from their employers
were at least in part derivative of
prior strikes and protests—as ex-
emplified in “The Organizer.”

The promary defect of “The Or-

ganizer” lies in its pace. The first
three-quarters of the film are too
slow the final half-hour moves more

swiftly and is indeed a logical accel-
eration o fthe story: as climax ap-
proaches, so do the speed of the ac-
tion and the sharpness of the cutting
increase — appropriate techniques
here, even if they are well-worn.
But the film remains out of bal-
ance. Monicelli takes too long to
establish his characters, is far too
deliberate in forming the structure
of his plot. He is careful to give
substantial development to any num-
ber of people—Pautasso, the profes-
sor, the young Omero, the inarticu-
late strongman Raul, Pautasso’s
doughter, a Sicilian “immigrant,” the
kind-hearted trollop. It is somewhat
to Monicelli’s credit that his charac-
ters emerge full-bodied but one be-
comes distinctly bored in the process.
Of course, perhaps that was the di-
rector’s intention—to induce in the
audience the desolation that the lab-
orers must have felt but if so, I
think his motives were ill-founded

(which leads to a larger considera-
tion—the value one assigns to en-
tertainment in a movie, a subject

already adequately and inadequately
discussed by others and to which I
won't bother to offer disposition.

Just for my part, I’ll repeat that be-
tween the titles and the last twenty-

five or thirty minutes of “The Or-
ganizer,” I really wasn’t too inter-
ested in what was happening).

On the other hand, I should men-
tion what seemed to me the prin-
cipal strengths of “The Organizer”:
its credibility, its general lack of
sentimentality, and the emotion
which it does manage to evoke in
the closing scenes.

Of the first, one need say little,
only that the story and its person-
alities are completely believable.
Even Mastroianni is accepted as
the indigent professor—a circum-
stance which must be attributed
more to his versatility as an actor
than to the imagination of his
make-up artist, who stretches a
point in giving his subject scumbo
rags, steel-rommed glasses, and an
unkept beard.

The second deserves greater com-
ment. Monicelli presents individuals,
not mouthpiece of ideology. It is
clear enough that “The Organizer” is
anti-management in tone but the
working class is pictured as being
as nearly as depraved as its oppres-
sor. The professor picks up a sand-
wich that a laborer ha sleft in a
meeting room. Mastroianni sets to
eat it but the owner returns and
claims it. It is evident that Mas-
troianni is virtually starving but he
is given a scowl, not charity. Yet
why shouldn’t he be scorned? The
laborer is starving, too. Each is
equally at fault in his self-interest.
Thus here, as throughout “The Or-
ganizer,” Monicelli is encouraging
reform not just of the prevailing
social structure but also of the self-
ishness of its individual components.
And since the former has already
been largely accomplished, one must
imagine that Monicelli is more con-
cerned with the latter.

Last, the final portions of “The
Organizer” are etremely well done.
Monicelli, fairly unobstrusive until
now, steps up the subjective use of
his camera and its added play serves
to intensify the involvement one
feels in the conclusion. The effec-
tiveness of that half-hour makes it
all the more regrettable that Moni-
celli is so reserved in style up to
that point. Perhaps, as previously
suggested, his rigour was calculated;
but whatever his intentions, the
overall impact of “The Organizer”
is sacrificed to the superiority of a
fraction.

CHARLES D. KIMBELL,

Editor, Friday Ring-tum Phi
Dear Sir:

I should like to reply publicly to
the letter of Jim Stalnaker’s in the
October 9 edition of your paper.
Dear Mr. Stalnaker:

If I were to follow the mood that
is prompted by rallies and counter-
raids, I would do my utmost to ridi-
cule you and “cut you down” to
make you and the whole system
look as silly as possible. I do not
plan to use that tactic.

The purpose of rallies is to unite
the pledge class and make the
pledges share an experience, you
say. Mr. Stalnaker, does shoving a
freshman’s face into barf cocktail

 

make him love his fellow pledges? Is
kidnapping the pledge trainer
REALLY an inspiring experience?

You said that rallies remind the
pledge of his duty to stay in line and
respect his older brothers. I say
the pledge respects the older broth-
er LESS when he sees him (the older
brother) involved in such antics. I
say it ENCOURAGES the pledge to
disrespect his older brothers (of
course, he will be “good” more of-
ten, but look how that pledge
WAITS for an opportunity to throw
a sneering remark at an older broth-
er).

Really, Mr. Stalnaker, we ARE in
college, and many of us are physical-
ly over 21 years of age. Are there
not higher values in fraternities than
rallies? Why blanket them with this
infantile smear of mud, eggs, and
barf cocktail?

Strange. I did not MEAIN to make
the system appear foolish—I only
wanted to point out certain facts
about it.

Sincerely,
BILL JAMES

the line, it was because they were
unable to find anybody open.

The running game is also lacking
in big fast backs like Henry Sackett.
Either the backs are fast or small
or big but slow. The best back is
probably John Anthony, but An-
thony was injured and did not play
against the Crusaders.

The defense has been more than
adequate. Against Susquehanna the
defense had to play the majority of
the game because the offense was
unable to control the ball for any
appreciable amount of time. The
shoulder injury early in the game to
star linebacker Jeff Novinger also
added pressure to the defense.

The biggest weakness, though, is

a lack of experienced reserves. The

the coaching staff prefers. By the
fourth quarter the starters begin to
show the wear and tear of their
lack of rest.

ice respectively. The acting exper-
ience of Bright and Reading dates
from Dr. Faustus last year back
to Othello four years ago.

Lockhart Handley and Jay Hight
will take the low comedy parts of
Launcelot and Old Gobbo. Handley
had experience last year as Andro-
cles while Height has also had two
years experience in comedy. As Dr.
Jones aply asserted, “Dr. Shilling-
ton will have his annual appearance
in a part which will show his ample
acting ability.” Dr. Shillington will
portray Tubal, a rich Jew friend of
Shylock.

Filling a variety of roles as ser-
vants, attendants, and officials are
Tim Webster, Paul Cheever, Jim
Settle, John Crigler, Roger Clarke,
Don Raybold, Evan Jeffries, and
Jay Cady.

Mrs. Martha Evans, wife of Pro-

 

fessor John Evans of the English
department, will star as Portia. Al-
though Mrs. Evans will appear for
her first time on the stage at
W&L, she has had previous acting
experience elsewhere. Kendall Jam-
ison, a senior at Lexington High
School, will portray Nerissa while
Joan Parham will take the role of
Jessica.
Plot Summary

The rich, fair, and wise lady Por-
tia of Belmont has many suitors, one
of whom is Bassanio, a penniless,
attractive, young Venetian gentle-
man. In order to court Portia, Bas-
sanio is foreed to borrow money
from his generous friend, Antonio.
Antonio then borrows money from
a rich Jewish usurer, Shylock. Shy-
lock shrewdly agrees to lend the
money to Antonio with no interest,@
but a stipulation that Antonio will
forfeit a pound of flesh if he fails
to repay his debt on time.

Meanwhile back at the ranch,
Bassanio wins the hand of the fair
Portia, while his friend Gratiano has
married Nerissa, Portia’s waiting
maid. However, Antonio has failed to
repay Shylock on time..

Bassanio and Gratiano go back
to Venice to try to get Antonio out
of jail. Without anyone’s knowledge,
Portia and Nerissa, disguised as doc-
tors attend the trial of Antonio as
judges. They corner Shylock and
he is lucky to leave the court at
all. Then they tease Bassanio and
Gratiano and get their wedding
rings back as a gift of their services.

When Bassanio and Gratiano re-
turn to Belmont they discover that
their wives had disguised themselves
as judges. The ending is a happy
one for all but Shylock.

 

 

The Troubadours, who will present the “Merchant of Venice” Novem-

WE&L Student Aid Program
Increases Nearly Five-Fold

A nearly five-fold increase in un-
dergraduate financial aid over the
past decade was reported Monday
at Washington and Lee.

Lewis G. John, assistant dean of
students and director of the Univer-
sity’s financial aid program, an-
nounced that 257 Washington and
Lee students are sharing in $218,180
in scholarships, loans, and campus
jobs during the 1964-65 academic
session.

Dean John said that the total
represents a 487 per cent increase
over the level of undergraduate aid
ten years ago, when only $44,970
was available.

The current assistance also rep-
resents a significant increase over
1963-64 aid levels, when 246 stu-
dents shared $191,365 in aid funds,
Dean John said.

He pointed out that the under-
graduate totals do not include schol-
arships and loans awarded in the
School of Law where a separate
program of financial aid is adminis-
tered by Dean Charles Light, Jr.

Dean Light reported that 41 law
students are sharing in $24,372 in
financial aid this year.

Among undergraduate aid recipi-
ents are 60 freshmen who are re-
ceiving a total of $63,840, compared
to 1963-64 figures which show that
50 freshmen received $46,560 in aid
funds.

Dean John said that the average
amount of aid extended to under-
graduates is $810, while the freshmen
average is $1,064. He said the high
freshman average is the result of
joint efforts of increased expenses
for entering students and a substan-
tial inerease in the average need
of new students seeking financial
aid.

All financial aid at Washington
and Lee is based on need, academic

merit, and promise of successful
work at Washington and Lee. A
faculty scholarship committee is re-
sponsible for selecting aid recipients
among applicants for financial aid.

Scholarship funds awarded for

awards at Washington and Lee are
George F. Baker Scholarships, sup-
ported by the George F. Baker Trust

of New York, and the Robert E. Lee
Scholarships, suppored by an anon-
ymous benefactor.

There are 12 Baker Scholars at!
Washington and Lee, sharing a total)
of $13,250 in aid, including fresh-
men who are receiving $3,950. Lee
Scholarships are held by 16 under-
graduates, including six freshmen.
Of the $16,650 Lee funds allocated
this year, $7,400 went to the first
year men.

A total of 120 students are par-

‘Dining Hall Removal of R-t P’s

Causes Delay Of Frosh Election

By GUY UNANGST

The Executive Committee

has set for Monday the post-

poned run-off election for freshman committeeman.

In a statement made after

its special meeting last night,

the committee said it has postponed the run-off originally
scheduled yesterday morning, to investigate rumors resulting

from the disappearance of the
from the coramons.

A waiter had taken the news-
papers “in order that the freshmen
would not prolong their evening
mea,l” the statement said.

“The basic reason (the election was
postponed) was the fact that there
were so many unfounded rumors
going around in the freshman dorm,”
Jim Kulp, student body president,
said last night.

The lead story in Tuesday’s news-
paper was on the original freshman
committeeman ballot, in which none
of the four candidates were able to
gain a majority vote. A banner head-
line had said, “Independent Fresh-
men Stop Clique.”

It was variously rumored that sup-
porters of Richard Nash, the Uni-
versity Party candidate, had ob-
jected to the headline and removed
the newspapers, that supporters of
Steve Saunders, an independent!
candidate, had removed them so as
to blame the University Party, and
that the Executive Committee would
take no action, Kulp said.

“We postponed the election to
find out who took them (the papers)
and why,” explained Kulp. “Politics
did not enter into the picture.”

The run-off, between Nash, who
received 111 votes last Monday, and
Saunders, who received 83, has been

 

STATEMENT OF THE EXECU-
TIVE COMMITTEE CONCERN-
ING THE POSTPONEMENT OF
FRESHMAN EC ELECTION:

Due to the number of unfounded
rumors circulating in the Freshman
Dormitory resulting from the dis-
appearance of the Ring-tum Phi
on Tuesday from Evans Dining Hall,
the Executive Committee determined
that it would be unfair to both can-
didates to continue the election, It
was the opinion of the committee
that until such times as the true
facts concerning this occurrence
were brought to light, the election
would be postponed.

From an investigation conducted
by the Executive Committee it was
revealed that the newspapers had
been removed from their usual place
by a waiter and placed in a side
room of the dining hall. On several
ocassions in the past waiters have
removed the newspapers in order

their evening meal. The investiga-
tion further revealed that the waiter
who removed the papers Tuesday
did so for the above stated purpose
and not to promote the election of
either candidate,

The Executive Comimttee will
take the appropriate action to in-
sure that the above practice does
not reoccur in the future.

The election for Freshman EC has
been rescheduled in Washington Hall
on Monday 26 October 1964 from
8:15 am. until 1:00 p.m.

 

scheduled for this Monday from
8:15 a.m. until 1 p.m.

Two other candidates, Jody Kline
and John Reynolds, both running
independently, had failed to make
the run-off.

Remarking on the missing news-
papers, Nash said last night, “It
might have added a little comic re-
lief to the whole thing. I only want
to urge that the freshmen look at
the candidates not be prejudiced
because one candidate is supported
by a party.”

Nash forces had charged, in a
Wednesday statement, that Saun-
ders had campaigned for the Pro-
gressive Party nomination and then,
when that party was dissolved, had
“championed the cause of the inde-
pendent.”

In reply to the University Party
charge, Steve Saunders stated that
“after the second (Ring-tum Phi pre-
ferential) poll, there was a period
in which I was not going to run
because I came out third, and I
thought the nominations would go
to the top two. The Progressive
Party never did make a nomination.
After the party realignment, I felt
there might be a chance for an in-
dependent candidate.

“If elected, I would put out some
kind of a regular bulletin... to keep
the freshmen aware of what the
EC is doing. Past freshmen commit-
teemen didn't find out what the
freshmen wanted—what the fresh-
men thought.”

Of the two candidates who drop-
ped out of the race in the primary,
only John Reynolds has publicly
supported either candidate. Rey-
nolds, who received 31 votes Mon-
day , has said he favors Saunders.

Rey de la Torre has been heard
by country-wide audiences in re-
citals and concert appearances, and
in various television shows such as
the “Guitar” Show on CBS-TV. He
has also been guest on such tele-
vision programs as the Jack Parr
Show, Today Show, and Camera 3.
Among distinguished appearances for
Rel de la Torre was his porform-
ance of a concerto for guitar by
Joaquin Rodrigo in premieres for the
United States with the Cleveland
Orchestra.

As an artist, Rey de la Torre is in
close touch with contemporary musi-
cal developments, particularly of the
United States and Latin America, with
special interest for his youthful asso-
in Havana. Many of h works
written especially for him by a
variety of major Latin-American com
poet

During the spring of 1962, Rey de
la Torre was heard in recitals in
Beigium. France, West Germany,
Greece, Iran and Lebanon. After the

Choice Of The Freshmen

The election has been postponed.

Freshmen Candidates State Views

Richard Nash

I am glad to have this opportunity to express myself to you
and clear up a few things. For it is only by learning the truth
that you can make an honest desicion and vote for the better
qualified candidate.

Steve Saunders

I want to thank all those freshmen who worked and voted
for me during this campaign. Without their electoral,
moral, and financial support our campaign could not have
gotten started.

The most probable reaction of this has been, “Oh, no,
not another four days of this political chaos, complete with
propaganda and name-calling.” However, the interest and
energy which this campaign has generated is a healthy sign—
it reveals a new sense of freshman responsibility, a concern
with the election of the most qualified candidate.

Many of those freshmen who are pledges of houses in
the University Party will be told that it benefits their house if
they vote for, and elect, the party’s candidate. Two things
should be considered by these freshmen: first, party instability
in the past points to the possibility that those in the party to-
day may not be in the same party tomorrow. Thus, their par-
ticular house may easily be merely a vehicle for another house’s
gain.

Secondly, and more importantly, this political fury is
transient; its death is near. The student government must
operate throughout the year. It is therefore evident that the
choice of the man, and not the mandate of the party, is of more
importance in the long run.

The fact of Nash’s party nomination doesn’t make him
any less qualified a candidate. Likewise, the fact of Saunder’s
lack of clique nomination shouldn’t detract from his being
given equal consideration as an able candidate.

Both candidates are qualified men, or they wouldn’t have
gained such strong support in the primary last Monday. We
wish, however, to emphasize the fact that the freshman Execu-
tive Committeeman should be elected as the freshman’s choice,
and not as the upperclassmen’s. This is a free election; you
have the right to vote for the man of your choice; don’t let
anyone deprive you of that precious freedom.

Because the freshman EC post should be held by the man
of the freshmen’s choice, we present here statements from
candidates for the voters’ consideration. We hold no party
lines, nor do we endorse any candidates. We have our prefer-
ence, of course, but above all else we'd like to see the freshman
class making up its own mind.

We present the men. We urge freshmen to meet them,
Question them. Decide which of the two candidates is your
choice as the most qualified. Then vote for the man of your
choice, without paying attention to anything but the man him.

self.

Editorial Freedom

“I do not approve of what you say, but I will defend to the
death your right to say it.” —Voltaire

Tuesday’s editorial endorsement of Steve Saunders has
generated a great deal of controversial feeling to the effect that
the Ring-tum Phi has no right to endorse either one candidate
or the other.

Friday's Ring-tum Phi feels that the choice of the freshman
Executive Committeeman should be left up to the freshman.
We choose therefore not to endorse either candidate.

No matter how differently the two editions of the
paper may feel about this, the belief of this staff is that
the Ring-tum Phi has the right to express any opinion
it may so desire in an editorial column,

Editorial opinion is editorial opinion. It is there for the
student’s consideration. In its editorial opinion, the Ring-tum
Phi is under obligation neither to anyone nor to any ideology
or representation of the majority student opinion. That the
opinion expressed should be in good taste goes without saying.

The Friday staff may not always approve of Tues-
day’s editorial policy, but it will defend its right to say
whatever it pleases. This is, after all, the essence of a

 

free society. ,

First I would like to straighten out something concerning

the University Party. When I was asked to run for the Execu-
tive Committee by the fraternities in
the party, I made it a point to find
out one thing—“Will I have any ob-
ligations?” And I can honestly say
to you that I had no obligations then,
I have no obligations now, and if
elected, will have none in the fu-
ture.

Remember, you are not electing a
party, but one man to serve you
on the Executive Committee. You
want a man that is mature enough
and level headed enough to make the
right decisions. The only man that
can do that is the candidate that
is most like you, one that knows
and understands how you feel and
what you want. I cannot believe that
you, a freshman at Washington and
Lee University, will vote for a can-
didate for the Executive Committee
on the basis of whether or not he
has the support of a party.

If you have taken the time to
read this letter, thank you very
much. And please, if you have any

his sexual proclivities. (Jenkins, 60
years old, has probably been prac-
ticing homesexuality for 30 or more
years. Men ordinarily do not, the
psychologists tell us, turn to per-
version late in life, but rather show
histories of such activities begin-
ning in their 20’s or even earlier).

Certainly he should long ago

mercifully—from any position in-

That he was not is a fact worth
pondering.

Perhaps he was particularly use-
ful, intelligent, and productive in his
job; perhaps he was simply a close
friend and ally of the President,
providing Johnson with personal
advice and comfort; perhaps his
homosexuality was incidental to the
man.

Whatever the reasons for Jenkins’
being kept on as a governmental
employee, they are bound to run
counter to legal and social attitudes
dominant in America.

The Real Tragedy
And this is the real tragedy. Why
was Jenkins vulnerable, an obvious
security risk? Surely not because
of his homosexuality, but rather be-
cause of society's unrealistic view-
point toward the homosexual.

Statistics vary as to the num-
ber of male homosexual in
America, One in six men, sup-
posedly, experiences sex with a
male sometime in his adult life.

The best and most reliable figures
indicate that between one in ten
and one in twenty men are prac-

ticing homesexuals, preferring
gratification with other men to
gratification with women, (This,
incidentally, would mean that be-
tween 30 and 100 Washington and

consenting male adults—to be pun-
ishable by imprisonment.

It is widely known among psy-
chologists and psychiatrists that the
average adult homosexual can lead
a productive, enriching life—if he is
allowed to do so. Because of the
legal and soeal sanctions against
him, however, he is forced to live
in two worlds, forced to be constant-
ly on guard against discovery.
Needless to say, such a state is
bound to limit a man’s achievements,
to make him neurotic and anxiety-
ridden.

at hand. For the past week, we have
forcefully presented a positive cam-
paign, based on positive ideas and a
positive candidate. We urged the
freshman class to “Vote for Leader-
ship,” not against anybody or any-
thing. We did not seek to advance
my candidacy by defaming my op-
ponent. Unfortunately, there are
those who apparently believe such
defamation adds to the success—if
not the moral luster—-of a campaign.
They believe that inept and crude
rumor tactics will impress the fresh-
man class. They think that if a lie
is big enough and loud enough, it
will drown out all voices to the con-
trary. They believe that the end will
justify the means.

But they are wrong. No end of
theirs is noble enough, no lie big
enough, and no false rumor be-
lievable enough to sway the body
of the freshman class. They can no
longer hide behind the facade of
innocence and humility which has
been so painstakingly created. Their
bag of tricks is empty. They now
stand before our class as the cyni-
cal and ruthless power-magnates
that they are .I need not go further.
All freshmen can decide the “truth”
for themselves. I do not choose to
leap down into the gutter to counter
the attacks of my opposition. Nor do
I believe that anything will be
gained by attacking them on any
but the central issue in this cam-
paign: qualification for office.

I offer for Executive Com-
mitteeman because I believe I have
the experience and ability necessary
to do the best possible job of repre-
senting the freshman class. It is my
feeling that this cireumstance has
not changed, neither has the issue
of qualification. If some deplore the
extent of our campaign, I hope they
remember that I labored under the
disadvantage of being an indepen-

‘Shot in the Dark’ Is Sill
Despite Emphasis On Slapstick

By JAMES JENNINGS

Inspector Cloiseau is back, and
this time he does a few things

oe) ae we right and even
gets the girl. Pet-
er Sellers, as
Cloiseau, teams up
with Elke Som-
mer, Hollywood's
new sex-machine,
to find out who
fired the “Shot in

the Dark” at

George Sanders’

chateau. The

movie is funny,

Jennings sexy, funny, tir-
ing, funny.

The opening scene of the movie
reveals everything but discloses
nothing. Apparently everyone in
Sanders household has a lover some-
where in the house, and there is
quite a bit of moving about every
night. Unfortunately, somebody does
not like the way that things are
going and a person is killed. Cloiseau
is called in on the case and four-
teen deaths later the case is closed,
and Cloiseau has solved a very com-
plicated series of murders. Among
the dead are a gardener, a couple
of nightclubbers, a Cossack, and a
doorman who just happened to be
standing around when Cloiseau is

present.

Tiresome
Sellers is very funny as usual,
but after sitting through “Pink

 

Panther” and part of “Shot in the
Dark,” one gets tired of Sellers’ no
longer subtle humor. He has be-
come very slapstick and American-
ized. Toward the end of the movie,
he is somewhat of an adult's Jerry
Lewis, only not as funny. The viewer
is prepared for most of his bits,
and he never disappoints us by pass-
ing one up. In his earlier movies,
Sellers is not so anxious to be fun-
ny every minute and, as a result,
his early movies are extremely fun-
ny and not so tiring as “A Shot in
the Dark.” The viewer never gets
a chance to catch his breath or really
think about the plot in this flick.
There has to be some seriousness in
a comedy so that it will not fall
flat on its face. There is none because
even the Commissioner, who should
be serious, out-does Sellers in some
of the scenes. Sanders, who would
serve a8 a serious counterpart, is

never on the screen except as
Sellers’ fall guy.
Successful

However, “A shot in the Dark” is
a successful movie, even if it does
not follow a sensible formula for
comedy. Sommer and Sellers make
a great team and are able to hold
our attention even though they
wear us out. Naturally, Elke Som-
mer is not allowed to dé any real
acting for the benefit of the movie,
and her own career as well, Need-
less to say, those things which she
is allowed to do she does quite well.

Generals, Tigers Clash Here Tomorrow

Lipscomb Leads Hampden-Sydney,

Team Has 4-1 Record This Year

By GUY UNANGST
Hampden-Sydney has scored 14 touchdowns en route to
four victories in its first five games. Quarterback Whitey Lips-
comb, only a junior, has had a hand in eight of them, several

in a spectacular way.

He has scored twice on short runs, returned punts 23 and}
74 yards for scores and passed for touchdowns of four, six, |
48 and 68 yards. *

[Stats Reveal General Air, 7

Lipscomb became a_ starter in
the last two games of his freshman
year, when All-Little Eight quarter-
back Fredie Mitchell was switched
to halfback. Last season he received
enough votes not only to be the
only sophomore on the All-Little
Eight team, but to be its captain as
well. He was also named the Tigers’
Most Valuable Player.

The 6-foot 185-pounder, who is
22 years old, does everything well,
trite though that may sound. He
starts at safety as well as quarter-
back and his two long touchdown
returns attest to his ability to re-
turn kicks.

Fifth in Virginia in scoring last
year, the Richmonder is probably
second only to Virginia Tech’s Bob
Schweikert among state quarter-
backs.

Lipscomb is not all the Tigers
have. Thirty-four men, including 18
lettermen returned from last year’s
team, which posted a 6-3 record and
defeated W&L, 12-11.

Five returnees earned All-Star
honors last year. The best are end
George Heilig, who has caught two
of Limpscomb’s touchdown tosses,
and tackle Sandy McLaughlin, a
senior and Washington and Lee
coach Lee McLaughlin’s nephew.

The two are co-captains of the
Tigers. Heilig holds the school re-
ceiving record while McLaughlin,
who missed first team All-Little
Eight honors by one vote last sea-

(Continued on page 4)

 

Ground Games Equal

Stastically, Washington and Lee’s
Generals are a much better team
than their 1-3 record indicates. Of-
ficial statistics for the Generals’ first
four games show that the W&L of-
fense has gained more yardage than
the defense has given up...even af-
ter last week’s game against Sus-
quehanna.

Through these first games, the
Generals have gained a net of 886

yards while their four opponents|'

have gained a net total of 806 yards

from scrimmage. The statistics had|

been even better before last week’s
Susquehanna game when the Cru-
saders gained a net of 365 yards
compared to just 156 from W&L.

Statistics also reveal a remarkable
balance in the Washington and Lee
offense. Through the first four games,
the Generals have gained exactly
443 yards rushing and 443 yards
passing for their total of 886 yards.

The pass defense reveals itself
to be outstanding. Opposition teams
have tried just 18 passes against
General defenders and have com-
pleted only six for just 79 yards. The
General rushing defense has been
slightly porous, having given up 727
yards.

W&L’'s red-hot soccer team (pictured above in their 5-1 victory over
Belmont Abbey) put their unbeaten record on the line this afternoon
against King College at Bristol, Tennessee. The Generals, possessors of

 

 

a 5-0 record, were rated as slight favorites in today’s game despite injuries
to several key men, Starting outside left Wes Horner did not make the
journey due to a badly bruised hip, opening up a gap in the front line
which was worsened by the absence of substitute forward Pete Heumann,
kept at home by a heavy test schedule. John Laimbeer will take over
Horner's position. Another second-string forward, inside Claude Rogers,
was afflicted with tendonitis and was not expected to be able to play.
And All-American candidate Dave Redmond was hampered by bruised
ribs, weakening the fullback position which has been the mainstay of
Coach Lyles’ booters this season.

Before its meeting last year with

tion’s longest winning streak—22

|hanna has won 13 straight since

Upsala also defeated the Crusad-

for the only two losses Susquehanna
has suffffered during coach Jim Gar-
rett’s four and a half seasons as
head coach. Garret’s record is 36-2-1.

“We want Upsala and we want
them badly,” Garrett said. “Our
team knows that we didn’t play
well against them and it has irri-
tated us ever since. We want to
win Saturday to regain our pride.”

 

Shooters Start Practice

Prospects for this year’s Washing-
ton and Lee rifle team are looked
on as uncertain, according to Ser-
geant Jim McSheffrey, coach of the
rifle team.

The team has been practicing for
more than a week now for its sea-
son opener on November 20 when
the University of Virginia squad
comes to Lexington for a dual meet
at the VMI rifle range. The squad
this year has a ten meet schedule.
Junior Harold Klick is captain of
the squad.

The freshman team, also coached
by McSheffrey, will open its five
meet schedule on December 5 with
a match against Staunton Military
Academy at the VMI rfle range.

‘Key Injuries Again Hamper W&L;
‘Brookby Novinger Are Doubtful

By JOHNNY GRAHAM

The Tigers that invade Wilson Field torommow afternoon
|| will be in football pads rather than gasoline tanks and will
| provide a severe test for Washington and Lee’s comeback-

Hampden-Sydney carries a 4-1 record into this crucial con-

test that may prove to be a grudge bout on both sides. The
* Tigers defeated W&L 12-11 last year

in a contest that many observers
called a fluke win. Hampden-Syd-
new is always primed for the W&L
game, considering the Generals their
major Virginia smal lIcollege rical.

The game has a history of being
a close bout. In the last four years,
there has not been over a one touch-
down margin. The Generals hold a
13-6 margin in the history of the
series.

Coach Lee McLaughlin will have
nearly his entire squad for tomor-
row’s contest. John Anthony, the
team’s leading ground gainer from
his fullback position, returns from
an injury that sidlined him for the
entire Susquehanna game. Jeff Nov-
inger, who sustained a shoulder in-
jury against the Crusaders, is a
doubtful starter. Halfback Henry
Brookby will be able to play, but
is a doubtful starter since he has
been unable to practice all week.

Hampden-Sydney is the first team
that the Generals have met all sea-
son that likes to pass. Thus far
in the campaign, four W&L oppon-
ents have completed six passes for
79 yards while the Generals have
connected with 42 passes for 443
yards, the same as the rushing yard-
age. The Generals’ rushing total of
two yards against Susquehanna is
misleading, by the way. The team
rolled for 42 yards from scrimmage,
but several long losses cut into this
yardage.

With 19 lettermen returning from
last year’s 6-3 team, Hampden-Syd-
ney shows a ballanced attack that
has punch both on the ground and
through the air. Quarterback Whitey
Lipscomb is one of the state’s best
and is ablely backed up by a trio
of running backs.

Coach MeLaughlin, although not
pleased with the showing, did see
some good points in last week’s game.
“We came out of a tough game
with the right mental attitude,” he
stated. “We never quit, and were

still hitting hard in the fourth quar-
ter.”

It occurred to me at the time
that they would have come to see
her no matter how she phrased it.

Similarly, no matter how my Eng-
lish teacher would have said it...

Getting there

Have you ever had the feeling
that you never are going to Get
There?

What I mean is this: whenever you
arrive at some great point in life
the powers that be always say that
the next place is the ultimate one.

I remember ’way back in kinder-
garten they said that grade school
was it.

That sounded fine to me, but in
grade school I learned that life
would really unfold in junior high.

Patiently I waited.

Now at last. But junior high}
pointed to senior high, and, yes,
senior high directed me to the Col-
lege of My Choice .

So here we are.

After being led from hope to hope
we arrive at the great door of
knowledge only to be told that our
dreams will be fulfilled after col-
lege, in the Market Place or in the
Higher Academy.

I give up.

Each fraternity will be allowed to

Besides the various fraternity

The possibility of shortened classes
on the Saturday of Homecomings
was discussed and placed in the
form of a motion to petition the
Faculty Committee. With shortened
classes, fraternities could serve the
mid-day lunch earlier, thus en-

It was also moved by the EC to

KA National

Locates Here

Plans have been confirmed for
the locating of the national head-
quarters of Kappa Alpha Order in
Lexington and the erection of a
headquarters building on the site of
the Barclay house on Lee Avenue.

The national fraternity, which re-
cently purchased the Barclay prop-
erty will raze the present house and
build a colonial-style structure to
cost an estimated $110,000.

The total invesment of the frater-
nity in the headquarters property
will approximate $150,000 according
to Henry J. Foresman, a member of
the executive council of the Order.

Confirmation of the plans to con-
struct the headquarters here came
at a meeting of the executive coun-
cil in Atlanta last weekend. The
Order expects to break ground for
the headquarters next August during
its 100th anniversary convention.

The centennial convention will
open in Roanoke Tuesday, Aug. 24.

It will adjourn to Lexington, the
site of its founding, Friday, August
27 for commemorative and ceremon-

 

ial events.

Complete room and board for these
boys is provided by the host fra-
ternity, while tuition for two of
them is absorbed by the school with
the third receiving a_ scholarship
given by alumnus I. M. Scott. There
are usually seven or eight houses
on campus that wish to have a for-
eign students live with them for
the school year. they submit a re-
quest to the IFC and then consider
the applicants to see which one they
want. Final selection is made by
a pot-luck picking of names when
more than one fraternity is inter-
ested. Rarely, however, does one
house sponsor a boy for two years
in a row.

Dr. George F. Drake, present fac-
ulty co-ordinator of the program,
emphasized that while most Euro-
pean universities do not accept credit
given in the United States, the ex-
perience of the boys participating
is one of a practical nature rather
than specific, with the knowledge
learned something to be carried all
their lives.

these people be hurting—besides,
perhaps, themselves? Would it be
wise to utilize their minds, to per-
mit them full, rich lives, to treat
inversion as incidental to the oth-
er facets of their personalities, and
not as a heinous “crime against na-
ture?”

Yes, the Jenkins affair was “unfor-
tunate.” That such a thing can ever
happen is most unfortunate.

Beta Pledge

Beats Saunders
By Five Votes

By GARETH ADEN
Managing Editor

It was announced early yes- |)

terday afternoon that Richard
Nash, the University Party

candidate, had beaten Steve |
Saunders, an independent can- |

didate for the freshman rep-
resentative to the Executive Com-
mittee. Nash
against 141 cast for Saunders.

The narrow margin of five votes
climaxed a long and eventful cam-

paign for the freshman post. In the |
original election a week ago neither |

of these two candidates had been
able to poll a majority of the votes
cast. As a result they were pitted
in a run-off that was finally con-

cluded Monday. *

Small Turnout

Despite the excitement that the un-
usual election generated, the turn-
out at the polls yesterday was still
disappointing. Only 287 out of 338
of the freshman class turned in bal-
lots. This was an improvement on
the 267 that voted last week in the
original election, however.

Nash, obviously glad to have the
election over with, said he wanted to
thank those who had worked for
him and all who had voted for him.
He pledged to do his best in the
coming year in his new posit.on,
but declined at this time to make
any specific statement on the cam-
paign.

Saunders seemed to have taken the
news in stride. He made it clear
that he was not sorry he had run,
rather he felt that his campaign had
accomplished something. He felt that
he had proved a candidate could
run strongly even without the sup-
port of upper-classmen or party af-
filiation. Especially significant, said
Saunders was the fact that he had
been able to stop the party in the
first election.

He made it clear that he wisheJ
Nash the best of luck and was sure
that Nash would have the support
of the freshman class in the coming

year.

Freshmen Siehuter
Take Two Trophies

In Rosemont Meet

By DON OHARE

Tuesday Columnist

W&L debaters won two of six tro-
phies given at the Rosemont Invi-
tational meet in Philadelphia last
weekend. Rusty Meyer won the sec-
ond place speaker’s award, and his
teammate George Dover followed
with the third place award as the
pair went to a four and one record.

Jeff Wceinscott and Tommy Bare-
more completed the W&L team,
which was one of 26 four-man teams
in the tournament. It was the first
time, says director of forensics Wil-
liom Chaffin, that he has ever taken
an all-freshman team to a varsity
tournament.

One Negative Loss

In team competition, W&L finished
the weekend with a record of six
wins and four defeats. The negative
team of Meyer and Dover won four
of their five matches while Wains-
cott and Baremore, debating the
affirmative, won two and lost three.

The Negative team defeated
Princeton, Penn State, Temple, and
Scranton, while losing only to West
Point. The affirmative team recorded
victories over Rosemont and Rut-
gers, and lost one of their maches
to the tournament-winning team
from Seton Hall University (10-0).

Good Season Predicted

The W&L Debate Team will be
taking trips every weekend to
matches and tournaments all over
the East. The schedule will be high-
lighted by a tournament at George-
town University and a cross-exam-
ination meet at Pace College in New
York City.

According to Mr. Chaffin, debate
team director, the combination of
experience and enthusiasm demon-
strated by the varsity and freshmen
debaters this year points toward a
successful season for the Washing-
ton and Lee team.

The national debate topic for this
year is, Resolved: that the federal

Robert E. Lee Letter
Added To Archives

A letter written 100 years ago
this week by General Robert E. Lee,
in which he reflected his deeply re-
ligious nature, has been added to
the Lee Archives at Washington and
Lee University.

The letter is one of two brief let-
ters by Lee given to Washington and
Lee by Miss Ellinor Porcher Gads-
den, of Lexington, granddaughter of
the Rev. William Nelson Pendleton
who was Lee’s artillery commander
in the Army of Northern Virginia
during the Civil War, and to whom
the letters were addressed.

Dr. Ollinger Crenshaw, head of
Washington and Lee’s history de-
partment and chairman of the Lee
Archives committee, describes the
gift of Miss Gadsden’s letter as “a
most valuable addition to the uni-
versity’s collection of Lee papers.”

One letter was written on October
21, 1864, with Lee headquartered near
Chaffins Bluff between Richmond
and Petersburg, facing a long win-
ter’s siege by Generals Grant and
Meade and ultimate defeat at Ap-
pomattox the following April.

The second letter is dated August
28, 1865, when Lee was at Carters-
ville, Va., considering the invitation
of the Washington College trustees

The announcement that racial dis-
crimination will not enter into W&L
admissions policy was made for the
first time today, but the decision
was made last summer by the Board
of Trustees. The Trustees’ act came
in the form of a statement to the
faculty that admissions policies were
at the discretion of the professors,
who had favored integration pre-
viously.

At the first faculty meeting of this
year, President Cole told the facul-
ty of the Board’s step. Since then
rumor about approaching integration
has hovered over the W&L campus;
but the Board held back from a
public announcement. The Trustees
met again last weekend, and finally
authorized the President to release
the state prnited on page two of this
paper.

There are no applications from

» Negroes now being considered by

the Committee on Admissions. Ap-
parently no colored students will ap-
ply for the next school year, since
none have made thorough inquiries
to the admissions offices.

Resolution Power

The ODK Forum was established
last year to discuss questions of
concern to the University as a whole.
The body has the power of resolu-
tion, and thus can be a powerful
influence for or against administra-
tion policy.

The presidents of fraternities, cap-
tains of athletic teams, leaders of
campus organizations, and members
of ODK and the Executive Commit-
tee are invited to participate in the
Forum, founded last year by the
ODK Circle with the cooperation of
the EC.

The Inevitable Answer

Today’s statement from President Fred
C. Cole’s office (printed elsewhere on this
page) affirming that Washington and Lee
will not discriminate among applicants because
of race, is the inevitable answer to the question
of integration. It is the answer which the fac-
ulty probably would have given at least sev-
eral years ago, had the Board of Trustees
given it explicit opportunity as it has done in
the present statement. It is an answer confirm.
ing the policy of non-discrimination which has
always been implied in the University cata-
logue’s broad admission requirements. Al-
though it is bound to arouse some criticism,
it is the answer demanded by the present
world, and even more so, by the future. It
is the only answer possible if this University
is to continue to profess the high ideals which
have historically guided it and made it great.
It is an answer which prevents Washington
and Lee from becoming isolated from other
educational institutions, and it is one which re-
moves this school from the suspicion of pre-
judice. It is an answer of which the student
body can justly be proud, and which it should
actively support.

The answer came freely, not under the in-
fluence of direct pressure from any source. It
was under the initiative of the University, not
in response to an admissions “crisis.” No Ne-
gro has ever completed an application to
Washington and Lee, and so there has never
been a test case which would have established
precedent. Neither has there been any public
statement from the W&L Committee on Ad-
missions regarding the attitude it would take
toward Negro applicants.

This is not to say that there has never been
an “understood’’ policy of discrimination in
admissions, of what “would have happened” if
a Negro had applied; or that the statement
given to the Ring-tum Phi by President Cole
today does not represent an important step.
Yet during the past several years, as students
sought an answer to the question of integra-
tion, they never received refusals. Obviously
the question was in limbo, undecided for a
while; and it could only be finally resolved at
the Board of Trustees’ meeting last summer.
It is fortunate that the answer was at last given
freely, rather than from a defensive position.
Now the question which must be asked univer-
sally of every educational institution, can be
answered honorably at Washington and Lee.

What now? There are still no Negro ap-
plicants, and so the new statement of non-
discrimination may not even have been needed
this year, maybe not next. But sooner or later,
Negroes are going to apply to, be accepted by,
and enter this University. It is incumbent on
the Committee on Admissions to be certain
that these first Negro entrants are equal to
Washington and Lee’s high standards. Wa&L
cannot afford to accept outright the first Ne-
groes who apply, merely for the sake of boast-
ing an integrated student body. This is a mis-
take which some other institutions have made,
and one which can ruin the hope of a smooth
process of integration. If the first Negro en-
trants are anything less than their classmates,

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

 

then the impression they make here could be
harmful to a rapid integration in student life.
This is a consideration which must already
have entered the minds of the Committee.

But no matter how well qualified the first
colored students here, there will be some stu-
dents who will resent their presence. These
men will be faced with a reality, already ac-
cepted at most schools, which will be all the
more workable the sooner it is accepted here.
Some will be slow to reconcile themselves;
but prejudice opposed to reason should soon
disappear. The student body should realize
that the advantages of integration will far
outweigh the temporary discomforts of
change; that education insulated from the re-
ality of American life is incomplete.

It is unlikely, of course, that more than
several Negroes will enter any one class in the
foreseeable future. The decision to accept
qualified Negroes is not going to dilute the
student body, nor its quality. There will be
no rush, no flood of integration. Washington
and Lee is not going to change or lose its
character; actually the admissions statement is
not even a reversal of policy, since no Negroes
have ever been refused admission. Instead,
the statement is a confirmation of what has
always been true in W&L’s stated policies:
there has never been a policy of discrimina-
tion. The decision to affirm this fact was the
only decision possible in the Washington and
Lee tradition, a tradition of idealism and right
action.

It Happens Every Year

The University Party, as usual, pulled the
election out of the fire. With fifty freshmen
failing to vote, the Clique candidate squeaked
through by five votes, although without win-
ning a majority of his class. The margin of
Richard Nash’s victory was supplied by party
organization. Steve Saunders ran a good cam-
paign, but when voting day came around,
more of his voters stayed home than did
Nash’s, prodded by the Party. The University
Party’s win is good evidence of its strength;
and a bad sign for any candidates for spring
elections who may happen not to be in the
Party.

Nash is very well qualified to hold the of-
fice he has won and should be a valuable
member of the Executive Committee. That
he would be a popular candidate was apparent
from the first Ring-tum Phi preferential bal-
loting several weeks ago. According to some
thinking, Nash actually was considered such
a strong candidate that the new University
Party was formed to nominate him.

Nash proved his appeal, as well as the fine
organization of his Party, by pulling out the
election. But the number of independent can-
didates who originally opposed him, and the
closeness of the final tally, are hopeful indi-
cations that in the spring campus politics may
turn away from Clique Control. Perhaps next
spring it will not even be beyond the realm
of possibility for an independent candidate
to be nominated by popular voice and to win
an election against the Party.

 

“That Democratic anti-poverty drive is really paying off
for old Lyndon’s campaign, isn’t it.”

Admission Rules Up To Faculty;
No Race Discrimination at W &L

Washington and Lee University’s
Board of Trustees has reaffirmed the
university faculty’s responsibility in
determining standards of admission
for qualified applicants.

President Fred C. Cole said today
that “The Board of Trustees has no
cause to doubt the appropriateness
of this delegation of authority to the
faculty and has no cause to doubt
the collective wisdom of the faculty
in discharging the concomitant re-
sponsibility.”

In response to an inquiry from the
editors of the Ring-tum Phi, Presi-
dent Cole said the Board considered
the University’s admissions policy
at its meeting on July 25,

Said President Cole:

“It was noted that no provision
of the Charter, no provisions of
the By-laws and no resolution of
of the Board has established a
policy of discrimination among
qualified applicants for admission,

 

Traditionally, matters pertaining to
the qualifications of applicants for
admission have been entrusted to
the Faculty and its appropriate
committees, and the By-laws of
the University so provide.”

A faculty Committee on Admis-
sions at Washington and Lee, which
reports to the general faculty, is
composed of nine professors from the
College and the School of Commerce
and Administration and four mem-
bers of the University’s administra-
tive staff.

Dr. Edward C. Atwood, Jr., dean
of students and professor of eco-
nomics, is chairman of the commit-
tee. Its members are:

Dr. C. Westbrook Barritt, profes-
sor of Romance languages; Dr. Syd-
ney M. B. Coulling, associate pro-
fessor of English; Mr. John M.
Gunn, Jr., assistant professor of
economics; Dr. Leonard E. Jarrard,
associate professor of psychology;

 

Dr. William A. Jenks, professor of
history; Mr. John K. Jennings, as-
sistant professor of journalism; Dr.
Cecil D. Jones, associate professor
of fine arts; Mr. Henry L. Raven-
horst, associate professor of engi-
neering; Dr. Edgar W. Spencer, pro-
fessor of geology; Associate Dean of
Students James D. Farrar, director
of admissions; Assistant Dean of Stu-
dents Lewis G. John, director of
financial aid; and Dean, Emeritus,

Local Deities Called On the Carpet

By JOHN KIRKLEY

Let’s test a few idols.

Such as University Assemblies;
most of them are quite dull and
trite: it is amazing that gentlemen
with Ph.D.’s should speak so long
and say so little. The first really
interesting idea to come up in the
past several years is the suggestion
to create a Lee College in the hills—
it would be better if this were to be
a girl’s school. That way our life
around here would be more natural
and realistic. The whole monastic,
ascetic tradition (which did keep
scholasticism alive during Dark and
Middle Ages), on which some of our
current academic ideas are still
based, was, after all, a bit per-
verted—bald men communing pri-
vately each with himself in his own
cold little cell—and with Deity.

And how about homework and
discipline? It is most probably
true that man is a problem-solv-
ing and goal-striving animal and
that one should boldly confront
problems which face him and use
reason to figure out what is best
to do and should then do it. But
this is discipline for a purpose. But

is this what Washington and Lee

is trying to teach us? Or is the
emphasis on the mere acquisition
of factual knowledge? Does the
mere possession of factual knowl--
edge help us to sove problems?
Such emphasis is frustrating for
one can never know everything.
All our decisions must be based on
incomplete knowledge, and in-
complete experience furthermore;
we can never be sure that what
we decide to do is right, but must
we not do our best anyway and
accept the consequences of our ac-
tion?

Does the weighing down of the
students with great time burdens di-
rected towards the acquisition of
knowledge help them at all? And can
teachers conscientiously assign more
than eight out-of-class hours work
per week per course? Because if
students have to lose sleep to do
their homework, they become tired
then ennervated then frustrated
then sickly, narrow, easily irritated,
ete. And if all our time is filled up
by mere assignments, how are we to
do extra work in those few subjects
which might interest or excite us?

And what about conventional
dress, the speaking tradition,

 

spirit, fraternities, and the Honor
System? Here the whole empha-
sis is on sameness, on developing
a smooth well-ordered, machine-
like society in which persons slide
easily by one another without
passion or excitement or discom-
comfort, like marbles in oil. Are
not all these institutionalizations of
what .might .have once ..meant
something to certain individuals
asking us to accept as our own the
ideas and forms and ways of liv-
ing accepted by others?

Do not these, like Christianity,
offer us a system or way of life and
ask us to accept it on faita? And
if we accept them on faith are we
not giving up our right to determine
our lives according to our own
choices? And, after all, are not all
these old traditions excruciatingly
middle class? But then, from all I
hear, we students are as dully con-
servative and bourgeois as the school
we attend and its Board of Trustees.

Well, I guess that is enough for
now. It always pains me somewhat
to come down from House Mountain
where the air is pure and the colors
lovely to dwell for a short time in

‘Paper Party’ Replaces University, Says Freshman;
Letter From Jock X. Gridder Cuts Lack Of Spirit

Tuesday, October 20, 1964| pendents combine behind the edi-| The football stadium sounds not un-

We all heartily congratulate the
editorial staff of the Ring-tum Phi
for their conquest of the clique sys-
tem on the Washington and Lee
campus. In the freshman Executive
Committee elections, the big party
comprised of nine of the houses in
Lexington was shown that it can
no longer control the offices, officers,
and elections that exist here. At last
“the two percent” that have habitu-
ally controlled student policies have
been vanquished, like many other
political machines that have exist-
ed in the United States such as

the Tweed Ring of New York.

Last week nine of the fraternities)
at W&L united to form the Univer-|
sity Party to obtain the election!
of the best men into offices on this
campus. This corrupt group support-
ed one of the four leading candi-
dates as nominated by the Ring-
tum Phi initiated “non-partisan,”
“non-biased,” preferential primary.
After this primary the top six con-
tenders were named as the obvi-
ous choices as candidates for the
freshman Executive Committee of-
fice by the Ring-tum Phi,

Within seven days, during which
the University Party was formed
and gave its support to one of those
candidates, the Ring-tum Phi mi-

Thank you O Ring-tum Phi for
freeing us of this corrupt political
machinery and insuring your omni-
present control of all campus elec-
tions from here to eternity. At least
you have abolished a fraternity con-
trolled political system by graciously
offering yourselves to take the place
of the onetime all powerful two per

puses’ past politics.

Sincerely yours,
STEVE MEIXNER

Dear Sir:

“What is spirit?”—‘Spirit is con-
tagious, sir!” This is a vocal drill
for one of the fraternities on the
W&L campus, and, as seen at the
last two home football games, it
seems to hold true. Realizing that
there have been a multitude of ar-
ticles and letters to the editor con-
cerning spirit I still thought it in
the best interest of all that what
follows be written

Freshmen at Washington and Lee
have been a part of the school ap-
proximately nine weks, and so are
unfamiliar with the total outlook at
this institution. They have not as
yet been able to grasp the meaning
of four years ahead of them—they
wear a coat and tie only because
their elders tell them that it’s the
thing to do, they keep on the side-
walks for the same reason, and the
Honor System is maintained through
fear, and the novelty of the Idea

In my estimation freshmen ean
feel no real spirit, for they have not
been told that everyone cheers at the
football or basketball games—mainly |
no one does. It seems odd|
that a school so bound by the tra-
ditions of honor, gentlemanly con-
duct, and self-government should!
fail so miserably in arousing any/
boisetrous voeal support. As stated |
before, we are one, a body of minds, |
grouped together in an institution,
which grounds itself on pride, and
personal initiative. Why, if we hold
our place with the “firsts” in Amer-/
iean education, can we not harness!
some Of our pride to our own gain’

 

because

like a morgue on Saturday after-
noons (save a small group at the
West end, consistently outnumbered
10 to 1, which makes enough racket
for their own squad to put W&L to
shame).

What brings our lack of spirit?
Is it that there can be no drinking
at the games (that is where the
blame usually falls). Is it that the
spectators venture to the stands
just to see TD's rolled up for or
against us, and are oblivious to the
actual play itself? Perhaps one could
well say that the student body has
no confidence in the eleven men on
the field at any one time. It seems
apparent that the viewers of the
game at Washington and Lee take
the action on the field for granted,
and only attend the games for lack
of something better to do.

Having played football for two
years at Washington and Lee I can
appreciate the effort that goes into
every game. I have stood at the
sidelines in uniform and have heard
the silence behind me, as though
the contest was being held in the
the midst of a Wilderness. A team
should, in many ways, play both as
a unit and for itself. But the loneli-
ness facing the W&L squad by lack
of support is both unnecessary and
completely ridiculous

The student body stands up at
the kickoffs, yes, but only from
the pressure of social convention,
and because one sitting down at the
time could not see anything but reas
I firmly believe that everyone

W&L Booters Down King College,

General Errors

-()

WEL Blanked ‘By Hampden- Syduey, 21-0

Costly In Loss

By JAMES CROTHERS

Two fumbles and a Hampden-
Sydney interception led Saturday to
all three Tiger scores as Washing-
ton and Lee dropped its third
straight contest and fourth of five
this season.

The Generals’ 21-0 loss to the visi-
tors this weekend extended W&lL’s
scoreless streak to 13 fruitless quar-
ters. The losers controlled play, es-
pecially, during the second half, and
stayed even in the battle of statistics,
However Washington and Lee’s in-
ability to move the pigskin within
the Tiger 15-yard line continued to
to plague W&L.

Lipscomb Scores Two

Hampden-Sydney’s junior quarter-
back Whitey Lipscomb scored the
Tiger’s two second quarter tallies
with sneaks. The first score came
early in the second stanza when a
General fumble gave the visitors
an opportunity on the W&L 27.

After Lipscomb’s score and Ty
Tysinger’s PAT, General signal
caller Larry Craig had an aerial

session again on the W&L 28. Lips-

comb and Tysinger again couplede_-

for the seven points to put Hamp-|,
den-Sydney ahead at halftime, 14-0.
WA&L Drive Fails

The third quarter featured a sus-|
tained W&L drive which fell short

as the Tigers defense stiffened on
their 4-yard line. The Generals
forced the Tigers to punt, but

on the first series of downs Craig) 0%

dropped back to pass from his own
12, his arm was hit and Hampden-
Sydney recovered on the W&L
four-yard line. George Summers
scored for the Tigers with Tysinger
adding the twenty-first point to end
the day’s scoring.

Win A Few..

Lose A Few...

By TOM CARPENTER
Tuesday Sports Columnist

Year after year the football team
at W&L, whether good or bad, at-
tracts the greatest amount of stu-
dent attention of all the athletic
clubs during the fall months. This
season in particular the football
team has given the students very
little reason to cheer, yet the at-
tendance at the first two games
has been an increase over the at-
tendance at the first two games last
year. As a matter of fact, the size

of the crowd at Saturday’s game

was downright astonishing.

The soccer team, on the other
hand, has been having a fantastic
season and has drawn very sparse
crowds. Of course, the soccer team
is not blessed with the best facilities
with respect to their playing field.
Joe Lyles’ boys play on the base-
ball field, which is more rock than
turf. The stands are less than ade-
quate because they are a fairly good
distance away from the field, being
placed there for the primary pur-
pose of providing a resting place for
baseball fans.

Seats Needed

This lack of seating facilities tends} -
to prohibit spectators from attend-
ing the games. It's a funny thing
about the average American specta-
tor; he likes to have a place to rest
his weary feet while he spectates.

It seems to me that the University
should do something to rectify the
situation, even though the best so-

your thoughts. If

 

lution may entail the expenditure of
a goodly sum of money. This solu-
tion is to build a field for the sole
use of the soccer team.

There is enough unused land in
the vicinity of the baseball field
that a grade A soccer field is defi-
nitely not out of the question. It
is a shame that with a soccer team
as good as the one at W&L this
season no one attends the games
because the facilities for players and
spectators alike are just plain lousy.

Equal Time fer Booters

The Civil Rights Bill makes every-
one equal and politicians are given
equal time on television. Let's give
the soecer players facilities equal
to those which we give the football
club. They are definitely deserving
of it.

It is degrading to Washington and
Lee as a University to have a soccer
team that stands an excellent chance
to win the State title and that has as
a member an All-American candi-
date like Dave Redmond and yet
doesn’t even have its own field. This
situation demands correction in or-
der that the students will feel free
to come watch a truly good team at
work.

W&L Harriers Beat C.U.
Up Record To 4-1

Washington and Lee’s cross-coun-
try team brought its record to four
victories against one defeat as the
Generals defeated Catholic Univer-
sity of Washington, 20-41.

Running on Catholic’s 3.1 mile
course, the harriers managed
win six of the first seven places.
A Catholic runner took first place
in 16:08 minutes, setting a new
course record. Andy Kilpatrick fin-
ished second, and Lee Johnson third,
for the Generals with times of 16:24
and 16:26 respectively. W&L took
the next four places with only 13
seconds separating the first six W&L
runners.

Southern Collegian was unable to

Henry & Shinkle Score As

Generals Record 6th Win

The Washington and Lee soccer team continued its unde-
feated and untied pace shutting out King College, 3-0, at Bris-
tol, Tennessee Oct. 23 for its sixth victory.

After a scorless first quarter, Brad Shinkle tallied the first
W&L goal in about eight minutes into the second quarter.
Shinkle’s goal came on a pass from John Van Bork about 20

 

Frosh Gridders Lose, 3-0
Staunton Military Wins On
Second Quarter Field Goal

By DAVE DOUGHERTY

The Hilltoppers of Staunton Mili-
tary Academy, a perennial prep titan
in the South, protected a thin lead
provided by the 30-yard field goal
of Dick Milkerson to down the up-
start Washington and Lee freshmen,
3-0, last Friday.

Staunton, who had previously tied
national powerhouse Bordentown
Military Academy of New Jersey in
a 0-0 bout, was paced by an enor-
mous line anchored by 225 pound
middle guard Bill Scheib. The Hill-
topper line stymied all General ef-
forts as it concentrated on the hard
running General fullback Bill Me-
David as the key of the W&L of-

In the only scoring thrust of the
afternoon, Staunton recovered an
Andy Bloom fumble on the General
46 yard line, and through the pass-
ing hook-ups of quarterbacks Jim
Paldin and Ralph Spulock with
their fancy end Charles Blackburn,
the Hilltoppers moved to the General
12. Here the revived W&L bulwark
stiffened and repeatedly slapped
down the cadets on the vital series.
On fourth down, after being per-
fectly set-up at midfield with a
third down run, Melkerson stood
just behind the 20 and split the
uprights with his boot from place-
ment.

McDavid led the W&L charges to
several scoring opportunities, but in
each instance the mammoth Staun-
ton defense repelled the Brigadiers.
On one occasion Washington and Lee
drove into Staunton territory only
to have a stray aerial intercepted
by Blackburn on the 36 and returned
to the W&L 12. The second half was
not quite as eventful as the Gen-
erals managed only two first downs
in crossing the midfield stripe only
once.

out. Center forward Tim
in six minutes in the third quarter
on another pass from John Van
Bork. Henry also tallied the final
W&L goal on an assist from left
halfback Bruce Jackson near the
end of the third quarter.

King College’s only real scoring
threat came at the start of the game,
but goalie Bob Larus handled all
scoring attempts. It was an easy
day for Larus who had to handle
only six scoring chances the entire
game whereas W&L had 21 scoring
attempts.

Defense Stars

The defensive team of Howard
Busse, Dave Redman, and All-
American candidate Pete Preston
once again thwarted the opposition’s
scoring threat. This unit has allow-
ed only four goals in 6 games while
the Generals’ offense has scored 18
goals in six games for an average of
3 goals per game.

Center halfback Jim Walter played
an outstanding game for King Col-
lege. The King College coach praised
the efforts of W&L players Dave
Kirkpatrick, right inside and Brad
Shinkle, center forward Tim
Henry, and right wing John Van
Bork. Halfbacks Bruce Jackson and
Fred Skinner turned in an out-
standing defensive game.

Team Is Ready

Coach Lyles said, “The difference
in this year and last year is the
experience of the first team, the
team is mentally and physically
ready, and the team wants to go
all the way if possible. The dedica-
tion is the best of any University
team.”

sity is undefeated in the northern

ference and its team is composed

W&L has hired coaches for that

the job would be appreciated, or

1120 Parents Attend Tenth Parents’ Weekend

 

Goldwater
In Student

By LARRY MEEKS
Managing Editor

The final results of Wednesday's
presidential straw vote gave Re-
publican nominee Barry Goldwater
58.0 per cent of the 760 votes cast
in the election. This is only a drop
of one per cent from the 50 per cent
showing he made in the Ring-tum
Phi straw poll earlier this month.

President Johnson received 404
per cent of Wednesday's poll in
which 760 students voted. This
number represents approximately
60 per cent of the student body
and an increase of 28 votes cast
over the poll conducted earlier this
month.

Goldwater made his strongest
showing in the Law School vote
which gave him 65 per cent of the
total votes cast from the Law School;
the final tally was 54 for Goldwater
and 29 for Johnson.

Goldwater's weakest showing
was in the junior class in which
he received 55.5 per cent of the
117 votes cast. He received 55.7
per cent of the sophomore class
votes and 60.8 per cent of the
senior class vote.

The biggest participation was on
the part of the freshmen with 283
of the freshmen voting. In the fresh-
man class Goldwater received 604
per cent of the votes cast.

In addition to the votes for Gold-
water and Johnson there were four
abstentions, one vote for Gov.
Scranton, one for Adlai Stevenson,
two votes for Gov. George Wallace
of Alabama, and one vote for both
Senator Harry F. Byrd and Walter
Judd

Hollins

In a mock election held yesterday

forces again came out victorious,
with a 56-to-44 percentage lead
over LBJ. Although the faculty
voteed 90 per cent for LBJ, the
senior class 52 per cent, and the
junior class 50 per cent, the fresh-
men and sophomore classes were
sufficiently solid behind Goldwater
to carry the election.

Of 249 students polled by the Tu-
lane Hullabaloo, 124 came out for
Johnson and 124 for Goldwater.

Faculty Lectures and Debate
Are Scheduled For Tonight

Atwood, Kulp,
Gilliam Speak
At ODK Forum

The ODK Leadership Forum,
which met last night in the Com-
mons, discussed the announcement
made by President Fred C. Cole
that Washington and Lee will lower
racial barriers in admissions policy.

Steve Smith, President of the lo-
cal ODK chapter, initiated the meet-
ing by stating that, through the dis-
cussion of the integration state-
ment with student leaders, it was
hoped that a clearer understanding
of what the statement meant would
be gained.

Jim Kulp, Student Body President,
made a brief address in which he
exhorted student leaders to accept
the responsibility and trust which
has been given them by their con-
temporaries.

Kulp stated that the students
present had been failing in two re-
spects: First, in the area of conven-
tional dress, he stated that student
leaders should exhibit a more lively
pride in maintaining the spirit of
this tradition. Second, he stated that
during Homecomings the student
body as a whole should be urged
to show the alumni that we do sup-
port the school and that we do pos-
sess a school spirit.

Kulp went on to say that a re-
quest be made to the faculty in an
attempt to get shortened Saturday
classes before the football game dur-
ing Homecomings weekend.

In reference to the integration
statement, he stated that the stu-
dents must aid in the implimenta-
tion of the integration policy, no
matter what the individual's per-

sonal feelings were

Dean Atwood acted as spokesman
for the administration, with the aid
of Dean Frank Gilliam and mem-
bers of the Admissions Committee,

Welcome Parents

It’s unfortunate, parents, that your being sandwiched be-
tween a combo weekend and the Southern Collegian won’t
allow you to get a complete look at Wé&L, but at least you'll
have a chance to see the other aspects of our daily life here.
We think that you'll like what you see. You'll see, for instance,
that your son’s wheat jeans are only worn for IM football
games; that, though he’s not writing, he has a good excuse
in that he has been working so hard; that all the boys from
the fraternity are true gentlemen; that your son is safe in the
hands of a competent medical staff; and that the speaking
traditions has done wonders for your son who was always so
shy and had trouble meeting people. We are proud that
you will have a chance to see all these things first hand, and
we know that it will be a comfort to you to learn that the
Ring-tum Phi staff is just a bunch of muck rakers. K. O. M.

How Important Is Your Vote?

This editorial is directed to those juniors, seniors, faculty
members, and parents who are presently asking themselves
the question, “How important is one vote?”

Tracing a string of events through history, Repre-
sentative Frank Thompson (Democrat—New Jersey)
says that one vote cast in 1843 has led to the nomina-
of the two major candidates for president this year.

As Thompson outlined it in a news release yester-
day, the vote cast in 1843 by Henry Shoemaker, a
farmhand in DeKalb County, Indiana, broke a tie and
elected one Madison Marsh to the Indiana State Leg-
islature.

In those days United States Senators were elected
by state legislatures and the Indiana Legislature had
deadlocked on five ballot before the newly elected
Marsh switched and broke the tie, sending Edward A.
Hannegan to the United States Senate.

Two years later, congress voted on the admittance

of Texas to the union. The Senate deadlocked 26 to 26.
Then Hannegan switched his vote, and Texas, the
home of Lyndon B. Johnson, entered the union.
In 1846 the Senate again deadlocked, this time on
President James K. Polk’s call for a declaration of war
against Mexico, and again it was Hannegan who broke
the tie. Out of the war thus declared the United States
acquired the territory that includes the present state
of Arizona, home of Senator Barry Goldwater.

Thompson used the example of Henry Shoe-
maker’s vote to underscore the importance of each
American’s voting on election day.

“The ballot he casts is his birthright,”’ says Thomp-
son. “He who does not exercise it does himself, his
community and his nation a disservice.”

(Associated Press)
x *

This election year witnesses the increase of five million
potential voters over 1960. This means that there should be
a record turnout at the polls, with, hopefully, at least five
million more votes cast in 1964 that the 68 million that were
cast in 1960.

Our fear is that those voters who lean to Johnson will rest
on the laurels of the Gallup and Harris polls and will stay
home on election day. Their complacence, if widespread, could
turn a rout into a victory for the Goldwater forces.

Lyndon B. Johnson has not yet been re-elected to the pres-
idency; he will not be re-elected if Johnson supporters main-
tain an apathetic attitude towards voting on November 3.

No matter who your personal preference is, how-
ever; the expression of political concern by voting is a
privilege that must be exercised. That it should be exer-
cised in 1964 is of particular import; the implications
and consequences of the election in 1964 are as signifi-
cant as those of any election since 1860.

Furthermore, it is the duty of every American citizen,
of whatever political conviction, responsible and caring enough
to classify himself as such to vote. Don’t let apathy or com-
plancence squelch your voice and vote in the election of 1964.

Dear Editor

You have asked for the election
of Johnson primarily on the basis
of his “talents” and his domestic
success in the past 10 months. How-
ever, Americans prefer men of prin-
ciple and character who do not
change their spots to suit the season.
Att a time when we need a strong
man to meet the threat of com-
munists, you want us to take a
Johnson who may be the first cross
between a chameleon and a snake.

Democratic propaganda accuses
Goldwarter of changing his position
on the issues, yet it appears that
Johnson is the one who has changed

 

on every subject EXCEPT BIG
GOVERNMENT. Read what Joseph
L. Rauh, Jr., a founder and leader
of the A.D.A. said about Johnson
just a year ago when Lyndon John-
son was the Vice President:

Pale Horse And

By JAMES JENNINGS

Parent's weekend is here and
very few people are thinking about

a full schedule of events which will
probably result in a slow weekend
at the State and the Lyric. For those
who might have nothing to do, how-
ever, let me point out that the
Beatles are in town in “A Hard Day’s
Night.” Since I reviewed this movie
in this column three weeks ago, I
add any further comments here ex-
cept to remind you that Time maga-
zine gave the Beatles a favorable re-
view. "Nuf said.
Spanish Intrigue

The movie that I would like to
talk about is “Behold a Pale Horse”
which is playing at the State. This
flick, which is composed of a lit-
tle imagery, a little action, and some
drama, is best described as interest-
ing. It is set in France and Spain
twenty years after the Spanish Rev-
olution. Gregory Peck as a Republi-
can at the age of fifty is in exile
in France but his mother is dying
in Spain. His best friend has been
killed by the Spanish Civil Guard
Captain, played by Anthony Quinn,
and a little boy, the dead man’s son,
has been sent to urge Peck to take
revenge on Quinn, Unfortunately,
twenty years does a lot to a man’s
physiology and attitude, and Peck
does not want to go. Just as he is
being convinced he must go, a priest
(Omar Shariff) brings complications
which point to the fact that he

should not go. The priest has his
own problem of should he, or should
he not, tell Peck not to go, and
Quinn is sitting in Spain wondering
if he will or will no go, and Peck

is certainly taking his time deciding
Yes, he goes. He and Quinn have a

The whole flick hinges on a pres-

In my opinion the A.D.A. and
Walter Reuther forced the Demo-
crats and Lyndon Johnson to nomi-
nate Hubert Humphrey because they
do not ‘trust Johnson.

Can you see Johnson or Hum-
phrey ‘taking a TOUGH stand
against the grim communists from
Moscow or Peking? Think it over.
Our number one problem is com-
munism and all the domestic success
based on more spending and BIG
government in Washington aren’t
going to cause the communists to

Dear Editor:

In the editorial column of the
October 20 Ring-tum Phi was ex-
pressed an alarming lack of under-
standing of Senator Goldwater’s po-
sition on foreign policy. It is alleged
that Goldwater is avoiding the for-
eign policy issue in this campaign.

I would like to refer your editor
to Goldwater’s major book, Why
Not Victory?. Adidtionally, in his
televised response ‘to Johnson’s
“emergency” speech, Goldwater out-
lined a three point program that he
would follow as President. I would
also like to refer your editor to most
of Goldwater’s campaign speeches,
for the imminent threat of commun-
ism and his ideas to combat it are
inherent elements of his appeal.

However, I would like to ask your
editor what Johnson’s concept of
foreign policy is. His stand on this

 

Johnson Stand Brings Goldwater Response

issue consists of glittering general-
ities which are inherently meaning-
less. The most revealing statement
of his is, “Let us continue.” Con-
tinue what? Continue killing our
men in a war which this adminis-
tration does not intend to win? Con-
tinue trading with the enemy and
strengthening him militarily (Tito
has the fifth largest air force in the
world and greatly comprised of U.S.
planes which are more modern than
‘those which our men are using in
South Viet Nam)? Continue allow-
ing our alliances to rot and weaken?
Continue to throw billions of dollars
around the world in the vain hope
of buying friends? Continue permit-
ting an offensive military base ninety
miles from our shores?

The point of this election is that
we cannot and must not “continue,”
for we have to reverse a trend which
will be fatal to the American con-
cept of freedom unless a new pro-
gressive, rather than defeatist, pro-
gram is proposed and implemented.

Goldwater has such a program: 1.
We must rebuild our grand alliances;
2. We must recognize communism
as our enemy; 3. We must confront
with a policy of strength and reso-
lution. Elaboration on ‘these points
is avaliable in the text of Goldwater’s
October 21 television speech.

Thus we must not “continue” un-
less we desire national suicide. We
must reverse a horrifying trend by
chosing a man who has a program
rather than one who has a catchy
phrase.

| A freshman waddled up to me
earlier this week and, true to our
| great traditions, he Spoke First.
“Excuse me, Sir,” he said. “Might
| you have a few spare seconds to
| spend with someone such as 1?”

| At the time I was standing on a
| small rise of ground gazing to the
| west. In the distance I could see
famed House (pronounced “Hoose”)
Mountain and Hig Back pronounced
“Hog Back”) Mountain.

“Please, Sir, I need some academic
help and advice. I have to write a
paper and I really don’t know how
to go about it. Woe is ,to turn a
phrase, me. I mean I did very well
on my College Boards and all that,
but I don't know how to do any-
thing.”

So this freshman and I sat down
on the tepid turf and I began ex-|
plaining the who's and what's of
writing paper here the big
leagues

a in

First, I ascertained the title of his
projected tome. It was, “The Influ-
ence and Importance of Emily Dav-
ison in Woman Suffrage Movements
of the 19th Century.” He wanted

to get the paper out of the way so],

that he could devoted his full atten-
tion to the Big Little Date Book in
PE. 1

The first thing a good paper
quires, I told him is a fat introduc-

re.

tion. Onee you have composed a
really good one you can make a
copy and tuck it away somewhere
and then pull it out again at Paper
Time

Here .then, is a good model for
an introduction: “In the beginning
prefacing the start of the introduc-
tion of this paper, I shall endeavor
to try to make an attempt to pro-
mulgete and set for the pros, and
last but not least. the cons of this
important informative subject.”

(if happen to be writing
about a particular book, always say
that you “couldn't put it down” and
think it should be “required

for everyone.”)

tion of our paper. The best procedure
here is to repite the title in as many
different ways as you can think of.
And should the professor want foot-
notes, simply find some book with
a vaguely relevant title and then
put in an “ibid” or two at the bot-
tom of each page.

By now you have spent enough
of your good time, and you are ready
to wrap the package up. A rambling
repetition of the introduction to-
gether with some phrases from the
title will do nicely. A few “there-
fore’s” and “thus we can see's” can
be added for emphasis.

The freshman was most grateful
for my advice and instruction and he
soon was off to what is quaintly
known as “Dorm I” to begin the

paper.

 

the same time be questioned for its
refusal to make immediate an-
nouncement of its decision,

As this writer understands it, the
board decided then that there would
be no public announcement of the
policy; indeed, that even the pres-
ent student body and alumni would
not have been notified.

Why?

Reasons

Several alternative reasons present
themselves as possibilities. Perhaps
the board wanted to avoid contro-
versary, which would surely result
if a newspaper announcement of in-
tegration appeared. Perhaps the
board wanted to side-step inevit-
able clashes with racially preju-
diced alumni. Or perhaps the board's
decision was only a_ half-hearted
one, token compliance with what it
finally saw as an imperative of the
respectable educational institution.

Whatever the reason or reasons for
the board's refusal to publicize its
decision, the fact of this refusal is
a real pity. The decision to inte-
grate was a good one, and it took
courage; but the cautious whisper
with which the board notified only
those people who had to know de-
tracts considerably from its image.

Not Too Harsh

How much better it would have
been had the board proudly released
its information to the news media!
How much more respect one could
feel for the board had they urged
the application of Negro students!

But we mustn't be too harsh with
the board. The very fact that they
opened the way for W&L to call
itself a 20th Century educational
institution is worth the highest
praise. And we must admit that,
when the reality of W&L’s extreme
conservatism is taken into consider-
ation, the board's decision—unan-

Booters After 7th Win;
Frosh Defeated At AMA

Varsity Might
Get NCAA Bid

By LOCK HANDLEY

When W&L’s unbeaten soccer
team goes against American Uni-
versity tomorrow, they will be risk-
ing not only their perfect 6-0 record,
but also a possible NCAA tourna-
ment berth.

According to Coach Joe Lyles, his
booters are currently considered the
favorites to represent the South at
the NCAA College Division cham-
pionships, to be held November 20
and 21 at Tufts University in Med-
ford, Mass. The Generals are rated
ahead of such traditional power-
houses as North Carolina, David-
son, and Duke.

A loss to American would ser-
iously damage the booters’ chances
for the nod, and the Eagles are
capable of an upset. They come into
tomorrow’s game with a 2-2 record,
having lost to powerful Baltimore
and Georgetown and beaten Gallau-
det and Loyola.

General fortunes tomorrow will
depend largely on the condition of
star forward Wes Horner, sidelined
by an injured hip for the game
against King College last Friday.
. If the booters get by American,

they will have to beat strong Roa-
noke College and defending state
champion Virginia to justify a tour-
nament bid. Should they receive the
selection committee’s nod, they will
be the first W&L team to go to
an NCAA tournament since one of
the Bob Spessard-led basketball
squads of the late thirties, according
to Athletic Director Cy Twombly.

Asked his opinion of how the Gen-
eral booters would fare in such a
meet, Coach Lyles said that he
thinks his team is capable of beat-
ing any team in the country on a
given day, “if we play our best game
and get our share of the breaks.”

Perez Gets 2
To Pace AMA

By LUKE CROSLAND

The Augusta Military Academy
soccer team, for the second time
this season, defeated the Washington
and Lee freshmen booters 3-1
Wednesday afternoon at Staunton.
This defeat brought the frosh rec-
ord to 1-3.

Although W&L came out on the
short end of the score, the game was
a close and hard-fought battle. Af-
ter a scoreless first quarter Manuel
Perez, one of the two highly rated
Mexicans on the Augusta squad,
broke through the usually staunch
defense and rifled a shot into the
nets.

W&L ‘then took to the attack, but
even though they consistently
threatened to score, the Augusta
goalie did a fine job of thwarting
their efforts. In the third quarter,
Perez scored again on the same
pattern that worked successfully
in the first half for the cadets and
Augusta held a 2-0 lead going into
the final stanza.

The fourth quarter saw the young
, booters finally break into the scoring
column. With time running out, Dave
Greenia put a heavy foot into the
ball. The long kick struck an Augus-
ta player and rebounded into the
Augusta goal, giving W&L their
first tally. However, the Augusta
squad drove down the field and
scored once more as the game ended.

The baby Generals played well,
but were unable to score as they
failed to capitalize on many oppor-
tunities. Charlie Harrold and Rich-
ards Burrough, playing center half-
back and left fullback respectively,
led the W&L defense. The frosh
will try to avenge their last three
losses in a home encounter with the
freshmen of Lynchburg College next
Friday.

 

 

Harriers In Triangular Meet

Washington and Lee’s cross-coun-
try team will play host to American
and Richmond Universities in a tri-
angular Parents’ Weekend meet at
2:15 tomorrow.

Coach Dick Miller anticipates that
the biggest challenge to General su-
premacy in the meet will some from
American, a team which W&L’s
harriers barely edged out last year.
Richmond should not be counted
out, however, for although the

Spiders have a poor won-lost,
record, most of their defeats have
| come at the hands of extreme-
ly tough opposition. And Richmond's
| Ronnie Jones is expected to be the
fastest man in ‘tomorrow's race, hav-
ing finished first in meets with
cross-country powers such as
Bridgewater and VMI.

Nevertheless, Coach Miller relies
on W&L’s depth to give the Gen-
erals a victory.

Confusion Reigns
In Golf Finals

By JOHN BEAGLE

Intramural golf should be long
over by now, but this is not the
case as confusion and weather have
delayed it considerably. Phi Delt
practically eliminated itself by vir-
tue of its forfeit to Sigma Chi. This
leaves Sigma Chi, ZBT and Sigma
Nu still in contention.

However, ZBT has beaten Sigma
Chi, and Sigma Nu has beaten ZBT;
while to make the confusion com-
plete, Sigma Chi claims Sigma Nu
forfeited to them. Confusing, isn’t
it? If that be the case, look for a
Sigma Chi victory.

In wrestling, last year’s fourth
place finisher Beta started off will
by beating the Phi Phi’s, 35-5, but
then lost to the Phi Psi’s. SAE, which
had earlier defeated defending
champ KA, lost to Phi Gam. Delt
won by forfeit over Kappa Sigma
after having lost to Sigma Chi by
forfeit.

SPE won both its matches last
week by beating Lambda Chi and
DU. Sigma Chi beat Kappa Sig, 35-
5, while ZBT won over PiKA, 30-5,
and Phi Kap beat Phi Delt, 25-8.
Ranking here: 1) Sigma Chi, 2) Phi
Gam, 3) Phi Psi, 4) SPE.

The intramural swimming meet
was held this week with the pre-
liminaries on Tuesday night and
the diving on Wednesday. Heading
into last night’s finals SAE led with
55% points followed by Sigma Chi
with 45, Beta 34, Delt 29, KA 20,
and Phi Kap 18.

Leading their teams into the finals
were Denman of SAE, Edwards of
Phi Gam, Huston of KA, and Clinard
of Beta...each qualifying first in
two events. Final results will appear
next week.

Bowling began this last Tuesday
and IM football continued during
the week.

W&L Gridders Face Bridgewater;
Generals Look For First Score

fresh from a week’s layoff.

Against the only common op-

succumbed 21-0.

Injuries Hamper Generals
Two key injuries may hamper
the Generals’ attack, but McLaugh-
lin felt that neither were potential-
ly serious. End Curt Jennigan in-
jured his back in dummy scrimmage
Monday, and his condition is quest-
ionable. Center Chuck Long, in-
jured in last week’s loss to Hamp-
den-Sydney, has been hampered by
a bad knee all week.

On the bright side, running back
Harry Brookby, who has been out
for several weeks with a shoulder
injury, is fully recovered and ex-
pected to play.

Benson Doubtful

There is a chance that the Eagles
starting quarterback, Jim Benson,
who suffered a shoulder injury sev-
eral weeks ago, will not start. Ben-
son, a good passer is a serious threat
on the roll out and the pass-run
option.

McLaughlin expressed a hope that
the Generals’ running attack would
operate as well as it did in the
second half of the Hampden-Syd-
ney game when the Generals put
together several drives but were un-
able to score.

Players Praised

Several players received praise for
their play last week. Middle guard
Charlie Myers, who led the team in
tackles, and tackle Stark Sydnor
were cited for their defensive work.
Fullback John Anthony and guard
Jay Bowersox were outstanding on
offense.

Parents’ Crowd
Last Weekend
Biggest Ever

Eleven hundred parents were in
Lexington last weekend for
tenth annual Parents’ Weekend
sponsored by the University and
the Parents’ Advisory Council.

Parents’ Weekend is designed to
give the parents of W&L students
a better understanding of what goes
into an education at Washington
and Lee. The various programs pre-
sented during the two-day period il-
lustrate different aspects of the Uni-
versity.

In the area of athletics there was
a freshman football game with Fork
Union Friday afternoon; a cross-
country meet, a varsity football game
with Bridgewater, and a Soccer
game with American University, all
Saturday afternoon.

The faculty offered a number of
programs Friday afternoon and

night. Dr. David L. Meyer spoke at’———____——

the weekly chemistry —, = |
Milton Colvin and Professor

derdeveloped Countries.” “In the| |
Shadow of the Soviet Union; Rus-
sia’s Neighboring Nations” was the
- of discussion by Professor O.

Robert Penn Warren Visits W&L
For Poetry Readings and Lecture
On Pulitzer Prize Winning Novel

One of the amazing things to note
about Robert Penn Warren is his
literary versatility. Not only does
he write prose fiction and edit, he is
also a poet of no small repute. He
received his second Pulitzer Prize
in 1958 for his collection, Promises:
Pomes 1954 to 1956. This publication
of Warren’s also receieved the Na-
ational Book Award and the Edna
St. Vincent Millay Award of the
Poetry Society of America. He is
especially fond of writing long nar-
rative poems, of which “You, Emper-
or, and Others” is one of the more
famous.

Besides a number of well-known
novels such a World Enough and
Time, Night Rider, and The Cave,
Warren has published two very in-
fluential studies on social problems.
Segregation: The Inner Conflict in
the South was published in 1956 and
The Legacy of the Civil War in 1960.
Warren now teaches at Yale Univer-
sity.

Thursday night, November 5, at
8:15 p.m. in duPont Auditorium, Dr.
Warren will read from his poems.
Friday afternoon he will lecture in
duPont on the origins and meta-
morphosis of All the King’s Men.
This lecture will be held at 2:30 p.m.

Friday evening at 8:15 in duPont
there will be a reading of portions
of Warren's poem, Brother to Dra-
gons: A Tale in Verse and Voices.
Dr. Jones, Mr. Evans, Mrs. G. W.
Ray, Dr. Duvall and Mr. Boatwright
will be the readers. The reading
will be followed by a discussion led
by Warren.

The Glasgow Endowment pro-
gram was created under a legacy to
Washington and Lee from the late
Arthur Graham Glasgow, an engi-
neer and honorary alumnus of the

| university. Mr. Glasgow died in 1955.

His will directed that income from
to Washington and Lee
be known as the “Arthur and Mar-
garet Glasgow Endowment” and
that it be used to “promote the arts
of expression by tongue and pen.’

The Presidential Election

Another election has come, failed to break
through the impenetrable Washington and
Lee apathy, and gone. This student body, al-
though the majority are committed to the
candidate who should lose by a landslide, re-
mained undisturbed by the campaign. Student
inertia was in marked contrast to the efforts
of the faculty, which was probably the most
active element in this county during the en-
tire campaign. If the relative activity of Gold-
water’s and Johnson’s supporters in this area
is any key, the Republican hope that the
Democratic majority would stay home today is
unfounded.

America has had its choice and has, we
hope, picked Lyndon Johnson as the unde-
niably best qualified candidate for president.
The echo of the rout should be ringing in
Republicans ears for a long time. However,
Barry Goldwater, though he may be badly
defeated by the President, has definitely had
an effect on American politics. He has forced
the President to become a little more conserva-
tive than any other candidate could have done.
By calling attention to the danger of increas-
ing centralization Goldwater has performed a
valuable service to the country.

For his part President Johnson has also
proved something. Even if he should lose the
election, the enthusiasm Johnson aroused in
the northern cities ought to wipe out forever
the prejudice which party leaders have always
had against nominating a southerner for presi-
dent. Johnson, whose long career has been
largely devoted to overcoming sectionalism in
the legislature, has made greater strides toward
national unity in his popular appearances than
he ever could have by working behind the
scenes in the Senate. Not attempting to hard-
en his southern speaking voice or mannerisms,
Johnson has broken a very real barrier in the
same way President Kennedy broke another
barrier in 1960, without denying his back-
ground in any way.

The Republican Party faces a long road
back if Goldwater loses like the polls say he
will. The first step on the road will probably
be a revolt against the Goldwater conserva-
tives and a return to more traditional Re-
publican principles, which would be one of the
healthiest changes imaginable for America.
But the Grand Old Party will be fortunate
indeed if Goldwater’s seeming ill-fated can-
didacy has not ruined the careers of some of
the young moderates on whom the party’s
future rests, men such as Percy and Taft.
If Goldwater has dimmed the stars of men
such as these, it will indeed by an ironic blow
to Republicanism and to conservatism. For
this was the election in which a conservative
finally won the nomination and gave the
country a choice. But he was a conservative
unrepresentative of the best conservatives. He
was a conservative who failed to meet the chal.
lenge of the times. He was a conservative
who seemed determined to prove, not that
conservative methods could solve today’s prob.
lems, but that this country could blindly re-
turn to the grand old days of the last century.
As a critic of the liberal establishment Gold.
water was effective. But as a spokesman for a
conservative solution, he was a failure. His
frantic attack on immorality, his bitter slashes
at the President's character, were Goldwater's
own admissions that Goldwater conservatism
has proved inadequate for the twentieth cen-
tury.

Parents’ Weekend

The tenth annual Parents’ Weekend was
not only the biggest ever at Washington and
Lee, it was also one of the best organized. The
committee which planned the weekend, under
the direction of Dr. John Wise, is certainly
to be commended for this handling of a rec-
ord number of guests on the campus. Relative-
ly slight improvements in the administration
of the program this year made a big difference
over the weekend. But more than just run-
ning smoothly, Parents? Weekend was some-
what of a pleasant surprise for two reasons:
first, the fraternities put on an exceptionally
fine show for the parents, and second, the
football team came through with a very
satisfying first home victory of the season.

The Friday night faculty-student programs
once again proved the popularity of student
demonstrations, as the exhibition staged by
the debate team drew the heaviest attendance.
Repetition of debating as the top attraction
for the second year in a row must pose the
question to next year’s Parents?’ Weekend
Committee whether the number of student
participants in these Friday night programs
should be increased.

Next year’s committee will also face the
more serious problem of whether Parents”
Weekend has become, rather strangely, too
popular. In the last few years the number of
parents and guests attending the weekend has
approached an impossible overcrowding of
Lexington and of the campus. No ready so-
lution is available to this problem; to arrange
separate weekends for the parents of different
classes would place a heavy burden on profes-
sors and administration. To simply not invite
the parents of a particular class—say the
freshmen or seniors—would be an unfair re-
striction. Possibly there could be imposed a
restriction on the number of years a parent
could attend Parents’ Weekend. This might
not solve the problem next year, but would
cut down the number of attending guests
at least by the second year.

Lee’s Spirit Survives
(Reprointed from today’s Washington Post)

Washington and Lee University honored
the memory of both great Virginians in de-
ciding to open its doors to Negro students.
General Lee is buried on the campus in Lex-
ington, and the University still maintains the
last office he used when he served as president
of what was then Washington College. Some-
thing of Lee’s spirit plainly survives in the
University.

Before the Civil War, Robert E. Lee did
not deceive himself about the nature of slave-
ry. He regarded the peculiar institution as a
“moral and political evil—a greater evil to the
white race than to the black.” In 1865, after
he put his sword aside, Lee said, “T think it
is the duty of every citizen in the present con-
dition of the country to do all in his power
to aid in the restoration of peace and har-
mony and in no way oppose the policy of the
State or general government directed to that
object.”

So in contrast to Jefferson Davis—who
remained an irreconcilable mourner of the lost
cause——Lee gave his gifts to help build a new
South. Until his death in 1870, he was presi-
dent of Washington College. Certainly he
would have applauded his school’s decision to
conform with American practice by dropping
racial bars.

‘Freedom of Association’ at W &L

By LAMAR LAMB
Tuesday Columnist
Washington and Lee has finally
announced a policy which will in-
sure true freedom
of association at
this school, for it
is only when we
have a fully inte-
grated student
body and faculty
that we really be-
gin to talk of
“freedom of asso-
ciation.” Soon
Washington and
Lee students will
be free to associ-
ate with Negroes as equals. Soon
we will have the right, and the
opportunity, to accept or reject, like
or dislike, associate with or ignore
men who happen to be Negroes. This

is real freedom of association.
From time to time, this “freedom
of association” has been used as an
argument to support racial segre-
gation. In the sense that this argu-
ment has been used, it was entirely
wrong. It is true that at Washington
and Lee, because of its status as a
private school, we have had the
legal right to exclude people for
whatever reason we deem proper.
This does not mean, however, that

 

 

we have had the moral right to do
so. It has never been morally right
to use freedom of association to ex-
clude people for indefensible rea-
sons.

Washington and Lee has now pub-
licly recognized that there is no
moral justification for maintaining
a racially segregated society, no mat-
ter what the legal questions in-
volved. Society at large has recog-
nized that no one’s right to be
wrong about Negroes is such that it
can deny Negroes the right to equal
opportunities. Now Washington and
Lee has said that it wants to do its
part to insure to Negroes every pos-
sible opportunity consistent with the
rights of others. Washington and
Lee can be proud that it has used
its freedom to extend the associa-
tions of the student body instead of
immorally and unreasonably restrict-
ing them. Now we have the free-
dom to associate with whom we want.
Now some Negroes will have the

benefit of an education at Wash-
ington and Lee.
But there is another sense in

which Washington and Lee has now
fulfilled its legitimate function as a
university through its recent action.
With the acceptance of Negroes,
W&L is immeasurably broadening

 

its educational horizons. We are
producing leaders of American so-
ciety. Until now the men we have
been sending out have had no real
knowledge of one of the most im-
portant social problems facing our
nation. Soon our students will have
the opportunity to acquaint them-
selves first hand with Negroes and
their problems.

Not until we are personally and
intimately acquainted with Negroes
can we begin to understand either
the complexities of the problem or
the possible solutions. As one mem-
ber of the faculty recently pointed
out, only when we can personally
know Negroes as equals can we
understand even our own selves in
relation to them, much less society
at large.

So, soon W&L will be graduating
men who will at least have had a
chance to gain a significant under-
standing of race relations in con-
tempory society. Washington and
Lee can be proud of the stand it
has taken, and it can be proud of
the role it has now taken of helping
our society by building leaders who
will have a true understanding of
the worth and dignity of all human
beings, as well as a better under-
standing of themselves in relation
with other human beings.

dream. She was eligible, obiain-
able and unreluctant. You might
run into her anywhere; the drug
store, a hotel lobby, or a movie
theatre. She was not commonplace
by any means, because you were
instantly startled by her platinum
hair. bright red lips and excellent
figure. She was so American be-
cause she was what you saw in
your mind's eye just before you
fell asleep at nights or head the
word “bombshell.” In her twe Hol-
lywood marriages she gained fur-
ther affection from her fans by
choosing unromantic husbands
who could have lived next door

to anyone,

Women admired her because as
beautiful as she was. she had a heart
of gold. If she had oceasion to
sleep with your husband it was not
to break Up YOU Marriage but to
boost his ego, She may have used
her bedy ribaldly, but she was pure
in mind. Schulman describes her as
“The great All-American piece in
the white malo.”

The great question that arises
about Harlow is why, in the midst of
this country’s worst economic col-
laps .did the people queue up to
ee Jean Harlow in almost the same
number as they lined up fer soup?
There seemed to be a need for an

AU Downs Booters For W&L’s First Loss

Loss Could Stop
Playoff Invite

By BOB CARTER

Washington and Lee’s soc
cer team suffered its first de-
feat of the season Saturday
by losing to American Univer-
sity of Washington, 0-3. The

score was tied at 0-0 at the|
end of the first quarter with the!
Generals controlling the play. Early
in the second quarter American Uni-
versity scored on a kick from mid-
field to move out ahead 1-0.

fourth quarter.

late

The Generals were hampered by
a lack of team work, poor passing,
and bunching. American Univer-
sity was beating W&L to the ball.
The lack of teamwork and hustle
was probably due to many members
of the squad being frequently ab-
sent from practice during the past
week,

Fullback Dave Redmond was in-
jured in the second quarter with
a cut lip and had to be taken out.
Stitches were sequired to seal the
cut. Redmond remains a question

gave an early indication of the
strength which has propelled them
to the top of the Virginia Military
League as they struck savagely for
all of their points in the first quarter,
and then held on for a 20-0 victory
over the Washington and Lee fresh-
men.

A mere twelve seconds had
elapsed before FUMA had tacked
up their first tally of the afternoon
as Don Burtner gobbled up the
opening kick on his fifteen and cake-
walked into the Brigadier end zone.
The scamper was followed by Van-
Dean’s point from placement which
gave Fork Union a 7-0 advantage.

After Luke Crosland returned the}
kickoff to the W&L 35, the Baby|
Generals set up FUMA with a fum-
ble on the W&L 40. The defensive
unit, however, showed its mettle as
Strait Fairey and F. L. Wilson led

to punt into the W&L endzone. The
Brigadiers could not get untracked
on the offensive, and Rudd Smith
was forced to punt. Paul Fischette
promptly gathered in the high boot
and rambled to the thirteen and af-
ter two thrusts, Fischette bombed in
for the score from a yard out. Funk’s
attempt to pass for the conversion
was broken up.

Once again the Baby Generals
could not start a drive of their own,
and Fork Union began another

By TOM CARPENTER

Tuesday Sports Writer
The Washington and Lee football team continued its 1964
tradition by scoring only in the act of winning as the Generals
smothered the Bridgewater Eagles, 28-16, at home Saturday.

e Generals scored in only one

The big guns for the Generals were their reserve fullbacks,

*Tommy Sparks and Dan Manson.
| Sparks gained 67 yards in four car-
| ries, while Manson picked up 49
|yards in ten carries. Sparks’ big
play was his 46-yard touchdown
saunter, which broke the backs of
the visitors.

Sparks and Manson were subbing
for starter and leading ground
gainer John Anthony who reinjured
his ankle the only time he carried
| the ball against the Eagles.

Match TD's at Start

After about five minutes of play
had passed, the crowd settling down
to what appeared to be the begin-
ning of a high scoring ball game.
The first time the Eagles had the
ball they scored on a 29-yard pass
from Joe Marvel to Roger Saale. The
Generals then proceeded to match
Bridgewater's touchdown the first
time they got their hands on the
ball with Bill David getting the six
| by outmauevering the Eagle defense
on a 37-yard toss from Larry Craig.
| The Generals, however, were un-
|able to match the visitor’s extra
point as Craig was stopped short
The remainder of the half was a
standoff, giving the Eagles a 7-6
advantage for the second half kickoff.

Sparks Busts Eagles

The defense remained in command
until late in the third quarter when
Sparks burst off right tackle and
headed for the sidelines and end
zone. Bob Reading eliminated the
last man in Sparks’ path with a
bone-crushing block. Reading then
made a phenomenal grab of Bryant
Kendrick’s pass for the two-point
conversion, extricating the ball from
the hands of the defender. This
pushed the Brigade ahead, 14-0,

political and social oppression that
has developed square in the “main-
stream” of American life. Unfortu-
nately perhaps, the picture he paints
is a true one, and a tragic one.

Most of us are familiar with the
atrocities that have been a part of
the post-Civil War Southern racial
pattern—from lynchings to bomb-
ings to voter registration procedures.
What is more frightening, however,
is the extent the political, social, and
economic control that those who
wish to maintain such a society ex-
ercise over the whole state-wide
community in Mississippi. With only
a few changes here and there this
could be Alabama, Louisiana or
other deep-South states.

Dr. Silver carefully traces the re-
sults of the situation from his own
eye-witness account of the riots at
Ole Miss to his personal conversation
and correspondance with people
throughout the state on both sides
of the issue. He also proceeds firmly
to the heart of the matter, and
demonstrates for all to see that the
government of the State of Mississip-
pi, down to the county courthouse,
is dominated largely by the White
Citizens Council.

The atrocities which this alliance
produces are perhaps less sensational
but, in a way, more shocking and
repulsive. In short, those that dis-
agree are ostracized—even on oc-
casions to the point of physical vio-
lence. They consider it their “duty”
to encourage beatings of local Ne-
groes to refuse to play the quiet,
subservient role; to “weed out” those
faculty members at Ole Miss and
other institutions who dare give
their students more than one narrow
viewpoint; to work to defeat even a
student candidate for the editorship
of the campus newspaper whom they
dislike. Many of these policies ac-
tually originate in the White Citi-
zens Council, and find their way
into official policy through the Gov-
ernor’s office and the State Sover-
eignty Commission. They denounce
all those who disagree by labeling
them “communists”—and then pro-
ceed to use communist methods to
eliminate them.

Another indication is found
throughout the state press. Dr. Sil-
ver’s address to the Southern Histor-
ical Association Convention in Ashe-
ville, North Carolina in 1963 was
given a whole page in the New York
Times, but the Jackson Clarion-
Ledger simply reported under a
headline of DR SILVER SPEAKS
AGAIN, that “he absued the state of
Mississippi, its people, officials and
newspapers in the same fashion he

has in previous speeches in Atlanta,
Memphis and other points.” The re-
porting elsewhere in the state was
no better. When the “free press” be-
comes voluntarily subservient to the
government, the whole principle is
made tawdry and unworkable.

The “closed society” simply means
that the freedoms of speech and the
press, the academic freedoms of dis-
cussion and difference of opinion,
and the much mentioned “rights of
association” are all geared to one
narrow viewpoint. They have been
sidetracked for the sole use of the
White Citizens Council and the state
government .In Mississippi and much
of the South it is not truth that
counts—it is dogma; it is not the
diversity of life that counts—its is
“the system.”

It touches the lives of many—the
professor whose academic tenure
was violated on order of the Citi--
zens Council (they knew nothing
and cared less about the repercus-
sions on the University accredita-
tion); the failure of the state’s news-
papers to print the truth about the
riots at Ole Miss; the failure of a
Mississippi jury to convict a “profes-
sional agitator” who was handing
out high-powered rifles to rioting
students and pouring gasoline over
barricades and overturned vehicles;
the professor who had to keep a
borrowed shotgun in his front closet
for fear of retribution (Dr. Silver
himself!); the scores of forward-
looking businessmen and leading
citizens who bow to the “system”
rather than speak out against it
because they are afraid of the con-
sequences; and the deliberate lies
of the state government to its citi-
zens.

I am a Southerner and I have
been part of the “closed society.”
I have at least reached the point of
recognizing that such a society, de-
void of so much of the traditional
freedoms and values of American
life, must be changed or it will drag
the South into its own complete
stagnation. Every Southerner should
read this book! It shows the “closed
society” for what it is—not actually

a part of the traditional Southern)

way of life at all, but a perversion

a helping hand from Jack Kelley,

a bomb when Kelly lowered the

his tall end Bill Follweiler who
loped to the W&L 4. From there
Funk once again hit Follweiler for
the score and once again VanDean
converted to end the afternoon’s
scoring.

The Baby Generals’ only threat
came in the closing minutes of the
half as Tom Pittman hit Jack An-
thony and Crosland with sharp
passs and carried once himself as
W&L moved to the 18. With first
down there the Brigadier line
broke down and the half ended with
a desperation pass on fourth and 36
to go.

In the scoreless second half the
highlight was the splendid defen-
sive work of the Baby Generals as
the cadets were once stopped on
the W&L 15, and were most of the
time throttled by the outstanding
work of Buddy Atkins Strait Fairey,
F. L. Wilson, and Rawleigh Taylor.

Chase Adds Final
The last touchdown came after an
Eagle fumble with Skip Chase
over from the one. The conversion

attempt was unsuccessful.
Bridgewater added six points near
the end of the game, as freshman
quarterback Jim Tilgnor turned a
busted play into a 14-yard touch-
down scamper. The run for the extra
points was stopped short of the goal.
Next Saturday the Generals are
hosts to the Purple Tigers of Se-
wanee, the pre-season favorites in
the CAC. Sewanee will probably be
looking ahead to the Washington
game, while the Generals would like
to make it a successful homecoming.

 

Briggs Review of H®rlow
(Continued from page 2)

I have only seen one of her movies,
“Hell’s Angels,’ made for Howard
Hughes in 1930, but the effectwas
ineradicable. There are some women
whose faces, by some strange combi-
nation of shape and lustre do not
affect you at the moment your first
shiver with recognition, but rather
afterwards in an additory flash when
the face is absent and only the
necromantie anguish returns. What-
ever look she had, it revealed her
quitessence. Her head was like a
candle’s flame over a most un-stick-
like body. The hair cured around
the radiant forehead, the bright red
lips and full-blown animated, All-
American, not particularly well-car-
ed-for beauty. Yet the other movie-
goers snickered at her cheap look-
ing gowns, chuckled at her shaved
eyebrows, and laughed at her corny
lines. She was a wayward waif, an
all-American inamorata, and a
vagrant valentine. It all goes to
show that if you want to know what
God thinks of beauty, look at the

people he gave it to.

Attention Turns To Tigers Tomorrow

 

Trustees Meet
To Consider
Alumni House

The Washington and Lee Alumni
Association Board of Trustees will
meet today to review a _ proposal
for the renovation of the home of the
late Dr. Fitzgerald Flournoy into an
alumni house. At the time the board
will inspect detailed plans which
have been submitted by a prominent
Lynchburg architectural firm. In the
event that these plans are approved,
the next step would be for the
Alumni Board to receive bids from
interested construction firms.

In en interview, however, Mr. W.
C. Ashburn, Executive Secretary of
the Alumni Association, stated thai

 

nothing definite could be announced
concerning the future prospects o/
an alumni house until the Board
has reached a decision. He further
stated that it is entirely possible that
the proposed alterations will be con-
sidered impractical and that the
erection of an entirely new structure
might prove more feasible.

Mr. Washburn was emphatic in
stressing the need for an alumni
house, for at present, the University
does not have facilities for accom-
modating its alumni during such
events as class reunions and home-
comings. Currently the Commons
must accommodate the social func-
tions accompanying these events—
an arrangment with obvious dis-
advantages. In addition to fulfilling
alumni needs ,the proposed house
would also be used for faculty social
functions.

Executive Committee Acts On Student Petition:
Assimilation Committee Referendum To Be Held

Last Wednesday night, the Execu-
tive Committee set in motion a pro-
cess to bring the existence and
powers of the Assimilation Commit-
tee before a student referendum.
The Executive Committe’s action fol-
lowed the receipt of a student pe-
tition requesting such a referendum.

These students believe that un-
enforced conventional dress could
exist at W&L in light of similar
conditions at University of Virginia.

The text of the petition, delivered
to the EC. earlier this week is
as follows:

“We the undersigned do hereby
petition and request the Execu-
tive Committee of the Student
Body of Washington and Lee to
eonduct before Christmas Vacation
a referendum on whether or not
the student government will con-
tinue to enforce conventional dress.
The referendum must further pro-
vide a mechanism to determine
what items of clothing will be
embraced by the term “conven-
tional dress.” should enforced con-

Specifically, this mechanism must
determine whether wheat jeans,
trousers with patch pockets, trous-
ers not cut in an ivy league style,
madras and patterned shirts, and
the disuse of socks will be con-

“The undersigned do not neces-
sarily wish to abolish the Assim-
ilation Committee, but they do
wish to he sure that enforced
conventional dress is a tradition

Washington and Lee students.”

The petition was signed by fifty
students.

the student body in the near future.
The referendum will go before the
Executive Committee for final ap-

A spokesman for the petitioning
group told the Ring-tum Phi, “We
would like to emphasize that our
petition is not designed against the
tradition of conventional dress. It
is simply a request for a definite
decision. Many of us hope to
strengthen the tradition by giving
the Assimilation Committee definite

hope to see an end to a codification
of conventional dress. All of us are

Activities Begin Tonight
In Red Square at 7 p.m.

By MIKE DUNN
A parade and pep rally combine with a football contest
with unbeaten Sewanee to head the list of this weekend’s ac-
tivities as W&L alumni return to Lexington for the annual

Homecoming Weekend.

Starting from Red Square at 7 o'clock tonight, a student

parade will follow a fire engine

ington Street to Doremus Gymna-*——

sium for the pep rally. This tradition,
of the Pajama Parade will be re-'
stored as freshmen parade through
the town.

M.C. Randy Jones and Sem cheer-
leaders will conduct the rally fol-
lowed by the presentation of the
fraternity Homecoming representa-
tives. The Minx Jazz quartet will
provide the music.

Varsity Club president Butch West
has announced that the club ic offer-
ing a prize of $10 to the best sign
in the parade or at the rally.

From 3 to 7 o'clock this afternoon
a committee of from eight to ten
faculty members, alumni, and resi-
dents of Lexington judged the
Homecomings displays built by the
fraternities during the past week.

 

and fourth place trophies on the
basis of originality, thought, effort,
and appropriateness of the theme.

Visiting alumni will register to-
morrow from 9 to 12 a.m. in Wash-
ington Hall. Tours of the campus will
also run during these hours.

From 10 to 12 am. alumni and.
their guests may attend a coffee and
open house at the home of Presi-
dent Cole, followed by a luncheon
at Evans Dining Hall. Interested
alumni are also invited to fraternity
open houses from 8 until 12 p.m.

The highlight of the weekend,
however, is tomorrow's game at 2
p.m. when the Generals meet the
Sewanee Purple Tigers in what
should be a fast-moving, hard-
fought game. Sewanee’s 6-0 record
has given it the top spot in the
College Athletic Conference. Half-
time ceremonies will include a pres-
entation of the Homecoming repre-
sentative and the selection of the
Queen.

 

Nineteen candidates, one repre-

up Jefferson Street and Wash-
resenting each fraternity and the
Independent Union, will vie for the
honor of being Washington and Lee’s
Homecoming Queen for 1964.

Larry Meeks, SPE, coordinator of
the event, announced that the can-
didates will be presented this eve-
ning at the pep rally in Doremus
Gymnasium.

The judging committee, led by Dr.
James K. Shillington, will select a
Queen this evening but will keep
their decision secret until the formal
coronation tomorrow. Dr. Shilling-
ton will personally crown the win-
ner.

In a major change from previous
policy, a first and a second runner-
up will be selected and crowned
during the half along with the
Queen. Meeks expressed optmism
about the selection of the runners-
up and added, “we hope to revive
some of the spirit that was missing
from last year’s festivities.

Queen candidates will be present-
ed immediately after the 7:15 pm.
pep rally in the Gym. They will
then be escorted to the Student
Union where Dr. Shillington’s com-
mittee will select a Queen and the
two runners-up. All candidates will
be presented at the football game,
and during the half, the Queen and
runners-up will be formally crown-
ed..

Shortened Classes

In response to student body
president Jim Kulp’s petition, the
faculty has agreed to shorten to-
morrow's class schedule so that
“S° hour will end at 12:10 rather
than at 1:00. The faculiy stressed
that this was being done so that
all students would be able to get
into the stadium before the kick-
off and avoid late arrivals,

An Opportunity for Education

Washington and Lee has entered the
twentieth century.

Narrow-minded,  segregationalist views
which persisted in the 1870’s have been dis-
carded to make way for the inevitable realities
of the 1960’s which should have been the
realities of the 1890's, if indeed they should
have been maintained that long. The clarifica-
tion on admissions recently released by the
Board of Trustees (for it is a clarification of
statement and not a radical departure from
previous policy) frees W&L from the attribu-
tion of prejudice at a time when the rest of
the South and the nation as a whole are be-
coming cognizant of the fact that Negroes
are human beings, and are realizing that their
racial policies have been bigoted and unreal-
istic. The lowering of racial barriers at prac-
tically every superior educational institution in
the South as well as elsewhere, including
neighboring girls’ schools, is just another in a
long line of witnesses to this fact.

There is no reason for W&L to maintain
its traditional status quo which has recently
placed the school merely on the brink of great-
ness. A university’s success or failure depends
in large part upon the extent to which it allows
the student to meet new and challenging
ideas, even if they may seem to be impala-
table at first glance.

Perhaps it is because many of us have not
had the opportunity of genuine association
with Negroes of a superior calibre in the past
that we condemn the whole of the race as un-
able to contribute to the broadening of our
horizons. There is a need for association with
Negroes at this school in the same way that
students need to be confronted with untried
ideas in order that they may test the validity of
the opinions which they hold. The success of
a student’s own education depends on the
extent to which he is willing to take up the
challenge of examining both sides of a ques-
tion and to expose himself to “the other side.”

If there is no exposure to the other
side, there can be no opportunity for growth
in the minds of the students and active
inquiry succumbs to the sterile stability.
We cannot ignore the problem of integra-
tion; it will not go away; we can only enter
the twentieth century and accept the realis-
tic attitude of confronting it. No concept
can be tested without examination; we now

 

A One-Party § ystem?

The voters in the election of 1964 have
given a decisive answer to the crucial question
of the campaign. To the question, “Should
the federal government continue to play a
large part in questions concerning industry,
labor, economics, and private living benefits,
in preference to a restroation of individual
freedoms and liberties?, the American elect-
orate has answered, “Yes!", in an overwhelm.
ing majority,

It is our fear that Lyndon Johnson will
consider this overwhelming evidence of the
voters’ confidence in him as a mandate to in-
crease the role of federal intervention to a
staggering domination, and hence a decrease
in individual rights and liberties. It is our fear
that the ill effects of this socialistic advance
(or classify it as you will) will accompany
the good, and perhaps even outweigh the
good, effects.

We are glad that Johnson won. We will
be sad to see our fears become actualities, if
the President infers that the American public
desires that no restraint be put on the fed.
eral government. We are sorry to see Mr.
Johnson sweep the election by an unprece-
dented majority; we fear that he will infer
too much from this, It is our hope that the
President will see his victory not as a mandate
tor increasing sO ialistic programs but as a
mandate for strong leadership.

We are, on the other hand, not sorry that
a conservative, as strong a conservative as Bar-
ry Goldwater, ran against President Johnson.
The effect of Mr. Goldwater's candidacy has
been to moderate the views of President John.

have the opportunity to test our concepts.

Validity is an impossibility if we are pre-

sented with only one choice to consider.

Can we say our education is complete

if we are not courageous enough to submit
our beliefs to an open-minded examination?
Do we have the courage to submit our beliefs
to scrutiny? Are any beliefs which do not stand
up in an investigation worth holding? Or, are
we afraid that we shall find these comfortable
and traditional beliefs and attitudes out-moded
and the remnants of a past era?

We now have the opportunity to ex-
amine our attitudes. We can now gain a full
modern education at Washington and Lee.
The world outside of the Shenandoah val-
valley is coming to the realization that its
population is made not only of whites, but
also of Negroes, of Chinese, and of other
peoples of various races and creeds. Wash-
ington and Lee has fled its provincialism;
it is willing to enter the outside world. But,
are we, the students, willing to grow with
it? Are we willing to enter the twentieth
century?

The policies of the Admissions Commit-
tee will apply equally to members of all races;
no Negro is going to be granted admission
simply because he is a Negro. He must meet
the high standards that have been met by all
of us who are now students of this University.
No one will be forced to accept an inferior
student, simply because he is a Nego, as a
fellow member of the W&L student body.
Futhermore, there will be no effort on the
part of the Admissions Staff to search out a
qualified Negro to apply for, or accept, ad-
mitance into the Washington and Lee stu-|
dent body.

Although Washington and Lee is a private
institution, we have no right to force students
to conform with accepted and untried tradi-

tions. We now have the opportunity to test|/

our traditions and our attitudes. In a way, we
are a test case. Are we willing to linger on the
brink of greatness through the maintenance of
antiquated attitudes? Or, are we willing to
pioneer the way in twentieth century edu-

cation?

son in a way that was vitally needed. The fact
that a conservative led the Republican Party
certainly reveals that the nation as a whole

is not ready to submit to a Washington-con-
trolled United States.

We are sorry that Goldwater was beaten
by such a sizeable majority, because of the
unbalance this has created in the two-party
system. The apathy created among some Re-
publicans by the fact of Goldwater's candidacy
caused them to stay away from the polls, It
contributed to such men as Keating, Percy,
and Taft's losing their respective campaigns.
That these fine leaders would have stood a
better chance of election if they had run un-
der the leadership of a stronger candidate
goes without saying. That they were not elect.
ed is a crime, a crime committed not only
against them, but also against the American

public.

The equilibrium which a two-party sys-
tem has given the United States has certainly
contributed to the effective government which
this country has had in the past. With the
waning GOP, this balance has been disrupted
and the country has now become a one-party
country in a way that has seldom occurred in
the past.

President Johnson has been issued an au
thority and given a mandate that is clear and
unmistakable, It will be considered, hopefully,
a mandate to follow a national consensus in
domestic and foreign policy. It will, hopefully,
continue to be used with the same restraint
and common sense that Lyndon Baines John

tarily supported by a society. Brooks
Brown’s admission about who does
the assimilating at W&L is striking
because it indicates that the very
people who should be supporting
this “tradition” (i.e, the ordinary
students) are extremely apathetic
about it.

But so much for statistics. Actual
experience and observation indicate
that the average W&L student will
assimilate someone for only two
reasons—as a joke or as a means of
carrying on a petty vendetta with
another student. In fact, I would
go so far as to say that almost
no one ever assimilates another stu-
dent because he feels it his duty or
because he believes in conventional
dress as defined by the Assimilation
Committee. The exception to this
rule are the members of the Assim-
ilation Committee themselves, who
need assimilations to give some val-
ue to their jobs and who do usually
feel duty-bound to support their
concept of conventional dress. Hence,
2 per cent of the student body makes
50 per cent of the assimilations.

As a matter of fact, the Assimila-
tion Committee is actually held in
contempt by a significant proportion
of the W&L student body. In the
words of a letter recently received
by the Ring-tum Phi the Assimila-
tion Committee has come to repre-
sent legal buffoonery and petty try-
anny to a great many students.

Reasons for Decline

Why, one might wonder, has a
supposedly student-created institu-
tion like the Assimilation Com-
mittee reached such a low degree
of reputation and respect? The an-
swer is obvious—most students are
not sure that the Assimilation Com-
mittee and its notions of what makes
“conventional dress” are sanctioned
by the general will of the students.
No one at W&L can say authori-
tatively that the Assimilation Com-
mittee does not represent a sup-
pression of the majority’s wishes by
a very small minority. The Assimi-
lation Committee has ceased to be
a student-supported tradition and
has gradually assumed the posture
of dictatorial little cabal invested
with the power of financial punish-
ment,

mittee be saved from this dilemma of

W &L, Sewanee Clash
In Homecoming Tilt

By JOHNNY GRAHAM

The single wing has disappeared from college football—

almost.

The Tigers of the University of the South are one of the

few teams in the country still

using this powerful offense,

and it will present a definite problem for Washington and Lee’s
Generals as the two teams meet tomorrow at 2 p.m. on Wil-

son Field.

Sewanee carries a 14-game win
streak into the contest. The Tigers
haven’t lost since dropping their

final game of the 1962 season. Last
year’s record of 8-0-0, including a
35-6 humbling of the Generals, was
good enough to bring them the
College Athletic Conference foot-
ball championship.

The single wing offense will put
tremendous pressure on the General
defensive forward wall. Middle
guard Charlie Myers, tackle Starke
Sydnor and Jack Kelley and ends
Tersh Baker and Bob Reading will
have their hands full trying to
handle the power packed offense.
Several changes in alignments have
been made to check the formation.

General coach Lee McLaughlin in-
dicated pleasure at the way his
charges moved the football in Satur-
urday’s 20-16 win over Bridge-
water.

“For the last two weeks we have
moved the ball well on the ground,”
he stated. “Last week we got out-
side for some long gains.”

Sewanee, however, has two good
defensive ends, and the best chance
for long gains seems to be knocking
the end out and cutting inside and
then to the sidelines.

General manpower will be great-
er than it has been in recent weeks.
Fullback John Anthony is the only
starter definitely out. He reinjured
his ankle the only time he carried
the ball on Saturday.

McLaughlin had praise for sev-
eral players following Saturday’s
victory. Tackles Starke Sydnor and
Logie Bullitt drew praise for their
defensive play with Sydnor also
lauded for playing “his best offeffn-
sive game.” Fullback Tommy Sparks
played an outstanding game both
on offense and defense and Dan
Manson, also a fullback, was impres-
ive on offense.

Johnson Leads

Tigers’ Attack

M. L. Agnew, the Mr. Everything
of the College Athletic Conference,
has graduated. One would think
things would be looking up. They
aren't.

Agnew played tailback last season
for Sewanee, Washington and Lee’s
homecoming opponent here tomor-
row. He ran for 835 yards, passed
for 507 yards (60.3 per cent com-
plete) and scored ten touchdowns.

Bill Johnson has arrived.

Last season, playing wingback
and tailback in Sewanee’s single
wing offense, Johnson was sort of
a potent non-entity. He carried 10
times for a 16.6 yard average but
didn’t throw any passes. He caught
10-tops on the team—while scoring
five touchdowns.

Now he plays talback and throws
as well as runs. He’s a 6-2, 205-
pound junior English major from
Yorkville, Ill. He runs the 100 in
9.9.

“We've seen movies where tacklers
had good angles on him and he just
simply ran off and left them. He’s
not the triple threat that Agnew
was, but he is every bit as good
a runner,” W&L coach Lee Mec-
Laughlin says.

Johnson is averaging something
over seven yards a carry. He’s gained
500 yards in Sewanee’s first six
games which, incidentally, were all
easy wins.

Sewanee defeated Randolph-Ma-
con, 34-13, Centre, 34-0, and Hamp-
den-Sydney, 28-7. W&lL lost to all
three, 8-0, 8-0, and 21-0.

Sewanee was undefeated in eight
games last year and so will be look-
ing for its 15th straight win.

pull out a victory by three points.

SAE was led by Kester

the medley relay, the breaststroke
and the individual medley.

events.

Aside from Denman, Clinard of
Beta was the only to get two firsts
as he ran away with

Executive Committee plans to con-
duct an official referendum on the

E.C. Considers Proposal

To Set Mock

By MIKE HASH
Assistant Editor

Last night the Executive Commit-
tee held its regular weekly meeting
in order to consider several perti-
nent proposals concerning the pos-
sibility of a mock honor trial, the
selection of an interim coordinator
of the Mock Convention and the ref-
erendum dealing with the Assimila-
tion Committee.

Changing its weekly meeting to
Monday night, the Executive Com-
mittee plans to continue its policy
of open meetings with the necessary
prerogative of executive session in
confidential matters. In addition
members of the student body are free
to express their opinions on issues
under consideration by the EC either
in writing or in person.

Mock Honor Trial

A sub-committee of the EC sub-
mitted a proposal to serve as a basis
for a possible mock honor trial. The
recommendation in par suggested
that a tape of an honor trial some
8 to 10 years ago be transcribed
omitting the names of those involv-
ed and given to certain members of
the Law School faculty so that
the transcription might be edited
to include dramatic effect.

The mock trial if held would per-
haps be a mandatory assembly for
freshmen and first year law stu-
dents. The most appropriate setting

 

for the trial which would be pro-

Honor Trial

duced by members of the EC is Lee
Chapel.

Convention Interim
Final selections of a Mock Con-
vention Interim Coordinator was de-
layed pending interviews of seven
prospective applicants. The EC did
decide to select one sophomore and
one freshman to serve as dual co-
ordinators of the 1968 Mock Con-
vention. The seven applicants are;
sophomores Dave Mayfield, Frank
Fairchild, Howard Epstein; fresh-
men, Rod Boren, Steve Saunders,

Bill Stone and Webb DeHoff.

The petition for a referendum on
the question of conventional dress
and on the existence of the Assimila-
tion Committee was passed on to
Brooks Brown, chairman of the com-

mittee, so that a suitable draft of|

the referendum might be presented
to the student body as soon as pos-
sible.

Dress Clarification

In essence the bill will request a
clarification of what is considered
conventional dress and a vote of
confidence for the continuation of
the Assimilation Committee. The
referendum will not have the force
of a constitutional amendment which
requires a two-thirds majority of
the student body. Its primary pur-

pose is to reflect the present con-|

sensus of the students in order to
serve as a basis for maintaining the
tradition of conventional dress.

Author Praises Presentation

 

 

|
The concluding part of this year’s
Glasgow Endowment Series was pre- |
sented Friday evening, Nov. 6, in du-
| Pont Auditorium. The program in-|
| cluded a reading of portions from
| the poem “Brother To Dragons: A
Tale in Verse and Voices” by Pulit-
zer Prize Winner Robert Penn War-
ren, and a subsequent discussion of
the poem led by the author.
The reading and discussion cli-
| maxed a series of lectures presented
| by Mr. Warren under the sponsor-
| ship of the Glasgow Committee last |
| week. Earlier the multi-talented
| writer had delivered a reading from

IFC Discusses —
VMI Censorship

By DAVE MARCHESE

Last night, the IFC met in the Stu-
dent Union. After the roll call and the
reading of last week's minutes reports
were made by the various standing
committees. Foreign student chairman
| Harry Dennery and Contact Chair-
|man Blaine Brownell reported that
their committees were progressing to
the satisfaction of all.

Further progress has been made in
} an attempt to straighten out the prev-
iously confusing bus transportation

 

fin, assigned to the task, reported that
| Pete’s Taxi and Bus Co., was planning
to take over the franchise. The stu-
dents aare reminded that unless
enough of them purchase their date’s
bus ticket at the Co-op before Fri-
day, the buses would not be able to
run. And if they don’t run the tickets
will be refunded. The LF.C. strongly
recommends this useful service. They
have worked hard to establish it and
feel that everyone concernd will bene-
fit.

Under new business, the Rat Pack
will be back on campus, on an invi-
tation basis only. This refers to the
returned presence of VMI Cadets at
W&L social functions. Again, on an
invitation basis only

A startling situation was brought to

light at last night's meeting. Dean At-
wood announced that twelve of our
eighteen fraternities have failed to

wesent financial reports dating as far
back as January, 1964, despite contin-
ual promises to do so. He informed the
representatives that those fraternitie
| which had not made good these over-
| due statements by December first, 1964

representative selections of his poet-
ry and had discussed the origin and
metamorphosis of his novel, All the
King’s Men.

Friday night’s program began
with a reading of the poem
“Brother to Dragons.” Although
the work is of book-length, War-
ren emphasized that the poem is
a dialogue and not a play. Out of
necessity, the reading of the poem
was abridged into three chrono-
logical sections respectively titled:
“Texture,” “Incident,” and “The-
sis”

The background information for| discuss is in my view at least a hu-|

the poem, which is based on a series
| of factual occurrences, was related
by Dr. Severn Duvall who provided

the narration. He explained that the|

poem dealt with the migration of

the early 1800's. Taking with him his |

Four In Reading of Warren Play

their dead mother. The verse plot
deals with the fate of the two
brothers, as discussed by them af-
ter their death.

Reviewing the actual plot of the
poem, Mr. Warren stated: “The main
body of the action is in the remote
past—in the earthly past of the
characters long dead—and now they
meet at an unspecified place and at
an unspecified time to try to make
sense of that action. We may take
them to appear, and disappear, as
their inner urgencies, and the ur-
| gencies of argument, swell and sub-
| side. The issue that the characters

 

man constant.”
| Mrs, G. W. Ray, compassionately
| interpreted the part of Lucy Lewis,

the sister of Thomas Jefferson.
The role of Thomas Jefferson was
portrayed by Mr. John Evans, a
new member of the W&L English
Department. In a very finished
reading Mr. James Boatwright as-
sumed the contrasting roles of the
two sons, Isham and Lilburn, and
Meriwether Lewis, a cousin of Jef-
ferson. Finally Dr. Cecil Jones
rendered the part of RPW, a fic-
tional representation of the author.

In the discussion which followed
the reading, Mr. Warren compli-
menting the editing of the poem,
initially stated: “I was struck by
the critical astuteness with which
| the abridging was done, by the elo-
quence of the presentation, and by
the great sympathetic attempt to
bring to life some of my limping
lines.” Responding to a question
posed by President Fred Cole, Mr.
Warren commented on the back-
ground of the poem

Phi Kap Entry

Isabel Loperena

Crowned Queen
By KIP ARMSTRONG

Homecoming last weekend
was highlighted by the greatest
outburst of spirit at Washing-
ton and Lee in recent years,
and the largest crowd of the

season saw the Generals re-
spond with a complete upset vic-
tory over previously unbeaten Se-
wanee.

Miss Maria Isabel Loperena, rep-
resenting Phi Kap, was crowned
Homecoming Queen at halftime of
the game, and it was announced
that Sigma Phi Epsilon’s “Roll the
Tigers” theme had won the fraterni-
ty display contest.

Torchlight Parade
The activities began with a torch-
light parade on Friday night. The
turn-out for this event, a restora-
tion of the freshman pajama parade,
was the first real display of spirit

*shown by the student body this

year. The parade was followed by a
Pep Rally in the gym conducted
by M.C. Randy Jones and loyal Sem
cheerleaders. It was evident at the
rally that this could be no ordinary
weekend.

The Homecoming representatives
were introduced and received a great
reception, especially the last five
lovelies, representing such renown-
ed female institutions as Briarcliff,
Pine Manor, Limestone, and our own
Southern Seminary. Cheers for the
team followed, and the crowd’s re-
sponse to Co-captains Crenshaw’s
speech indicated the hopes of all for
victory. The rally ended as a horde
of screaming freshmen raced off into
the night, an indication that W&L’s
former spirit had returned.

SPE Wins Display

All eighteen fraternities partici-
pated in the successful Homecom-
ing display competition, which added
|much to the wekend. A committee
|of ten, representing the faculty,
| alumni, and local residents, judged
the various displays on Friday af-
ternoon. Prizes were awarded at
the football game for originality,
thought, effort, and appropriateness
of the theme. SPE captured first
prize, with a well-executed “Roll
the Tigers” complete with song.
Lamda Chi took second, followed by
Sigma Nu and Pi Phi.

Classes were shortened Saturday
to give students time to get seats be-
fore the opening kickoff. When the
| Generals took the field at 1:45 p.m.,
| the crowd rose to its feet and cheer-
ed. The ensuing struggle between
the Generals and the poyerful pur-
ple Tigers of Sewanee was one of
the greatest in Washington and Lee
annals. The Generals dominated the
play from the opening kick-off to
the final gun. As 4,000 students,
dates, faculty, and alumni cheered
louder than any crowd in recent
years, every General on the field

 

played his heart out.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Assimilation Referendum

The Tuesday Edition welcomes the an-
nouncement in last Friday’s Ring-tum Phi that
there will be a referendum held concerning
student body opinion on the Assimilation
Committee. We welcome this referendum, not
because we see the end of the Assimilation
Committee, but rather because we foresee an
endorsement of this committee by the student
body. This endorsement plus exact student
opinion on clothing standards has long been
needed by the committee.

It was sad after reading this announce-
ment on page one of Friday’s paper to turn
then to the second page and read a regrettable
column on the same matter. This column, en-
titled “A Fast Declining Institution,” was both
presumptuous and misrepresentative concern-
ing the Assimilation Committee. There is al-
ready too much misunderstanding about the
Assimilation Committee on campus, and this
column certainly did not help clear up any of
this. For the freshmen, for those who do not
know there is another side to this story.

The presumptions to be found in the
column last week are astounding. The column-
ist somehow feels himself competent to label
the Assimilation Committee a “‘dictorial little
cabel invested with the power of financial
punishment.” He assumes (presumably on the
basis of fifty students that signed the peti-
tion—many of whom wanted an endorsement
of the committee) that the Assimilation Com-
mittee has reached a “low degree of reputa-
tion and respect.”

It may indeed be true that the column-
ist’s personal opinion is such, but the opin-
ion certainly does not seem true for the ma-
jor portion of the student body. More im-
portant, the lack of understanding which is
shown by calling the committee cute little
names and implying that it enjoys extract-
ing one dollar fines from students is exactly
what the Assimilation Committee has had to
fight all along. An assimilation fine is only
given grudgingly, and then only to perpet-
ual offenders or students who show lack of
respect for conventional dress. No one on
the committee enjoys fining another stu-
dent, despite what uninformed students may
think.

The columnist goes on to tell us that “ex-
perience and observation” will show that the
“average W&L student” will assimilate some-
one “for only two reasons—as a joke or...
a petty vendetta.” Why not go to someone
who really has experience and observation, a
member—past or present—of the Assimila-
tion Committee. He will admit that instances
of this type do happen, but he will also tell
you that the two above reasons are not the only
reasons, and hardly the major reasons for
assimilations.

But so much for muddy water already over
the dam. Let us view the Assimilation Com-
mittee in more positive terms. What has the
Committee done thus far this year? What
about the “tradition” of conventional dress?
Is the Assimilation Committee really needed?
Finally, what about the standards of dress
here?

Brooks Brown, Chairman of the Assimila-
tion Committee, has been working all fall to
engender in the students a respect and under-
standing for the committee. There has been
an effort to stress the causes for rules and the
necessity for cooperation among students.
Every case brought before the committee is
dealt with in a personal manner, with due con-
sideration for genuine mistakes and unavoid-
able instances. Beanies were dropped for the
more “respectable” and easier to keep name
tags. Standards of conventional dress were
made clear to all students in a pre-school let-
ter, and stressed to freshmen at camp. With
an increased understanding of why and how
the Assimilation Committee works, there has
been an increased respect for the group by
the student body.

 

At the crux of the matter, however, is
the age old question: “Do we really need an
Assimilation Committee?” Attacks on the
Assimilation Committee usually take this
form: “Well, conventional dress is supposed
to be a tradition here, and traditions are not
supposed to be enforced (i.e., everyone
follows traditions willingly). So why have
an Assimilation Committee? Student opin-
ion will keep dress standards high on this
campus.” Admitting that the whole idea of

“tradition” is a tricky business, let us look
to our really time honored tradition . . . the
Honor System. Here we also have a tradi-
tion that most of us deem to be worthwhile,
a tradition that we look to the student body
to uphold, and at the same time we have
the Executive Committee to handle the ac-
tual cases. The Assimilation Committee pro-
vides the same type function for the tradi-
tion of conventional dress.

The only real bone that some members of
the student body have to pick with the As-
similation Committee is that of the actual
standards that are to be considered “‘conven-
tional dress.” Tastes differ, but the basic ap-
parel that marks a gentleman does not. For
this reason the Assimilation Committee has
tried to work within the “spirit of convention-
al dress,” rather than the letter of the law.

The basis rudiments of a coat, tie, slacks,
and socks have always been recognized both
by the committee and the student body.

It is now the hope of the Assimilation
Committee, as voiced by Chairman Brown,
that the students will make its views on the
particulars of conventional dress plain in the
referendum. The committee will draw up the
referendum in such a way as to give the stu-
dents a full choice on all the current issues
concerning what is to be the standard of
gentlemanly dress here.

While it must be remembered that the
forthcoming referendum is not a constitu-
tional referendum, it could pave the way for
major changes in the idea of conventional
dress as applied to the campus. This places
a great responsibility on the students—and
indeed this is where the responsibility should
lie. Each student must think about exactly
what he wants his campus to look like. It
is the hope of the Tuesday Edition that an
endorsement of the Assimilation Committee
as well as a vote for high standards of dress
will be forthcoming in the referendum.

Law School Ties

Last week the law school sent 21 men to
have their pictures taken for the law section
of the yearbook. This fraction of about one-
eighth of the law students is unrepresentative
of the law school and will appear so in the
Calyx, which this year, as every year recently,
must solve the problem of how to feature such
a small number as being the W&L law school
student body. We hope that, rather than
printing the pictures of this fraction of law
students, the Calyx will leave the law pictures
out entirely this year and merely list the names
of the law student body.

 

If the law school expects to be pictured
in the yearbook it should be able to round up
at least a majority of students willing to have
their pictures taken. The trouble is that the
law school does not want to be in the Calyx,
nor does it have much of a desire for any con-
nection at all with the undergraduate student
body. Law students are not generally interested
in the Ring-tum Phi, nor the Southern Col-
legian, nor the Calyx and understandably;
since there is only a small amount of space
devoted to the law school by these publica-
tions. Underlying this is a dissocation of Tuck-
er Hall from the rest of the campus which has
become more and more obvious lately.

The situation has worsened in the last few
years as the law school has received more and
more graduates of other colleges. The new
law school student body has fewer interests
in common with the college. Few law students
attend undergraduate activities; almost none
concern themselves with undergraduate prob-
lems. Law students are virtually never assimi-
lated perhaps because they are not taken for
members of the student body—and honor
system cases from the law school are unheard
of. Although law students compose one-third
of the Executive Committee, probably the
great majority of law students want nothing
to do with campus politics.

There are occasions, such as the Mock
Conventions, when cooperation between the
law school and the college is beneficial. And
the law students on the EC must be valuable
members in honor system trials because of
their familiarity with legal procedure. But
some mandatory ties between the two schools,
as in the case of the Calyx, may have become
unreasonable. This is a problem which de
serves study and perhaps action by the Execu-
tive Committee,

 

 

Percy Republican of the Future,
Despite Goldwater - Linked Loss

By JIM De YOUNG

(Editor’s Note: Jim De Young is
a friend of the Percy family. He was
associated with Percy’s campaign the
last two summers, and he was work-
ing in Percy’s headquarters in Chi-
cago the night of the election.
De Young has also found that
Percy’s grandfather taught at W&L
Charles B. Percy, B.S., C.E., Assist-
ant Professor of Applied Mathemat-
ics and Chemistry, 1870.

As he went down to stunning de-
feat last Tuesday, Barry Goldwater
carried many outstanding men with
him, among them Charles H. Per-

 

Charles

cy, Republican gubernatorial can-|
didate in the state of Illinois. Rich-|
ard Nixon had singled out Percy’s|
race for the governorship as the most
important single race in the nation
aside from the Presidency itself.
Percy had been labeled the dy-
namic Republican in this campaign,
the man of the future for the Re-
publicans. He had been elected Pres-|

 

Progress. He had also been appoint,
ed Chairman of the Republican
Party’s 1960 Platform Committee. He
had become President of Bell and
Howell Company at 29 and had
been elected Chairman of the Board
in 1961, a position he still holds.
The Chicago Daily News had
remarked of Percy’s candidacy.
“Good men seldom go into poli-
tics, and that’s one big reason gov-
ernment serves the people as in-
differently as it does. Charles H.
Percy is the ablest man to enter
the political scene for many years.
He is the man who can wrest this

Percy

state from the machine politicians,
the hoodlums, the incompetents
and put it on the high road of ef-
ficiency and _ progress... Illinois
stands on the threshold of great-
ness and Charles Percy can open
the door.”

Yet Chuck Perey went down in
defeat at the hands of incumbent
governor Otto Kerner by a margin

ident of the United States Republi-| of some 160,000 votes. (Kerner 218,000

can Fund in 1955, and he had been |
selected by President Eisenhower in|
1959 to be chairman of the Repub-|
lican Committee on Program and!

plurality in Chicago, Percy 60,000
down state.) Perey had traveled
250,000 miles in the campaign and
shook some 750,000 hands. He had

 

fought a tireless campaign against
what proved to be overwhelming
odds. His wife, Lorraine, his twin
19-year-old daughters, Valerie and
Sharon, and his 17-year-old son,
Roger, had been outstanding in their
endeavors.

Why then the defeat? The inner
circle of his brain trust and the can-
didate himself concluded that there
were no serious errors in the cam-
paign. A few problems could have
been handled differently, but the
Percy camp felt that the election
outcome would not have really been
effected.

As for the Goldwater issue, the
Percy organization believed that
renouncing Goldwater or going all
out for him would have resulted
in disaster. The Percy headquarters
had received as early as August a
poll report that Goldwater would
lose by 800,000 votes and that
Percy would lead Goldwater by
600,000 votes. As it turned out
Goldwater lost by 900,000 votes
and Perey led Goldwater by ap-
proximately 700,000 votes. In short
then, Percy was aware in August
that he could lose by some 200,000
votes,

Could Percy then have run a Rom-
ney campaign in Illinois? The answer
is no for several reasons. Romney
was an incumbent and he had buil
a large and strong following and
had an_ outstanding record of
achievement. Goldwater was also
much less popular in Michigan than
he was in Illinois.

Percy's Goldwater strategy was
also built through a series of steps,
each being taken as the result of
an immediate pressing problem that
had to be solved on the spot.

Some thought the timing in the
“Goldwater affair” was not appro-
priate. It was felt that if Perey had
waited to announce his vote for
Goldwater at the convention rather
than in June, the result would have
been different.

Percy felt the pressure and puwbli-
city on this question, and he felt he
would have been hurt whenever the
decision had been made. He said that
he wouldn’t have felt comfortable
divorcing himself from the Gold-
water issue. He said he was a party
man and that he couldn’t quit on a
member of the party.

Percy also cited two other ele-
ments that may have taken votes
from him, One was circulation of
a leaflet in Jewish neighborhoods
implying Percy had condoned
anti-Semitic hiring policies at his
Bell and Howell firm. Percy felt
that this pamphlet had disastrous
results at first, But statement by

The Sin They Won't Forgive: Energy

They have failed to see the energy, | manding, that is secure, and that is

enthusiasm, and zest for living in
us that they feel has traditionally
been characteristic of youth.
Some have cried loud and long:
“Where is the pursuit of excellence?”
or “Where is the creative energy
in these people?” The answer they
most often get is a sleepy silence.
But to some extent, we must ask
ourselves hese same questions.
Whether or not we want to listen
to these self-styled reformers, we
must recognize that what they have
seen is a real problem. I think a
quick look around will show us
that most of us are bored, lazy, and
tired. We are in many ways old men.
At Washington and Lee, most of
us were born with exceptional in-
telligence, more adequate means of
survival, and a quite acceptable de,
gree of security. Yet what most of
us want is a life that is not too de-

its center, old friendships dissolved,
ministers ousted from their pulpits,
vicious manifestations of
prejudice, I have developed a hor-
ror in matters where emotions reign
supreme. My personal views on in-
tegration are not important, but Mr
Baur's irrational and pathetic emo-
tionalism is an insidious threat te
any sane Christian society. Mr. Baur
is certainly entitled to his own opin-
ions, but in the interests of the stu-
dent bedy fer which he is so con-
cerned, he should perhaps put a lit-
tle more thoughts into his statements
lest they be taken as the opinion of
even a amall percentage of the Stu-
dent Bedy. The liklihood of this hap-
pening, though, is highly improbable

1 suggest that Mr. Baur sign up
for Sociology 101 (anthropology),
and perhaps Religion 201 (Christian
ethics). Then he would have suffi-

|eclent grounds on which to build an
and |

socially compatible. Few of us are
innovators, few of us creative, few
of us want to develop resources
which we were born to. An occa-
sional spurt of energy is usually
crushed by a pervasive, omnipotent
indolence that characterizes most of
our existence.

There is even considerable evi-
dence that we resent energy and
creativity in those around us. There
is, at Washington and Lee, an al-
most immediate and overwhelming
rejection of someone who is too an-
xious, too eager, too enthusiastic,
or too ambitious. The way to get in-
to the right fraternity is to be cool,
almost indifferent. The one who is
most admired is the one who gets
by with the most (either in aca-
demics, with girls, or in most other

ways) with the least effort. The
cool one is the one who doesn't
try.

Recently a committee formed for
the specific purpose of making mon-
ey for a certain cause rejected an
applicant who had spent a great deal
of time and effort devising and mak-
ing possible a profitable scheme. I
am not certain of the reasons that
committee had, but it seems to me
that at least part of the cause was
that the applicant had been so en-
ergetic, so ambitious, and so eager
that the committee was afraid to
accept him

The causes for his old man men-

Gridders Receive Praise

By TOM CARPENTER
Tuesday Sports Columnist

It seems kind of silly to be writing about the game of this past Saturday
because almost everybody in the student body was in attendance there,
and those that were not probably wish they had been. Speaking of at-
tendance and spirit, 1 might make mention of the fine job by the student
body in getting behind the team and helping them get up for the game.

The pep rally Friday night had a great effect on the team. It showed
them that the students are behind them in full force, a factor in boosting
team morale. The spirit also seemed to be catching in that the attendance
at the game was phenomenal. I believe wholeheartedly that another rally
is in order for the season finale against Washington University,

Everybody Ran Well
There were many individuals who deserve special mention for their
performances, but there were some who really stood out like diamonds.
The running backs, Harry Brookby, Dan Manson, Bill David, Tom Cren-
shaw, Skip Chase,, and, of course, Tom Sparks, were each and every one-
outstanding. Brookby’s hard slicing drives were an inspiration in them-

 

selves. Manson continues his hard running ways while David played a la|
Charlie Taylor with his dancing and twisting runs. Crenshaw ran as if|
there were a pot of gold waiting for him in the end zone, while Chase!
always managed to come up with a few more yards then seemed possible. |
And what could be said about Sparks that is uncomplimentary. He only
gained 145 yards in 20 carries, and he ran over, around or through any-
one that might be in his way. His running style is reminiscent of Jim
Taylor's.

No amount of praise is great enough to equal that which quarterback
Larry Craig deserves, and the same may be said about Craig's replacement
Bryant Kendrick. They called almost faultless games and came up with
the big play habitually. On third down and four or five to go it would be
Craig to David on the break out or hook pattern for the first down or
Sparks or Crenshaw through the line for the necessary yardage.

The blocking was fantastic, but one man stood out above all the others
as I saw it. That was guard Tom Day. Day, with the assistance of Wicky
Stuart and Bill Sledge, was the main reason for the monstrous holes
opened up for Sparks. Day also displayed some of the best running blocks
that I've seen at W&L.

Rugged Defense

 

And then there was the defense. Ends Tersh Baker and Rob Reading
along with linebackers Joe Miller and Jeff Novinger, were the men most
responsible for Bill Johnson's miserable day. Baker and Reading de- |
stroyed blockers time after time, leaving Johnson at the merey of Miller |
and Novinger. Baker also applied a fierce pass rush, hel :

Top—Harry Brookby bolts into the endzone from the one as official gives
word to 4,000 wild General fans. Tigers later match this score, but field
goal and safety give W&L win.

Bottom—Tom Crenshaw works his way into the open after being sprung
by the block of Tom Day (64) as as senior fullback leads Generals on-
slaught.

 

Baker was also the main cause of the Sewanee safety, with aid from|
Logan Bullitt and Jack Kelly. Bullit, Kelly, and Starke Sydnor protected |
the middle as if their lives depended on their stopping enemy ball carriers. |
David, Craig, and Billy Andrews patrolled the defensive backfield like old!
pros with David and Craig batting down important passes. Andrews, all
155 pounds at most just roamed around knocking down stray ball carriers. |

The only play causing distress for the W&L team and fans was when |
Johnson rambled 94 yards with Reading’s kickoff following Brookby’s |
touchdown plunge. There was some question in the press box as to the |
advisibility of kicking deep. There were only a few seconds remaining in
the half, and an onside kick would have been covered by a Sewanee line- |
man with little or no return and with no time for another play.

Reading commented, I put the ball exactly where I wanted it, but John- |
son ran over and took it right out of the hands of the other deep man.” |
Coach Lee McLaughlin took the blame for the mistake in strategy and ad-
mitting at halftime that the thought of an onside kick never occurred to
him, but it would have been a good idea.

Well it was an enjoyable Saturday afternoon, but it is over. Washington |

Generals Beat Tigers 11-6;
Sparks Leads “Team Effort’

By JIM CROTHERS
Tuesday Sports Editor

The unbeaten, nationally-ranked Sewanee Tigers came to
town Saturday and probably wish now that they had stayed
home. Washington and Lee scored a touchdown, a field goal
and a safety, while holding the visitors vaunted ground game
to a mere 2 yards as the Generals stoppe
streak with an 11-6 victory. *

REMAINING GAMES Throughout the second half, W&L

Washington Sewanee, W&L dominated play as they moved the
Sewanee 2 Washington pigskin almost at will, while hold-

Centre season completed period General drive was stopped
short on the Tiger’s 12-yard line,
and Cary Green, who had earlier

 

tried an unsuccessful boot, placed
a perfect field goal from the 12 to
give the Generals a 9-6 lead.

Logie Bullit and Tersh Baker
teamed up to stop Sewanee’s attack
by catching Gignilliat, Tiger quarter-
back, behind the W&L goal for a
safety .This made the score 11-6
with only five minutes remaining.
The Bengal Tigers made a last-ditch
effort to score with their passing
game, but time ran out to give Wash-

in several years.

W&L, who season record now stands
at 3-4, was fullback Tom Sparks.
This sophomore gained 145 yards
in 20 carries with his runs up the
middle.

Coach Cites Team Effort

“It’s hard to pick out a star of
the game,” commented General
coach Lee McLaughlin, “this was
really a team effort.” The “trium-
virate” of Jeff Novinger, Joe Miller
and Billy Andrews was cited by
W&L’s mentor for its tackling, but
McLaughlin pointed out that the de-

Letters To The Editor

(Continued from page 2)

more in keeping with the high level
of thought hopefully prevalent at
W&L. As it stands now, we have
only Mr. Baur’s highly enlightened
personal insight, obtained perhaps
intuitively, concerning such a vast
area as integration at W&L invol-
ves. I cannot conceive of a student
body purportedly guided by the per-
sonal convictions of Robert E. Lee
gamboling about in white sheets
and burning crosses—and this is a
most common result of the line of
thought inherent in Mr. Baur’s argu-
ment.

I agree with Mr. Baur when he
says that one should not recruit
colored students just because they
are Negroes. However, his advice
for the students that do so to enroll
in Hampton Institute is petty, and
again, irrational. He assumes the role
of one who knows what is best for
W&L, when it has been so clearly
demonstrated that the Board of
Trustees, who know a little more of
the matter than Mr. Baur, think dif-
ferently.

I prefer to heed the decision of
these gentlemen, and in the spirit
of Mr. Baur’s letter advise him to
go elsewhere if he feels his personal
interests cannot exist within the
decisions governing aspects of our
life here at W&L.

JERRY COFFMAN

The Editor

The enthusiastic spirit at last Sat-
urday’s football triumph was as-
tonishing. For once the student body
was not too sophisticated to cheer
for the team and the results are
evident. Perhaps if this spirit could
be continued, W&L could again have
nationally
sports other than soccer, which
could benefit from a good show of
support from the student body be-
fore making its bid for the NCAA
championship.

To the Editor:

This letter should not be headed as
it is, but rather “Dear Students of
Washington and Lee,” for its con-
tents have to do with all of us who
partcipated in the events this week-
end. Anyway, no matter what the
title is or could be, I could not help
but sit down and write what fol-
lows...

A little over a week ago I wrote
an article concerning the spirit, or
rather, lack of spirit on the W&L
campus—much to my delight I saw
and heard spirit in its contagious
form on Saturday. Not only was
there spirit in the homecoming dec-
orations, but at the pep rally (per-
haps some became overzealous)
and, where it became most evident,
at the game. For the first time in
my three years on this campus did
I actually hear the crowd, they even
frequently stood up, and several in
the assemblage were “obnoxious”
enough to bring noisemakers such as
a cowbell, and some horns! We have
thanks to give to our cherleaders
from “The Hill,” and to a certain
“jolly ol’ soul” in the guise of one
R. E. Lee who popped up out of
nowhere!

The weekend has ended, and we,
the student body, can give ourselves
a pat on the back, for not only did
our representatives on the field give
us something to cheer about, but we
reciprocated by showing our enthus-
iasm for their endeavors. We de-
feated a strong team which is per-
haps our strongest opponent in the

conference (fortunately, Susque-
is not in our conference!).
The schedule shows two more

games; next week’s is away, but the
last game of the season is at home
against Washington University.

little effort. With a degree it is
easy to get a upper middle class
job which will make few exces-

sive demands on us.

In other words, there is little that
we have to do. For us to be active,
energetic, enthusiastic, or creative

 

requires for us to consciously de-
decide to be. We have to force our-|
selves to do what our fathers were |
forced to do. This is, to be sure, a}
paradoxical problem. But it is one
which is bound to plague us more |
and more as our society finds in-|
creasingly better ways to make life |
easy for us.

This easy life we are producing,
so it seems, is not an easy one at all. |
For if it is to be full, creative, and!
active, that is, if it is to be happy, |
we must force it to be that way.

LF.C. will have acquired a general
booking agent in order to bring less
expensive and more reliable combos
and entertainment to the campus.

The only problem seemed to con-
cern the means of these ends, It is
my judgment that the “shenanigans”
of the past are of the past and, as a
result, the tone of future articles will
reflect the proper spirit of this or-
ganization.

It also appears that the general con-
census of opinion on behalf of the
representatives supports this column-
ist’s actions which certainly gives me
a reprieve until next week at least.

Following the game the respec-

and the Rhythm Makers entertained

in Red Square. The evening brought
the usual combo parties highlighted
by Maurice Williams and the Zodi-
acs at Phi Psi.

To add to the weekend’s success,
the once-beaten soccer team received
a bid to represent the South at the
NCAA championships in Boston on

In assessing the campaign then,
Chuck Percy did remarkably well.
In essence he was trying to over-
come a 900,000 vote deficite. That

he came as close as he did is a |

remarkable achievement in itself.

His campaign was essentially a
good one. He had an outstanding
staff and a devoted group of vol-
unteers. His organization and at-
tention to details were also impres-
sive.

Percy was also criticized that he
did not put enough emphasis on the
conflict of interest charges in the
Kerner administration against Theo-
dore Isaacs, Kerner’s campaign
manager. Some people felt that if
Percy had hit upon this issue, he
would have had a larger margin
downstate than 60,000 votes. The
scandal had received scant mention
downstate in comparison to Cook
County.

Besides the Isaacs scandal, Percy
had little ammunition to work with,
except that he would be a bettter
and more effective governor. Voters
had to accept this promise. Over
two million did but Chuck’s luck,
as many called it finally ran out.
Yet the widely-held opinion is that

grew in assurance, warmth, and po-

that his long range political future
is still extremely bright.

Percy may have won his spurs
in the million dollar gubernatorial
campaign, and he may yet apply
the skills and experience to making
the trip that will take him to
Washington. Our country needs
men of his caliber providing lead-
ership in both parties. I am confi-
dent Chuck Percy will be the man,
He faces many challenges ahead,
but this man thrives on challenges.
As I left his headquarters Wednes-
day morning, I could not help but
notice that there was still an en-
thusiasm aglow in the bleary eyes
of his supporters that may put
him in the right seat yet.

Chuck Percy will be a rallying
point for a Republican party that
needs drastic help both in Illinois
and in the nation. He will step down
soon from his executive leadership
in Bell and Howell and devote his
time to public life.

New Agency

For Combos

MayBeHired

In an effort to provide higher
caliber bands for lower prices at
fraternity combo parties, IFC So-
cial Chairman Ed Allen has tenta-
tively made plans for an additional
agent to handle bookings.

All contracts except for local town
groups are presently arranged by
Ted Hall, as they have been for
some time now. His service handles
such groups as Maurice Williams, the
Delacardos, and the Chevies. Ac-
cording to Allen, however, many
houses have recently complained
of his comparatively higher prices
and poor service. In addition, Ted
Hall has allegedly often charged dif-
ferent houses for the same band.

Allen says these complaints are
not new and began last year. To try
to curb this, he contacted Spotlight
Attractions of Richmond. This agen-
cy is the Southern representative
of a New York booker and has avail-
able many of the big name bands not
possible for oridnary combo week-
ends.

Their rates are comparatively low-
er than those of Ted Hall and special
prices are given if the same band
is contracted for more than one
weekend appearance.

By placing these two agencies in
competition against one another,
W&L should be able to secure bet-
ter bands of a greater variety at
lower prices and in a more efficient
business attitude.

A student committee would be set
up to deal with the agencies in
contracting various bands, thus eli-
minating individual contact with
them. Allen emphasized that this
would also provide a greater cen-
tral organization in addition to the
tangible benefits.

Outcome of a meeting held this
afternoon with the two agencies
will be announced sometime next
week.

 

 

 

Alumni House
Is Approved

By Trustees

By STEVE SAUNDERS

The home of the late Dr. Fitz-
gerald Flournoy, formerly Profes-
sor of English has been approved as
the Washington and Lee Alumni
House by action of the Alumni-
ni Board of Trustees this past
weekend. According to Mr. William
Washburn, Executive Secretary of
the Alumni Association, each board
member was given a set of the pre-
liminary plans for renovating the
Flournoy home on which to suggest
revisions, which must be returned
by next Saturday.

New plans will then be drawn up
by the University architects, Clark,
Nexsen and Owen of Lynchburg,
incorporating the suggested revi-
sions. “If the cost of renovation has
not become infeasible at that point,”
said Mr. Washburn, “then the con-
tract for the construction will be let.”

Features included in the prelimi-
nary plans include the addition of
porches on three sides of the Flour-
nory home to accommodate heavy
crowds, and two large reception
rooms on the first floor, flanking a
sizeable foyer. Alumni offices will
have to be located upstairs, These fa-
cilities will include space for the
addressograph and other heavy
working machines, an alumni board
room, alumni lounge. and a new ol-
fice for the Executive Secretary.

The current plans will result in
an almost entirely new interior
Floor boards will be replaced, as will
the wall plaster. A new heating
plant and air conditioning unit will
be installed

This is the first Alumni House
Washington and Lee University has
had. For many years, the alumni
office was located in an old building
located on the present site of the
Student Union. When that structure
was demolished to make way for
the Student Union, the alumni office
moved to its present quarters im
Washington Hall

Other business considered at the
Board meeting this weekend
was the publication of the Alumni
directory. Mr. Washburn said that
the directory will be ready for dis-
tribution sometime in January 1965
it has been in preparation since last

June

Political Experts Analyze Election;
Results, Future Discussed By Panel

An Analysis of the 1964 Elections!
was the topic of the round table

discussion sponsored by Pi Sigma
Alpha, the national political sci-
ence fraternity. last Wednesday at
7:30 p.m. in duPont Hall.

Dr. C. F. Phillips and Dr. E. L.
Pinney of the W&L political science
department, Maj. Campbell, profes-
sor of history at VMI, and Mr. C.
Davidson, county Democrat spoks-
man, presented their views on the
quality of the campaign and likely
trends for 1968.

Much of the discussion centered
around the future of the Republican
Party. Mr. Davidson foresaw an up-
hill climb for the GOP for several
years to come unless some unusual
national disaster, such as a depres-
sion, occurs.

Dr. Phillips, calling the moderate
Republican losses on the local level
“the greatest tragedies of the cam-
paign,” said, “The party is not dead
in any sense of the word. But it is
hurt. The problem now is to fight
and rebuild for the future.

Dr. Pinney added that moderate
Republicans would now demand and
win back control of the party to its
former leaders. Maj. Campbell
agreed: A party that can win 36 per
cent of the vote is not dead.”

Following the formal discussion,
an informal question and answer
period took place.

Established at W&L in 1954, the

al years before being reactivated

series of discussions throughout the
year and initiation of eligible stu-
dents at the end of the semester.

Oceanographer Pratt
Speaks To Geologists

Dr. Richard Pratt of the Woods
Hole Oceanographic Institute spoke
here today on the nature of the
ocean floor off the Atlantic Coast and
the major trends of oceanography
in today’s scientific world.

Invited here as a guest of the
Geology Department, Dr. Pratt told
listeners at an 11:10 a.m. lecture
about the varied features to be found
on the ocean floor. An area imme-
diately off the North American
eoastcoast, Dr. Pratt explained, is a
submerged portion of the continent
which was flooded at the close of the

last ice age due to the melting
of the ice sheets.
The sea floor is further dotted

with large canyons and submarine
voleanoes. Exploration and mapping

bered for his portrayal of the Em-
peror in last spring’s Dr. Faustus,
interprets the title role of Antonio,
the merchant of Venice. Antonio is
a man of wealth, but also of gen-
erosity; a character of princely dis-
position, “,,.an unwearied spirit in
the doing of courtesies.”

Shylock, the embittered usurer
who by his malice almost destroys
Antonio, is portrayed by Lew Davis.
The role is a change for Davis, who
has made most of his Troubadour
appearances in comic roles.

Charlie Bright, the president of
the Troubadours, plays Bassanio,
the irresponsible, handsome young
friend of Antonio, whose need for
money almost leads to disaster. Play-
ing opposite Bright will be Mrs. Mar-
tha Evans, the wife of Dr. John
Evans of the W&L English depart-
ment. She will make her debut with
the Troubs as Portia, the wealthy,
witty, intelligent heiress whose love
Bassanio wins.

Nerissa, Portia’s maid and confi-
dante, is portrayed by Kendall Jam-
ison, a senior at Lexington High and
a veteran Troubadour actress.

Mare Rehr, who won the Troub
freshman award last year for his
performance in Androcles and the
Lion, plays Gratiano, the talkative
and mercurical companion of Bas-
sanio.

Jan Parham acts the part of Shy-
lock’s daughter Jessica, a free spirit
who finds life in her father’s austere
household a tedious hell.. Launcelot
Gobbo, the omnipresent Elizabethian
fool, is played by Lock Handley, an
experienced actor in low comic roles
at W&L.

Not to be overlooked is Tubal,
Shylock’s friend, who is played by
the impossible to overlook Dr. Keith
Shillington, making his annual ap-
pearance on the Troubadour stage.

Dr. Cecil Jones, the director and
advisor of the Trowbadours, had an
especially large job to do in this
show, as Shakespeare's plays have
few explicit stage directions; but
with Dr. Jones’ past record, full
confidence may be placed in the
success of the production. Special

Troubs Open Season Wednesday
Presenting “Merchant of Venice’

Continuing the celebration of the 400th anniversary of William Shakespeare and Christo-
pher Marlowe, the Troubadours will present Shakespeare’s Merchant of Venice as their next
production. The show will be given Wednesday through Saturday of next week at the Trouba-
dour Theatre. Curtain time each night will be at 8:15.

This comedy, though it borders on tragedy until the last act, is one of the merriest of
Shakespear's comedies. It will be presented by a corps of veterans of the Troubadour stage.

 

ing who designed the sets for this
show.

The drama begins when Bassanio
asks Antonio for money to aid him
in his wooing of Portia. Antonio,
ever ready to help his friends, bor-
rows the money from Shylock des-
pite Shylock’s seemingly playful de-
mand for a pound of Antonio’s flesh
should he be unable to repay the
loan.

Bassanio’s wooing succeeds, but
Antonio’s business ventures fail un-
expectedly and Shylock goes to

 

court to demand his pound of flesh.
But Portia, disguised as a lawyer,
arrives in time to save the day.
Shylock is left broken and defeated
while the others end the play in a
round of joking, merrymaking, and
weddings. Thus a cheerful and spirit-
ed finale closes this often tensely
dramatic comedy.

Tickets for the show will be avail-
able at the door. But season ticket
holders as well as others wishing
to see the play should call HO 3-2181,
extension 273, for reservations.

 

Tutoring Program Reestablished
Under UCA, Hodges’ Direction

The University Christian Associa-
tion is continuing a tutoring service
begun last year. The UCA, under
the guidance of Dr. Louis Hodges,
has compiled a list of tutors available
to W&L students and has set up the
program in the same way as it was
handled last year.

Each year, Dr. Hodges explains,
many students who are obviously
able to do well in their courses fail
for reasons other than lack of abil-
ity. The UCA in an attempt to
curb these failures had made up
the list of tutors who are willing to
help students with academic prob-
lems at no cost.

From the faculty, the Association
acquired a list of students who, in
the opinion of the appropriate pro-
fessors, were able to give help in
a specific subject.

From this list the UCA selected
a number of students who were then
contacted and asked if they cared
to volunteer their services. The
names of the students who replied
affirmatively were then placed on a
list which was mimeographed and
given to freshmen, faculty advisors,
fraternity presidents, and the deans
of the various schools.

Dr. Hodges has pointed out that
the tutors are not only useful to
the failing students, but also to the
student who, although his grades are
not extremely low, feels that they
are definitely below what they
should be, and is willing to work for
the grades he desires.

The tutors are free to withhold
such services from those students
who rely too heavily upon the tutor,
those who seem not to benefit aca-
demically, or those who do not ap-
ply themselves during the tutoring
sessions.

The list of tutors and their re-
spective subjects are as follows:

Biology: Chip Roadman, Charles
Myers.

Chemistry: John Neergaard, Phil
Manor

English: Shannon Jung, Fred Min-
del.

French:
Davis.

Tony Outhwaithe, Tom

 

Geology: Chip Roadman, John
Clegg.
German: Kirk Follo, John C.

Moore, Mel Lapes.
Greek: Jim Steen, Mike Saunders.
History: Gus DuBus, Craig Cotton.
Latin: Scott Snowden, Joe Seay.
Mathematics: Chris Kell.
Philosophy: Sam Ansell,
Vaughn.
Physics: Jim Legg, David Broad-
dus.
Spanish: Sam Ansell, Richard Riv-
era.

Kiwanians Plan
Operetta Here

The Lexington Kiwanis Club is
planning to present another Gilbert
and Sullivan operetta this year.
Presentation of “Iolanthe” this spring
has been proposed, consisting of an
entirely local cast as did last year’s
production “H.MS. Pinafore.”

Those people who worked on
“Pinafore” last year—Lexingtonians,
county residents, W&L students and
faculty, and VMI cadets and faculty
—constitute an immediate working
group. However, new support is
both needed and welcomed. No pre-
vious singing experience is neces-
sary rather the emphasis is on en-
thusiasm.

Interested W&L students may see
Professor David B. Dickens in du-
Pont 209 (Ext. 237) for further infor-
mation.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi
Friday Edition
Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

What Has Happened?

It is an embarrassing fact but so far this year there has been
a discipline problem at the weekly IFC meetings. The pre-
vailing attitude has been one of complete indifference. The
supposedly responsible students elected to be representatives
to the IFC have attempted to make a travesty of the whole af-
fair, and what has been accomplished has been solely through

the hard work of the IFC’s leaders.

The attitude prevalent at the weekly meetings resulted
first in what came to be an IFC “humor column” in the Tues-
day paper and last Monday night resulted in a lecture to the
IFC membership which one might expect to receive as a soph-
omore in high school but never as a supposed leader in a
school of leaders. Last Monday’s lecture was given by Dean
Atwood. He was apparently as embarrased to give it as the
IFC was to hear it. It came though as the inevitable result of
numerous inexcusable acts of immaturity on the part of mem-
bers of the IFC and the fraternities which they represent.

The events last Monday night are disturbing in the light
of the prestige which the IFC had at the end of last year.
Tt was a long hard climb, but, by the end of last year, the IFC
had become the second most respected body on campus. It
stood second only to the Executive Committee. This was true
not only from the stand point of the students who, like it or
not found themselves more under the power of the IFC, but
also from the point of view of the administration who had so
much confidence in the IFC that they returned to it the long
lost power of judicial control over fraternities. The changes
that took place last year were monumental in the light of gen-
eral decline of administrative support for fraternities across
the country.

Art Broadus, last year’s president of the IFC, held one of
the most respected positions on campus, and it was primarily
for his work in the IFC that he won the Gilliam Award for
most outstanding senior. He won over such competitors as Bill

Noell who was President of the Student Body.

Because of the prominence and prestige which was at-
tributed to the IFC and its leaders last year, we might well ask,
“What has happened?” What has happened when Dean At-
wood finds it necessary to lecture the IFC for its conduct?
What has happened when each week we have to read a comical
report of the IFC meetings which is unfortunately justified?
What has happened when seven fraternities choose not to show
up for the IFC faculty banquet? What has happened when six
fraternities put up home coming displays which embarrass
the University before townspeople and alumni in direct de-
fiance to pleas from the Alumni Secretary and the Student
Body President? What has happened when twelve fraternities
fail to comply with an order from the Board of Trustees that
they turn in monthly financial statements?

 

We might wonder also what is going to happen, for the
respect which the fraternities have gained over the past few
years in the eyes of the faculty is presently being lost. Dean
Atwood made this explicitly clear.

We of the Friday staff do not wish to point any fingers,
because it would be hypocritical of us to do so. We only ask
the questions, “What has happened?” and “What is going to
happen?”, knowing that the answers are fairly obvious, and
if, after another five or six years, we find that the adminis.
tration has complete control over fraternities on this campus,

we might well ask a third question, “Can we blame them?”

 

Wanted: Student Expression

Throughout the literature that has been written in support
of segregation, we notice one very pertinent characteristic:
It seems that no one has yet made a valid case, supported by
rational and intelligent reasoning, for retaining the nine-
teenth century institution of segregation. This leads us to
wonder if such a case can be made.

Apparently there is some sentiment on this campus which
does support the continuation of this institution. If such a
case can be made by a student or faculty member on this
campus, the Ring-tum Phi would welcome the opportunity of
presenting it to the student body for their critical examina-
tion. If not, we must continue to maintain our opinion that
integration is not only the intelligent, but truly the inevitable,
way of life in the twentieth century.

We challenge those of you who feel otherwise to show
valid reasons backing your opinion. If you do not pick up this
challenge, we must assume that you can’t, with any intellec.
tual integrity, maintain your present stand.

Since the Ring-tum Phi is a vehicle for student expression,
we would extend a welcome to any student who would like to
write either a humor column or some other form of creative
writing for publication. Mail should be addressed to Box 899,
Lexington, or brought to the print shop or to one of the staff
members.

Because we believe that student creative talent should have
a medium through which it can be heard, and because we feel
that the Ring-tum Phi can offer a place (if not a nadequate
one) for such talent, we encourage any students who have
written in the past, or who have now started to write, to sub-
their work,

Political Horizons

 

By BILL BURKE
Political Columnist

That the Republican Party was
defeated is perhaps the understate-
ment of the decade. It was a mam-
mouth Waterloo. The dubiety of the
election results while unpleasant are
nevertheless naked reality. Political-
ly spaking, let’s examine what hap-
pened.

At the outset the GOP was a di-
vided party. Governor Rockfeller
and Ambassador Lodge walked out
of the convention when Goldwater
was nominated. They never re-
turned to the fold. This is not to
say Goldwater would have won with
their support but it is beyond all dis-
pute that Goldwater would have
made a respectable showing if he had
received the 2 to 3 million votes
that they could have delivered.

When the split is added to the
circustances surrounding the LBJ
Millennium, we can understand this
setback. Johnson and the White
House were united in their nuptial
knot as a result of the deplorable
assassination and this elopement was
accommodated by the nostalgic wave
that follows such an event; the pow-

ers of the President are always
helpful and it is interesting to note
that the federal government spent
tax money in a “non partisan” effort
to register voters in Harlem—there
was also a similar “non Partisan”
effort in Rockbridge County to get
out the vote initiated by several
W&L professors; the Communists
averted their attention from the free
world to accomplish the overthrow
of Khrushchev and attempted to
mend ideological differences and the
economy was in an intoxicated hap-
piness. The Messiah was handed his
crown.
Was Conservatism Rejected

There are animated frogs among
us who have crawled upon their
dumbwaiters shrieking that conser-
vatism is dead. They have even of-
fered to pay our burial expenses.
No, thank you. If anyone really be-
lieves that, then our opposition is
not as bright as we had supposed.
For those Conservatives who are dis-
comforted, they have every right to
be, but an examination of history
might be helpful. The party now in
in England lost by a margin greater

 

than Goldwater’s only five year’s

An Informed Warning

There is a new species of carnivore in the Lexington area. We print

this as a warning to all students. This new species is a peculiarly obnox-
ious sort. He is crafty, merciless, and cruel. He roams about both day and
night attacking his victims with no warning. (At least the rattlesnake
lets you know he’s about to strike.) There is only one defense that has
proved effective against this merciless breed and that is to not carry
cigarettes. Unfortunately, though, such practices have only seemed to
increase the numbers of this species now commonly known as Buttus
bummerus.

ago. In 1924, the Democrats lost by
a parallel margin, just eight years
before they began to rule for a
generation. We may have lost one
chance, but there shall be others.

It was not Conservatism but rath-
er what was interpreted as “Gold-
water conservatism” that was reject-
ed. To the masses, Goldwater was
pictured as a warmonger, racist, fac-
iast, and a danger to society. The
primary issue in the campaign should
have been whether we should have
more or less government and the ne-
cessity for a definite foreign policy,
but this was never suffused to the
American voter. The major elements
of Conservatism are based upon
sound economic policies and an at-
tempt at success in foreign affairs.
That is to say we do not believe in
spending two dollars if we only have
one. Nor do we believe that the loss
of 800 million people to Communism
in the last 20 years constitutes suc-
cess.

The Future

The Republican Party must broad-
en its base. In the minds of those
who oppose us, they suppose the
G.O.P. is a private club for the
elite. Indeed, our membership was
exclusive on November 3. But this
notion could not be further from
the truth.

We must continue the educational
process just recently begun. The bat-

 

Burke Explains Defeat, Predicts GOP Future

tle ultimately will be won or lost
on the validity of our ideas, not on
the ability of Liberals to distort our
candidates. Conservatives must en-
ter the fields of education, religion,
and journalism. The Liberals have
been doing it for years.

The Republican party must estab-
lish a nucleus of professional politi-
cians. This is evident from the last
three campaigns. Nixon established
his own group of workers in his
two ventures leaving the Republi-
can National Committee void of
power and Goldwater appointed his
own people within the National
Committee. This was necessary in all
three instances because the National
Committee was disorganized and
unused. This professional nucleus
is exactly what is now being estab-
lished in Washington. And whether
a candidate be a moderate or a con-
servative, they shall run the future
campaigns.

Senator Goldwater’s future poses
several alternatives. He can retire
from politics, regroup and strive for
the 1968 nomination, or remain as a
constructive, active force within the
party but not its head. The third
alternative is the most probable.
Senator Goldwater will remain the
head of a large, conservative portion
of the Republican Party. In this role
he will run for Carl Hayden’s seat
and be returned to the Senate.

 

‘Fail-Safe’ Considers Problem
Of Ending Accidental Warfare

By JAMES JENNINGS
Cinema Columnist

Most major movie critics have
amused themselves recently by ridi-
culing “Fail-Safe” on the grounds
that the whole thing is absurd from
the acting to the plot. I am glad
that these critics of such percep--
tion spend their time misinterpreting
movies and not international poli-
tics. “Fail-Safe” is not a good movie
from the standpoint of symbolic,
sociological overtones, and maybe
even acting, but it does present a
situation which one cannot shrug
off as one would “The Day the
Earth Caught Fire.” Admittedly,
after laughing through “Dr. Strange-
love,” one is reluctant to take the
drama and rash statements of “Fail-
Safe” seriously.

‘Tempted to Laugh’

In the tradition of “Strangelove,”
one wold be tempted to laugh at the
political scientist, who presents a
point of view that is being seriously
considered. One wants to laugh at
some of the dialogue between the
President and the Soviet Premier,
but one wrong word or slight mis-
understanding could end such a con-
versation. The irony of some of
the statements leaves the viewer with
no choice but to laugh, and some
of the irony leaves the viewer with
a funny feeling in his stomach.

The situation in “Fail-Safe” is one
to be considered. Miscalculation
could very easily trigger a nuclear
war or even a power failure might.
The movie intends to show us that
we have outdone ourselves in our
military development, but now we
have to live with this development
and find some way to utilize it with-
out destroying the world. If it means
we must sacrifice a city to preserve
ourselves and the rest of the world,
then it must be done according to
“Fail-Safe.”

Many Ways

There are many ways for a nu-
clear war to start and there have
been many books and movies deal-
ing with the problem of total war.
“Fail-Safe” is one way to start and
maybe stop war. “On the Beach”
is another and is just as probable in
the future. The movie makers have
taken it upon themselves to exploit
the possibilities in a situation that
is frightning, frustrating and fasci-

 

nating. So far, most of these movies
have been good and have provoked
needed thought in people. “Fail-
Safe” is a success because it makes
me think about what man has done
and what machins in the hands of
man can do to man.

Students Dress
Part OF W&L

By WARREN MONTGOMERY
Feature Editor

The approaching referendum on
the future powers of the Assimilation
Committee will pose to each stu-
dent this question—What does con-
ventional dress mean to you?

To answer this question, let us
ask another—What Makes Wash-
ington and Lee a distinctive univer-
sity? What is the difference be-
tween it and most colleges? The
difference cannot be stated in one
sentence or even in concrete terms.
Washington and Lee has a certain
atmosphere about it—a feeling of
past generations and present aca-
demic excellence, of honor, tradition,
and the aristocratic ideal.

How can one contemplate the
University without a sense of awe
and smallness in the presence of a
thing greater than himself? Regard
the beautiful Washington Hall group.
George Washington built it, Gen-
eral Lee once walked under these
very columns. Fifty yards down the
hill, in the Chapel, lies the body of
Lee himself—probably one of the
most noble, honorable, brave, and
just men who ever lived.

Precious few universities have
this sort of atmosphere, an atmos-
phere capable of inspiring men to-
ward high ideals and excellence of
character. How should this excel-
lence manifest itself in Washing-
ton and Lee students? It should
give them a certain sense of per-
sonal dignity as the heirs and per-
petuators of two centuries of great-
ness.

Conventional dress is certainly not
not the vital cornerstone of W&L
spirit. It is , however, a substantial
support of it, for conventional dress
enhances the personal dignity of
each student who wears it. How?

Ball control was the General booters’ main problem as the
Wahoos put the pressure on and kept it there. W&L’s fine rear

guard prevented any scoring until 93 15 of the second quarter,
when Bill Forrester boomed a shot*—————

in from ten feet out to put the
Cavaliers in front.

The Generals meanwhile were un-
able to mount a consistent attack,
as UVa.’s outstanding goalie Billy
Ray kept turning occasional bril-
liant plays by Brad Shinkle and Tim
Henry into near misses.

The third quarter saw more of
the same. Ken Harvey got the Wa-
hoos their second score as he nudged
in a cross from Forrester with
eight minutes gone. W&L coach Joe
Lyles immediately pulled out most
of his first-string line; but the sec-
ond team had no better luck con-
taining the red-hot Cavaliers.

Harvey got his second goal of
the day, on a fine shot which angled
sharply over the head of sub goalie

 

Despite his injury Coach
praised Shinkle’s play,
that of Henry and the outstanding
fullback corps of Dave Redmond,
Pete Preston, and Howard Busse.
And he said that he thinks his boot-
ers are actually better than either
UVa. or American U., who de-
feated the Generals earlier.

The loss dropped W&L to second
seeding behind UVa. for the VISA
tournament. Both teams have iden-
tical records of 4-1 in state compe-
tition, but the Wahoos drew top
billing on more goals scored. The
Generals retain their first-round
bye, though, and will play for the
first time tomorrow afternoon when
they meet the winner of today’s
game between Randolph-Macon and

Play Here Tomorrow

Washington and Lee’s freshman
football team wil be at home tomor-
row as the Brigadiers try for their
first victory of the season in a 2:30
game against Randoph-Macon’s
freshmen at Wilson Field.

Th Baby Generals go into this
game with a record of no wins, four
losses and one tie. W&L lost their
last game to Fork Union Military
Academy, 20-0. This will be W&L’s
last game of the season.

The varsity cross-country team
will be looking for their sixth vic-
tory of the season against one loss
when they face the harriers of Fair-
mont College tomorrow at 3:30 on
the W&L course.

Last week the General harriers
took third place in the state cross-
country meet at the VMI course.
W&L was third with 97 points be-
hind winning William and Mary with
23 and VMI with 33. The Generals
did avenge their only loss of the
season to Bridgewater by finishing
ahead of the Eagles who came in
fifth with 137 points behind Old
Dominion who had 116.

Generals Play

Southwestern

In CAC Game

By JOHNNY GRAHAM

The Washington and Lee football
team is back in the running for
the College Athletic Conference
football championship.

Last Saturday’s 11-6 upset of
CAC frontrunner Sewanee installed
the Generals as a definite title pos-
sibility. With two CAC games re-
maining, wins in both will assure the
Generals of at least a tie for the
championship.

The chances for sole possession
of the top spot are slim according
to General coach Lee McLaughlin.
These chances hinge upon a tie in
the Washington-Sewanee game this
Saturday and General wins in the
next two games.

Washington presently leads the
standings with a 2-0 mark followed
by Sewanee with a 2-1 record. The
Generals have lost to Centre and
beaten Sewanee for a 1-1 mark and
third place.

Tomorrow’s game with southwest-
ern of Memphis is a must game in
the title race. The Lynx are 1-2 in
conference competition, having lost
to Washington and Sewanee. Mc-

English Seminar

Features Poet,

Miller Williams

By PETER WITT
“Poetry for the Non-Poetry
Reader” was the subject of the
fiftieth Washington and Lee
Lee Seminar in Literature con-

ducted last night by Miller

Williams, poet and member of
the English faculty at Louisiana State
University.

Williams’ own title for the talk was
“Nobody here plays the piano, but we
like to have it in the house.” He sug-
gested that poetry has become to most
people a useless ornament similar to

oo in the living room which no- Py. Miller Williams talks with students after his lecture Monday

play.
Get a Radio

“Poetry has been an ornament so
long that we no longer understand it,”
he said. Continuing the comparison
with the piano, he said people ought to
either “trade the piano for a radio,”
or learn to play it.

From infancy children are hindered
from appreciating poetry, said Wil-
liams. “We cripple the poet and the
child” when we teach them to expect
answers to all the questions. Teach-
ers and textbooks, the poet said, teach
only literature with “morals to them,”
literature which must be acceptable to
the “Daughters of Everything.”

Neatnik Poems

This type of literature Williams
characterized by the “Neatnik” poems
which are counterfeit with rhythm and
rhymes and a ribbon of sweetness, and
have a label which says, “Caution
contains truth.”

Mr. Williams characterized failings
in poetry which prevent people from
understanding good poetry when they
see it. The first failing he singled out
was sentimentalism, which tries to
make the shallow important.

“Push-Button Poetry”

“Push-button emotionalism” is the
use of worn-out phrases which im-
mediately call up a worn-out response
from the reader. Mr. Williams gave
several examples of “grotesques,”
which is his term for a type of bad
metaphor. The grotesque is something
which “if you painted they wouldn't
let you hang.”

At the end of his lecture Mr. Wil-
liams answered questions from the
audience. The seminar was followed
by coffee in duPont Hall, outside the
auditorium.

Williams has been awarded a Bread
Loaf Fellowship in poetry and received
the Amy Lowell Travelling Scholar-
ship for 1963-64. He has recently pub-
lished the first volume of his poetry,
which has appeared in many literary
magazines including the W&L review,
Shenandoah.

Notice

The Executive Committee of the
Faculty has set a two-day limit as
the maximum time allowed any stu-
dent wishing to leave school for
work before the Christmas holidays.
The student must be in attendance at
classes on the day before he leaves
to accept employment

Mock Trial

Washington and Lee University
law students took over Rockbridge
County’s court room today to stage
the School of Law’s annual mock
trial.

Student lawyers will argue a
complicated civil case before Judge
Jack M. Matthews of Virginia's 21st
Judicial Circuit, which includes
Grayson, Wythe, Pulaski, and Car-
roll counties.

Judge Matthews’ participation
marks the first time in recent years
that a judge, and not a law pro-
fessor, has heard the mock trial
case.

Another innovation this year will
be the 12-member jury panel made
up of Lexington townspeople, instead
of other law students.

Law senior Jim Bowie of Galax,
mock trial chairman, hopes the lay
jury will render a more impartial
verdict than has come from student
juries in the past. “Law students on
the jury tend to evaluate the case
in terms of what they know or think
they know about the law,” he ex-
plains. “A jury of laymen will offer
a more realistic viewpoint.”

Because the mock trial is expect-
ed to draw a number of spectators,
its location has been shifted from
the customary moot court facilities
of Washington and Lee's Tucker Hall
to the main court room at the Rock-
bridge County Court House.

The case involves an action for
property damage and personal in-
jury arising from an accident caused
by a farm animal that strayed onto
the highway. It is similar to an ac-
tual case recently heard in Halifax
County Cireuit Court, Bowie says.

Arguments for both sides will be
| handled by teams of three student
| lawyers each.

 

| Chief defense counsel is John L.!

| Kowalski, Jr. of North Falmouth,
| Mass. He will be assisted by Sam-
i uel W. Coleman, Hl, of Gate City
land Rudolph Bumgardner, It, of
| Staunton.

| Chief counsel for the plaintiff is

Baremore Is Outstanding Debater
At American University Tourney

A strong showing at a tournament
at American University this past
weekend highlighted an active week
for the Washington and Lee debate
team.

Tom Baremore, a W&L freshman
was chosen as the fourth best speak-
er out of sixty in the Delta Sig-
ma Rho-Tau Kappa Alpha tourney
and also won the award for the top
negative speaker. Sam Frazier placed
third in the After-Dinner Speaker
Contest, part of the same tournament
held on the campus of American
University in Washington, D.C

The four man W&L team consist-
ing of Baremore, Frazier, Bill Grant
and Hal Hiegenbottem, won four
debates in the team competition
while losing the same number

Washington and Lee played host
te four nevice teams in the area last
Wednesday in regional novice
tournament. Teams from Bridge-

a

| water, Randolph-Macon College,
end VPI competed with W&L in
i three rounds of debate. Washington
and Lee novice debaters who took
part in the tournament were Bob
Imholt, Steve Meidner, Bill Tim-
merman and Bob Cogan. The team
from Roanoke College won the
tournament

Next week will again be a busy
week for the W&L varsity team
On Wednesday, Ed Fitzgerald, Kaz
Herchold, John McMurry, and Dave
Marchese will put on a debate ex-
hibition at a high school in Roanoke
Several rounds of practice debate

and Roger D. Kelsey of Smyrna,

Each team of lawyers has been as-
sisted by four research men in pre-
paring arguments.

Witnesses testifying in the case
will be twelve law students and
one wife of a law student.

Bowie says the mock trial offers
valuable court room experience to
participants that is unavailable in
the law classrooms. The mock trial
is classified as a student extra-cur-
ricular activity, but it receives full
backing of the university's law facul-
ty, Bowie adds.

 

Troubadours
Will Present
‘The Merchant’

By KIP ARMSTRONG

At 8:15 Wednesday night the cur-
tains of the Troubadour Theater will
open on the first play of the 1964-65
season, Shakespeare’s most outstand-
ing romantic comedy, The Merchant
of Venice.

Lew Davis, the former comedian,
will play the enigmatic character
of Shylock. Portia, another of
Shakespeare’s eternal creations, will
be played by Mrs. Martha Evans.

Pete Stelling and Charles Bright
complete the cast as Antonio and
Bassanio.

The extensive and rather “extrav-
agant” sets designed by Gay Reading
should go far to create the appro-
priate atmosphere. The entire pro-
duction is decidecated to the 400th an-
iversary of the birth of Shakespeare.

Also of interest will be the treat-
ment of the contrasting worlds of
Vience and Belmont. A decidedly
different atmosphere surrounds each
of them. Belmont supports a theme
of romance and joy, while Venice,
the site of an attempted murder, is
ruled by money and prejudice.

The Trowbadours have spared no
effort in making this production
worthy of the significant occasion.
For reservations through Saturday
night call the box office at 463-2181,
ext. 273.

The supporting cast includes many
veterans of past Troubadour pro-
ductions. Lock Handley has one of
the most important of the supporting
parts as Launcelot Gobbo, the fool.
Dr. Keith Shillington is playing the
part of Tubal, friend of Shylock.

Last year, the Troubadours pre-
sented Marlow’s “Faustus” in com-
memoration of his 400 anniversary.

 

Mayfield, Saunders Appointed

Interim Convention Chairmen

The Executive Committee announc-! tional Committee be set up with a

ed last night the appointment of David
Mayfield, sophomore from Durham,
N.C., and Steve Saunders, freshman
from Elmont,, New York, as the Co-
Chairmen of the Mock Convention
Coordinating Committee.

President Jim Kulp stated that the
committee was formed to meet two
immediate problems which require
long range planning. According to
Kulp the committee will be respon-
sible for taking the necesary steps to
obtain a ruling from the Internal Rev-
enue Service to make tax deductable
all donations to the Mock Convention.
In addition the committee will set up

ning and organizing of the Mock Con-

In an interview with the ELC.
Mayfield suggested the possibility of
a national advisory board composed
of key members of the Republican
Party to work with the Coordinating
Committee over the next three years.
In this way Mayfield felt that the
Mock Convention would receive a
great more support from the leaders
of the party and at the same time
benefit from their extensive knowl-
edge.

Steve Saunders stated in his inter-

 

view with the E.C. that an organiza- |
tion similar to the Republican Na-'

number of regional representatives
who would familiarize themselves with
the political “pulse” of these areas
over the next three years in order to
insure accuracy in the 1968 Conven-
tion.

As a member of the 1964 Mock
Convention Secretariat, Mayfield was
assistant to the publicity chairman. He

Committee, assistant to the editor of

Bean To Address
Civil War Club

“Robert E. Lee and the Battle of
Seven Pines” will be the subject of the
meeting of the Washington and Lee
Civil War Round Table scheduled for
Thursday evening, November 19. Dr.
William G, Bean, profesor of history
emeritus, will be guest speaker, ac-
cording to program chairman Steve
Saunders. Second in a projected series
of eight programs, the Thursday night
meeting will be conducted in duPont
105 beginning at 7:30 p.m.

Bean War Expert

Dr. William G. Bean served as head
of the history department from 1930
until his retirement in June 1962. He
had come to Washington and Lee as
an assistant professor in 1922. One of
the foremost authorities on the Civil
War, Dr. Bean is a member of the Vir-
ginia Civil War Commission’s Execu-
tive Committee.

He is a member of the Southern
Historical Asociation and the Virginia
Historical Society, and has written
articles for the South Atlantic Quar-
terly, the New England Quarterly, the
Virginia Magazine of History and
Biography, and the Journal of South-
ern History. In 1959, his most recent
book was published, Stonewall’s Man:
Sandie Pendleton.

Dr. Bean received his A.B. at the
University of Alabama, and both his
M.A. and Ph.D. at Harvard Univer-
sity.

General Robert E. Lee took com-
mand of the Confederate forces at the
Battle of Seven Pines in 1862, and pro-
vided the vigorous leadership which
had only been sporadic previously. For
this reason, Seven Pines is especially
significant. Dr. Bean's treatment of
the battle is expected to be both in-
teresting and enlightening. Students
and faculty are welcome to attend. A
question-and-answer period will fol-
low Dr. Bean's talk.

W&L’'s Civil War Round Table was
formed at the ebginning of this semes-
ter. Dr. Charles W. Turner, professor
of History, is faculty advisor.

* Dr. Spencer, described as a dy-
namic orator, received his A.B. de-
gree from Davidson College in 1940.
Graduating summa cum laude, he
later attended Harvard University
where he earned his M.A., and Ph.D.
degrees. After a brief association
with Vick Chemical Co. and Green-
ville Clark Co. he returned to
Davidson in 1951 to become assist-
ant to the President. He was subse-
quently made Professor of History
and Dean of Students. Leaving
Davidson in 1957, he assumed the
Presidency of Mary Baldwin College.

While studying at Harvard, Dr.
Spencer received an Austin Fel-
lowship, a Rosenwald Fellowship
and a Kent Fellowship from the
National Council on Religion in
Higher Education. A member of
Phi Beta Kappa, Dr. Spencer has
written several books, including
Decision for War 1917 and Booker
T. Washington and the Negro
Place in American Life. He wes
initiated into ODK twenty-five
years ago in Lee Chapel in a spec-
ial service commemorating the
25th anniversary of the leadership
fraternity.

Concerning the selection of Dr.
Spencer as a speaker for the Anni-
versary Assembly, ODK President
Steve Smith commented, “It is very
appropriate that we will be hearing
the President of a neighboring in-
stitution, since W&L students have
little contact with these schools ex-
cept on a very informal social level.”

The assembly will be the fiftieth
in which ODK has chosen members

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Tuesday Edition

Washington, And Lee

The self-analysis which is being conducted by Wash-
ington and Lee this year has as one of its objects of study
the proposed separation of this university into a Washing-
ton College and Lee College. Certainly one of the most
perplexing problems raised by the proposed halving, and
one which should be thoroughly examined by the self-
study group, is the effect which the separation into two col-
leges would have on the character of the student body.

The outstanding characteristic of Washington and Lee
is the body of tradition which has been carefully given and
no less carefully preserved for many student generations.
If Washington College and Lee College were to be twin in-
stitutions, offspring of the present university, they should
naturally be possessed by the same heritage. If we did not
believe this, then we would not believe our traditions are
suitable for preservation in the school as we now have it.
But what would be the effect of transplanting the honor
system to the new college: Can a good honor system be
transplanted at all?

The W&L honor system was not actually “started” at
any one point. It grew and was given form only very grad-
ually. The new college would immediately face the prob-
lem of initiating an honor system from scratch without the
reality of tradition which the present system enjoys.

To transplant tradition to the new college, the univer-
sity would have to transplant a large number of students
from the old Washington and Lee. Tradition cannot be
handed to freshmen without the example of upperclass-
men who can say about the honor system, “Yes, it really
works”; who are there to make it work. But probably
this is the method contemplated by the proponents of the
two-college plan. If so, the problem becomes this: Who
will transfer to the new college? The university would have
to ensure a representative transfer of students, and not al-
low only those students to make the change who have
nothing to give up by a change. A lack of upper-
classmen capable of passing on the honor system would
probably be fatal to it.

Paradoxically, the effect of the separation on tradi-
tions other than the honor system would almost certainly
be invigorating. The experience of most new schools has
been an unusual friendliness which would give a new life
to the speaking tradition. The common bond of a new
adventure should also be in itself the most powerful en-
forcer of conventional dress. But these traditions, though
important, are matters of conformity in outward appear-
ance. The honor system, a moral concern, is something
entirely different. It is, of course, entirely a student matter
insofar as its administration is concerned, But it would
be a mistake for the university to ignore the effects which
such a move as the proposed split would have on the honor
system. A continuum of student tradition may in the lang
run be fully as important as the obligation to the future
which is the reason for considering expansion.

Besides effects on the usually recognized traditions, the
results of separation on the fraternity system are worth
consideration. It is possible that the administration would
seize the moment of transition to abolish fraternities at
both schools. But if the fraternity system at the time is
healthy and receives support from alumni, the most likely
event is that the entire system would be transferred to
the new college. It would be unfortunate if the old stu-
dent body retained a fraternity system and the new col-
lege had none; the result would be two completely dif.
ferent student bodies, with a minimum of things in com-
mon, and perhaps with antipathy toward each other.
The situation would attract different types of applicants
for each college, and would build different types of men
during the college years. It would hinder an effective
intercourse between the two schools, On the other hand,
if the existing W&L fraternity chapters were allowed
to establish chapters on the new campus, a means of con-
stant intercourse would be provided instantly. Such an
exchange would help the new college develop the tradi-
tions which make Washington and Lee a distinctive insti-
tution, and would also help entering classes over some of
the problems which beset any new college students.

We are playing the devil’s advocate in this editorial
because we are frankly skeptical of the Washington-Lee
Colleges idea. Even more than we dislike the snug and
smug comfort of our sheltered community, we fear the
possibility of turning Washington and Lee upside down.
As much as we recognize the university's responsibility
to the multiplying numbers of high school graduates seek-
ing college education, we believe that this responsibility
stops short of dissolving the distinctions which makes
Washington and Lee a great school. The plans may be dis-
tant in the future but consideration of student traditions is
not academic merely for this reason. Instead, this consider-
ation ought to be part of any plans which are made, along
with or even before those of where to build the buildings
and where to get the money. The plan for separate
colleges under one administration has succeeded else-
where, and perhaps it can succeed here; perhaps we are
obligated to enlarge the university's capacity, But in an
expansion, we hope the heritage which makes W&L
worth doubling will not be weakened.

 

 

  
   
       

  

Tired of the usual classical mu-
sic presented nightly by Radio
Washington and Lee? (If you listen
at all.) In a recent, candid inter-
view with Messrs. Ell Betts and
Tim Crowley, your reporter ex-
plored the how, why, and what
that surrounds Radio W&L’s new
weekly radio program: “The World
on Tap.”

R-tP: I wonder if you can tell me,
gentlemen, just what exactly is
“The World on Tap?” In _ other
words, what makes it distinctive
from the other programs presented
on Radio W&L?

Betts: Well, let me say first of all
that that was a mighty stupid ques-
tion, but since you asked it, I guess
I might as well go ahead and an-
swer it. I'd say that the “The World
on Tap” is completely different.
There is one similarity, however.

R-tP: Oh? What’s that?

Crowley: Nobody knows we're on
the air but our mothers.

Betts: But that doesn’t make too
much difference because reception
gets kind of fuzzy past the Liquid.

R-tP: Say, Mr> Betts, I notice that
you speak with somewhat of a drawl.
You wouldn’t be from Texas, would
you?

Betts: Yeah. Say, I notice that you
talk with a rather pronounced speech
defect. You wouldn’t be from the
Ring-tum Phi, would you?

Some “Mighty Stupid Questions”

 

Paper Attempts to Interview
‘Radio W&L’ Comedy Team

By Charles Newman

R-tP: Tell me. How did you come
to produce the “World on Tap”
series?

Betts: Well, first we came to Reid
Hall. Then we went into the first
fioor and looked around for the
radio studio. It wasn’t there.

Crowley: Then we went up to the
second floor and looked for the radio
studio. It wasn’t there either.

R-tP: Seriously now, what in-
spires you to produce this program?

Crowley: You might say we enjoy
laughing at everything sacro-sanct
in the world.

Betts: We satirize anything that’s
current. TV shows commercials,
heads of state, political institutions,
and even everyday situations, plus
occasional interviews with interest-
ing personalities such as Yokohama
Nagasaki, the world famous karate
expert.

R-tP: About how long does each
show last?

Crowley: We're on from 8:05 ‘ul
8:20 every Wednesday night.
ult-tP: And how long does it take
you to compose these programs?

Betts: Oh, anywhere from five to
ten minutes. Of course sometimes
it takes even longer.

R-tP: How large do you estimate
your listening audience to be?

Crowley: About two-hundred
thousand, I guess.

R-tP: Two hundred thousand!

Why that’s amazing!

_ You're pretty amazing your-
seu.
R-tP: Say. I notice that the two of
you are wearing costumes—for ex-
ample that rabbit suit Mr. Crowley
has on. Do you wear these get-ups
when you record your show?

Crowley: Yes. You see, Ell and I
take every role in skits that we do.
We have to portray so many differ-
ent characters that it helps us in
our interpretations if we appear
physically the way we want to sound
to our listeners.

Betts: Don’t you believe him. He
wears that rabbit suit wherever he

goes.
...R-tP: But doesn’t he get assimil-
ated walking around the campus?

Betts: No, man. As long as he’s
got on a tie they can’t touch him.

R-tP: And Mr. Betts, you're
dressed up like a cowboy, I suppose,
with your boots, hat and gun.

Betts: Of course. That’s what I
want to be if I ever grow up.

Crowley: Yeah. And I want to be
a big rabbit when I grow up.

R-tP: But doesn’t it bother you
to live such uninhibited, insincere
lives?

Betts: No. Not in the least. The
day we start taking things seriously
is the day Tim takes off his rabbit
suit.

A Look At Quiet Desperation

 

Finny Praised For ‘Saturday Night’

By WARD BRIGGS
Cinema Columnist

“I am what I am and anybody who
tries to say what I am is a bloody
liar. Only God knows what I am.”
This is the philos-
ophy of Arthur
Seaton as por-
trayed by Albert
_ Finny in “Satur-
' day Night and
Sunday morning”
which played yes-
terday at the Ly-
ric. This was Fin-
ney’s first catapult
ts Hes
brought his sul-
len frown, his
transfixing smile, and his penetrat-
ing gaze to the attention of the inter-
national film audience. He has a fan-
tastie presence on the screen which
comes close to that of Marcello Mas-
troianni in standing at the very
heart of every scene, and making
you constantly aware of this mag-
netic individuality. He superbly
mimics the bourgeois factory work-
ers of modern England, in this
bourgeois protest directed by Karl
Reisz and produced by Tony Rich-
ardson.

Arthur is symbol of quite despera-
tion of the British factory worker

Briggs

who works in the shop for five days
a week and goes to the local pubs
on the weekend. His weekends are
filled with fighting, fishing and a lot
of drinking, leading only to the
dreary Monday morning when he
must return to work. In the shop,
the tools form a contant drone which
is constantly brought to mind when
cars pass in a busy street or a trash
can lid falls. Chained to his job,
Arthur never has hope for advance-
ment and seeks his release by plunk-
ing his neighbor with a BB gun.

Arthur is like a conglomeration of
many small pits with trap doors,
waiting to devour any experience
that befalls him. Every trap door is
constantly open, and with every ex-
perience, getting his friend's wife
pregnant, or getting beaten nearly
to a pulp, Arthur delights in the liv-
ing of life until he faces the threat
of being cramped. The baby looms
as a horrible spectre in his mind
and he abandons the adultress
(Rachel Roberts). After getting
beaten up, he seeks solace from his
girl-friend (Shirley Anne Field)
closing out that part of the world
responsible for his beating (the
cuckolded husband). As he says,
“I'm out for a good time, all the
rest is propaganda.”

Like too few British movies, this

one overcomes several problems of
making movies in England. Those
who wish to make good, intelligent
movies are often plagued by the
economic instabilities of high pro-
duction costs, and lack of actual
fervor and creative interest. In
Britain the film temperature is com-
paratively low as compared to France
and Italy, where films are an accept-
ed art form. In these countries,
novelists, playwrights and scenarists
switch back and forth from one
medium to another without criticism.

Yet with the exception of John
Osborne and a few others, this is
not true in England. British movies
seem to be far too involuted and
distant from the outside world, as
detached from the continental flics
as they tried to be from continental
politics. British audiences feel that
the only wohthwhile novels are
those made in their country, for
only those delve into the true prob-
lems of the world, those of Britain.

“Saturday Nite” has a touch of
this, but the magic of Finney’s act-
ing gives greater depth and authen-
ticity to the movie and in the end
we are left with the epitome of his
philosophy: “Just because I don’t
live like you, don't think that I
don’t enjoy myself.

Burch’s Concept
Of GOP Victory
Called Pyhrric

By STEVE SAUNDERS

In the wake of the Republican dis-
aster on November 3, a number of
GOP leaders have taken to that
brand of optimism which sees victory
in defeat and regeneration in degen-
eration. Not least among these hardy
prophets of The Greater Meaning is
the chairman of the Republican Na-
tional Committee, Dean Burch.
Viewing the lop-sided returns, Burch
cheerfully observed in his own in-
imitable way that the election sig-
naled the emergence of a two-party
system in the South and a “victory
for conservatism.”

Chairman Burch’s sense of pro-
portion is questionable. He puts us
in mind of the words of the Greek
general, Pyhrrus, after an especial-
ly costly battle: “Another such vic-
tory, and we are undone.” If Burch
is allowed to continue planning such
“victories for conservatism,” the Re-
publican party might very well go
the way of the Populist, Socialist
Democratic, and Roosevelt Progres-
sive parties. These parties cam-
paigned not so much to win as to
reduce the plurality of the opposi-
tion. If Burch’s inept leadership con-
tinues, the Republican party will
have as its chief purpose the reduc-
tion of Democratic victory margins
“victories for for conservatism.”

New Jersey Loss

Of what do these “victories” con-
sist? Bureh points with pride to
the election of a Republican con-
gressman in Mississippi. But what
of the loss of control of the New
Jersey Congressional delegation to
the Democrats for the first time in
history. This “voctory” Mr. Burch
doesn’t mention. The defection of
Georgia from the Democratic column
for the first time in history is a
source of great conservative joy.
However, Mr. Burch overlooks the
fact that Vermont went Democratic
for the first also.

Burch waxes eloquent on the
Murphy win in the California sen-
atorial race, but what does he have
to say about the senatorial cam-
paigns in New York, or Ohio? He is
ecstatic over Republican Daniel J.
Evan’s. victory over incumbent
Washington Governor Albert
(“Rosy”) Rossellini, a Democrat. The
defeat of Goldwater-aide Richard
Kleindeinst in Arizona does not ex-
cite the same effusiveness.

Burch thinks, to be sure, in terms
of Greater Meaning Of It All.
Twenty-five million votes, consider-
ed per se, is an impressive number
of citizens opting for Goldwater
conservatism. When considered,
though, next to Johnson's thirty-
eight million votes, it is puny. But
it is a victory for conservatism, we
are assured.

The full impact of the Democratic
sweep cannot be felt until one looks
at the local and state elections. And
this is where Burch’'s “victories”
hurt the Republican party most.
New York's legislature, Republican
for 28 years, went Democratic. Six-
seven-, eight-, and nine-term Rep-
resentatives were defeated through-
out the Northeast by political neo-
phytes. Young beat Taft, Kerner
beat Percy, and in Oklahoma, State
Senator Fred Harris trounced Re-
publican Bud Wilkinson, who had
been favored to win. Thanks to
Burch's “victories for conservatism,”
the Republicans are now the weak-
est “major” party since the Whigs.

Grenier Due Credit

It can't all be blamed on Burch.
John Grenier, erstwhile Alabama
GOP leader, can be credited with
urging the expenditure of fantastic
amounts of money on local congres-
sional and state-wide races in Ala-
bama, Florida, Mississippi, Louis-
jana, South Carolina, and George.
As one of Burch's top staffers, Gren-
ier channeld streams of money to
Republican office-seekers in these
states, reducing the funds for East-
ern and Midwestern candidates to
a trickle. Pennsylvania's peppery Re-
publican Senator Hugh Scott felt
the bind, and was the first to ac-
cuse the national committee of dis-
criminating against Eastern candi-
dates by withholding money. Seott
cried foul and Burch pleaded econ-
omy. A “victory” for sound finance,
no doubt.

If ever a Republican national
chairman deserved to be removed,
Dean Burch is that man. When the
National Committee meets on Jan-
uary 10, it would be well-advised to
remove Burch and clear out his
“vietory”-minded crew. Idaho Gov-
ernor Smylie would make an ex-
cellent chairman; he is personable,
capable, a militant moderate, and—
hopefully—acceptable to both lib-
erals and conservatives.

Burch’'s imposed leadership of the
National Committee has been repu-
diated in dozens of state, in thou-
sands of precinets, and by millions

Generals Blank Lynx For Third Straight
Booters Place 2nd In State; ‘Record Now 8-2-1

Kickers Prepare
For NCAA Play

By BOB CARTER
Tuesday Sports Writer

Washington and Lee’s soccer team
defeated Randolph-Macon, 3-2, and
tied the University of Virginia, 2-2,
to gain a second place finish in
the Virginia Intercollegiate Soccer
Tournament held at Lynchburg Col-
lege on Saturday.

The Generals gained an opening
round bye because of their second
place seeding behind the University
of Virginia. In the semifinals the
Generals were able to turn back
Randolph-Macon with a strong of -
fensive show and an alert defense,
Center forward Tim Henry and left
inside Dave Kirkpatrick each scored
a goal in the second quarter while
wing Wes Horner tallied the last
W&L goal in the fourth quarter.

Cavaliers Win Tourney
Although Washington and Lee
tied UVa., the Cavaliers won the
tournament on the number of corner
kicks by an advantage of 7-4. The
Generals led the Cavaliers 2-0 at
the end of the first quarter, but the

Generals simply ran out of steam*

Goals by Tim Henry and win Wes
Horner gave the Generals the 2-0
advantage but Virginia bounced back
and scored in ‘the second and third
quarters.

The Cavaliers controlled the game
and were much better rested than
the Generals who had only an
hour’s rest between the semi-finals
and the finals. The Generals simp-
ly did not have enough energy left
to keep up with the well-rested Cav-
aliers.

Booters Record Now 8-2-1

Washington and Lee finished the
regular season with a record of
8-2-1, the best in the school’s his-
tory. Dave Redmond was named the
outstanding defensive player in the
tournament and Wolfe of Randolph-
Macon the outstanding offensive
player.

 

Dave Redmond, W&L’s candidate
for a fullback spot on the All-Amer-
ica team, was outstanding in this
tourney and as mentioned before,
was noted as the best defensive back.
Tim Henry was also lauded for his
offensive work as this center for-
ward led the Generals in scoring
during the regular season.

The W&L defensive unit played its
usual fine game throughout the tour-
nament with goalie Bob Larus mak-
ing numerous saves. The Generals
leave for Tufts College Noc. 18 to
play in the Eastern division of the

NCAA Playoffs.

Saturday afternoon, Washington
and Lee’s cross-country team con-
tinued to stay in the winner's col-
umn as they defeated Fairmont
College, 19-44.

The Generals took all but second
place out of the first seven. Fresh-
man George Parker took first place
finishing the 4.1 mile course in 24
minutes, 21 seconds.

Harriers Race Highpoint Next

Next Saturday at 2:45, the harriers
close the season with Highpoint Col-
lege. This year’s team has been not
only a tremendous success but also
a great improvement over past teams
at W&L as they finished third in the
state meet.

A particular highlight of the meet!

was the fact that only one minute!
separated the first and seventh men.
Lee Johnson placed third for the}
Generals with a time of 24:33. Andy

for the Washington Senators in which he describes what each of the Nats

it to some members of the Washington and Lee football team.

To the Editor:

 

Having read Friday’s edition of the
Ring-tum Phi, I can see what Barry
Goldwater said about being misquot-
ed. The article containing the story
on combos is one which shows the
misinterpretation that can arise from
telephone canversations.

Thursday night I was contacted by
a columnist and asked to make a state-
ment. What appeared Friday does not
say what I said. The columnist said
that he thought that he had the gist
of what I had to say, I see now that
he did not.

First, all groups here have not been
booked by one agent. Many of them
are, perhaps a majority of them are
handled by one agency. True, many
have complained of the higher prices
of combos, but this complaint comes
from all quarters and is aimed at all
agents and combos. These gripes have
been mounting in the past years, es- |
pecially when the cost of fraternity |
social activities are topic of conver-

 

sation on the Hill or at the individu-
al’s home. As far as the bad service
is concerned, I said that I felt there)

could be changes in procedure. |

At the meeting today, Ted Hall, |
alone, came to represent his agency.
This seemed to indicate that he is |
more interested in social life at W&L
than his competitor: Spotlight Attrac- |
tions. What the above mentioned are |
ticle says about the latter’s selection |
of groups is correct (namely that they
have groups which other agencies do!
not), as is the statement that their
prices are lower. But, Spotlight has
quoted lower prices on which they are
unable to deliver. When confronted
with these prices, they denied them.
Ted Hall stood firm on all prices quot-
ed by himself in the past. This leads
myself as well as other social chair-
men to the opinion that Ted Hall is

amples of past trouble with groups
and told all present how to handle

late combos, drunk ones, combos
which did not bring all their members
and other questions. The fifinal im-
pression which I received was one
which one would have having seen
the past election’s results (with Ted
Hall as Johnson).

The meeting today answered many
questions in different social chairmen’s
minds and put Ted in the fore. Te also
quoted prices for the Dance Board
which are considerably lower than
those paid at present to Stan Rubin in
New York. I shall cite a few examples:
we paid Fats Domino $2100 three years
ago, Ted’s price $1250, we paid Bo
Diddley $1000, as opposed to $650, and
Hank Ballard and the Midnighters
$1500, to $950. These prices are con-
firmed and it seems to me that maybe
the Dance Board could make use of
these prices and save the school mony.

Finally, any doubts that myself or
anyone else may have had about Ted
Hall are gone. He has presented his
case and his opposition has not. He
has made himself a strong new tie
here and I think that the Dance Board
should make use of his service.

Sincerely,

ED ALLEN
IFC Social Chairman

tion of the play. Shylock, for a century the captive of the
sentimentalists, becomes again the vengeful, usurious
Jew of Renaissance report. The real sense of religious
conflict between Jew and Christian, which through sub-
sequent religious indiflerentism has dwindled into egali-
tarian tolerance, comes alive for he audience.

It is historically proper that Shylock be portrayed
as the embodiment of the evil principle, the merciless
and usurious Jew of Renaissance legend, not as a tragic,
persecuted member of a religious minority. If the intol-
erant insist on viewing the play as corroboration of
their own prejudices, they are the poorer for this, not
Shakespeares art. Shylock’s pivotal line, on which
hinges the interpretation of his character, “Hath not a

Paternalistic Discipline

Walk into any classroom on any Saturday morning, find
at least a third of the class not in attendance, and the professor
wondering why he bothered to come, and you will ask yourself
the inevitable: Why should we have Saturday classes?

Saturday classes are marked by a singular lack of applica-
tion or academic curiosity. A lackadaisical attitude prevails,
since neither the students nor the professors themselves wanted
to be there. One is led inevitably to question the value to be
derived from these meetings.

If we did abolish Saturday classes, we would allow an un-
interrupted weekend for study and for necessary trips. We
would avoid the Sunday night study scramble and the Monday
morning dreariness resulting from the hurried weekend. If
we were to abolish Saturday classes, the inescapable result
would be that the professors would have the time necessary to
complete the discussions which they are now just getting into
when the bell rings.

Assuredly, the abolition of Saturday classes would result
in the extension of the weekend from Friday noon to Monday
morning. The responsibility of taking a W&L education ser-
iously would be left up to the student, where it originally should
have been located.

The discipline of having Saturday classes is an example of
the University’s paternalistic attitude and a witness to the lack
of confidence which they feel in the mautrity of the student.
Men, if they are to become mature, must mature by accepting
responsibility themselves, not by having it thrust upon them
by the discipline of Saturday classes.

Those who did not respond positively to this freedom
would in all probability flunk out. Many fine universities, how-
ever, do not have Saturday classes and their student bodies
seem not to have suffered from it. Instead, this freedom seems
to have evoked a greater sense of the individuals’ responsibility
to himself in attaining an education.

We shouldn’t be forced to play the role of the educational
dwarf, led to the classroom on Saturday by a paternalistic
discipline.

Brown has its Pembroke, Harvard

and Washington and Lee “studs”
have their Hollins “honeys”’—or so
they think.

Once upon a time, when to be a
Washington and Lee gentleman re-
quired more than an account with J.
Press and a passport from The High
School, the Washington and Lee
monopoly at Hollins was more than
geographic. The knight of Washing-
ton Hall made their conquests by
brandishing wit, irresistable charm,
and—perish the thought—good form.
The bottle, cars and sexual bravado
were the things of knaves. But alas,
the knights took to the bottle, the
squires to emulating the knights, and
the knaves effeced a court coup.

The neighboring damsels, finding

Assistant Professor, Political Science

Bill Burke repeats the official
Goldwater line when he suggests in
his column of the 13th that Gover-
nor Rockefeller and Ambassador
Lodge could have delivered 2 or 3
Million votes to the GOP. He does
not explain nor support this propo-
sition, and I believe that insofar
as it was meant to apply to the
State of New York it is exceedingly
improbable.

It is much more probable that an
all-out Rockefeller effort for Gold-
water would have further harmed,
rather than helped, the Republican
cause in New York. Certainly such
an effort would have played into
the hands of the Democrats whose
strategy was to link Republican
candidates to “Goldwaterism”
(meaning to most New Yorkers, I be-
lieve, not racism but abandonment
of the tradition of Lincoln, not war-
mongering but flippancy about nu-
clear war, not fascism but the Len-
inist-like tactics of the Birch So-
ciety). In this regard, of course, the
New York situation was probably
not unlike that in other northern
and midwestern states (which if true

Under such circumstances a

by Rockefeller’s advisers, of course,

Fraternity hazing was condemned,

lauded, and one columnist pointed
out that we have a precious legacy

The Ring-tum Phi Presents Albee Original

The Ring-tum Phi recently received a letter and manuscript
from the playwright Edward Albee, author of Who’s Afraid

to help direct the Troubadours in their production of these
latter two plays.

I reflected, once, on my great love for sleep, but it

that I slept so much because of the very fact that I was an

Generals, Washington End Season Here

Winner To Share In CAC Crown;
Generals Seek 4th Straight Win

By JOHNNY GRAHAM
With a shot for the College Athletic Conference football

title riding on the outcome, Washington and Lee’s streaking
Generals take the field tomorrow against the Battling Bears of

Washington University.
A win in the final game of

the season will leave the Gen-

erals in a tie with Sewanee for the CAC title, and give them a.

 

5-4 record for the season and a 3-1*

conference mark. Sewanee has fin-
ished its conference slate with a
3-1 mark, but can do no better than
tie for the title with the winner of
the W&L-Washington game.

Washington carries a 5-3-1 mark
into its final game and is 2-1 in
conference play. The Bears lost
only to Sewanee in the CAC. Gener-
al coach Lee McLaughlin cites this
as “a real tough game.” Washing-
ton has a big forward wall, aver-
aging 210 pounds in the defensive
line, and a bevy of good backs.

With a large squad, the Bears sub-
stitute freely, using a number of
specialists. They have been suc-
cessful in defensing most opponents
although several have scored on
long runs. The Bears held Centre to
11 yards total offense, winning 28-7.

No startling changes are in store
for the WU game, although Coach
Mac indicated that his charges will
probably pass more than they did
last week when they completed four
of eight for 44 yards. The short flat
pass seems to have the best chance
of clicking, although several teams
have connected on the long bomb.

Sewanee had some success last
week running off the weak side
tackle, and the Generals will direct
a large portion of their ground at-
tack here.

Last week's 9-0 win over South-
western pleased the General mentor
in several areas although he stated
that he “didn’t come away from the|
game with any degree of satisfac-
tion.” He was particularly pleased
with the job that the pass defense
did.

With Gordon Gay leading the safe-
ties, and Starke Sydnor leading the
defensive charge, the Generals held
the Lynx to two completions in 20
attmepts for a total of one yard.
McLaughlin also cited Cary Green
for his second successful field goal
in as many games.

Riding a three-game winning
streak, the Generals have a chance
for the CAC championship and a
winning record in a year billed as
“rebuilding.”

Sport Briefs

All those interested in taking part
in track and field are asked to re-
port to a meeting on Monday night,
November 23, at 7:30 in Doremus

ZBT Captures
Football Title

By JOHN BEAGLE

ZBT with a rugged defense and
an almost as sharp offense has won
the 1964 Intramural Football Cham-
pionship. ZBT did with a forfeit win
yesterday afternoon over PiKA.

But the big game was held
Wednesday afternoon between ZBT
and the SPE’s. In that game, ZBT’s
tough defense held SPE’s high scor-
ing football machine scoreless in
chalking up a 14-0 win to all but
clinch the IM championship.

ZBT on Monday has beaten KA,

 

14-6, and SPE had defeated PiKA,!

12-8. In another game, KA won over
PiKA, 14-6, and last week SPE
smashed KA, 44-0.

Final playoff standings in IM foot-
ball: 1. ZBT, 3-0; 2. SPE, 2-1; 3.
KA, 1-2; 4. PiKA, 0-3.

In wrestling, another league champ
has been decided as Phi Kap upset
Sigma Chi, 33-5, and then beat Kap-
pa Sig 20-13 to carry off the honors
in League B. Phi Psi is already in
the finals having taken the League
D championship.

SPE is almost a cinch to make the
finals with only one match left
against NFU in league C. Phi Gam
and ZBT will wrestle for the League
A crown after Thanksgiving.

In the finals pick: 1. Phi Psi, 2

David Described As ‘Free Spirit’

By FRANK PARSONS
(Editor’s note: Frank Parsons,
Director of W&L’s Information
Service, recently sent a letter to
Virginia sportswriters regarding
Bill David. The following article

is derived from that letter.)

There’s a certain free spirit who
plays halfback for Washington and
Lee’s football team. Bill David is his
name, and barring none, he is prob-
ably the best pass receiver ever to
play for W&L, either in the amateur
era or the big time of more than a
decade ago.

He is also one of the most excit-
ing Generals to watch in action, on
and off the playing field.

He drives sports cars, rides a

looking blonde clutching him from
behind), and wears his hair long,
speaks in a husky voice that girls
apparently find irresistable, and can
be (as the mood strikes him) the

or the grubbiest.

As co-captain for 1964, his relaxed
approach to football has at once
perplexed and pleased Coach Lee
McLaughlin.

On the field he gives it all he
has, and this can be considerable.

He is one of the big reasons the
General secondary has given up
only 24 pass completions to 84 op-
ponents’ attempts this year.

As a safety, he has handled 16
punts for an average of only 7.2
yards, but his manner of return has
been spectacular to say the least.
On at least three occasions he has
had long returns of over 30 yards
nullified by clipping penalties. It
seems he jigs around, starts, stops,
relaxes, doubles back, etc. until
(1) he finally gets back to about
where he started (2) he gets a sub-
stantial return and/or (3) one of

 

his frantic teammates, having time
during all this locomotion by David
to throw two or three blocks, will
get called for clipping as the law
of averages and an official catches
up with him. Same thing has hap-
where
David has returned seven for an

pened on kickoff returns

average of 18.6 yards.

David's big talent is catching a
football. He’s done it 41 times this
year for a total of 415 yards, or
better than 10 yards per catch. He’
only scored twice, but many of his
catches have been vital third down
efforts that have sustained many a
W&L drive. McLaughlin rates him
has eve
coached in college or professional
observations. David has the hands,
the moves, and almost the speed

the finest receiver he

necessary to make it in the pros.

Those 41 catches are believed to

be a W&L record. In moving the
publicity office from one place to
another on three occasions during
the past two years, some records

have been temporarily misplaced,
but it’s unlikely that anyone has

topped that mark.

Forty-one receptions is good in
any league, and just about three-
fourths of those catches came against
double and triple-teaming defenses.

I think Bill David is a great one.
It’s a pity that more of the working
press can’t cover the small colleges,
for they've missed a real treat in

this fellow.

Baby Booters Close Season
With 13-1 FUMA Win

Washington and Lee’s freshman
soccer team closed out the 1964
season yesterday afternoon with a
13-1 run-away victory over the
varsity from Fork Union Military
Academy.

Fork Union was handicapped in
the game by the absence of three
starters. W&L kept continuous pres-
sure on the Fork Union goalie. Five
5! W&L booters scored more than one
goal with Al Craig leading the list
with three. Jim Forrester, Jim Kirby,
Ben Johnson, and Bob Logan each
picked up two apiece.
ri} In a game played last Tuesday
afternoon, the W&L freshmen

demy varsity to a 0-0 tie. The AMA

of the rules, turned out to be in
the clear. The rule in question re-
stricted a player to three years of
elegibility in NCAA turney com-
petition only.

Coach Joe Lyles also expressed
pleasure over the relatively light
casualty list. All squad members
were expected to be able to play,
with only three men hampered by
injuries. These were hopeful All-
American fullback Dave Redmond,
forward Dave Kirkpatrick, and half-
back Fred Skinner.

Kirkpatrick, who reinjured his
separated shoulder in VISA tourna-
ment finals, appeared in good con-
dition, but the shoulder remained
a question mark. Redmond was
troubled by his recurring bruised
hip, while Skinner suffered from a
pulled muscle.

The Generals missed winning last
week’s state meet due to a new rule
which took effect only this year.
Under VISA rules if the score is
still tied after a double overtime
period a tournament game is award-
ed to the team gaining the greatest
number of corner kicks. This rule
formerly included only corner kicks
in the overtime period itself; and
under this rule Virginia had beaten
Lynchburg for the title two years in
a row.

Before this year’s tournament,
however ,the coaches had voted to
count corner kicks scored in the
whole game. And in the finals, UVa.
(which had beaten Lynchburg in the
semifinals by scoring the first cor-
ner kick in sudden death after
both goals and corner kicks were
tied) took the title away from W&L,
outdoing them 7-4 in corners de-
spite the Generals’ 2-1 advantage
in the overtime period .

Column Results Negative

But, curiously enough, nothing
happened.

Feddemann is still here, and so
is conventional dress; the fraternities
still have rallies, and conformity
doesn’t seem to have disappeared

Not even the columnists have
changed. They're still trying, still |
avidly pursuing the course of the
gadfly. And we still believe in
ourselves, and know in our hearts
that we are really right.

The whole thing is kind of ridicu-
lous, isn’t it?

I guess it’s worth it, though. After
all, it’s satisfying to know Bob Payne

Hawkins Sees Pre-Election Polls
Indicating Goldwater Undertow

gree to which Goldwater would be
a drag in New York State.

I submit that virtually every pre-
election indicator in New York (lo-
cal polls, professional politicians,
etc.) pointed to a gigantic Goldwater
undertow. Political imperatives, in
other words, necessitated a shun-
Goldwater stategy. The results speak
for themselves, not only in New
York but also in states like Iowa
and Indiana where there was no
problem with feet-dragging liberals.

 

One strategy and one strategy alone
would have prevented the great
Goldwater undertow, i.e., the nomi-|
nation of someone else to head the
ticket. That Goldwater strategists |
were persuaded to the contrary is
merely a significant comment on the
caliber of the strategists.

apparently believed that the evi-
dence pointed to a good showing
by the leading conservative, pos-
sibly even a victory. This would
explain the Senator’s statement,
made while announcing his candi-
dacy, that he would not hourt the
conservative cause if he got forty-
five per cent of the vote.

What were the major assumptions
on which Senator Goldwater’s can-
didacy was based, and how realistic
were they in terms of existing
knowledge about American politics?
Any answer to such questions, of
course, is liable to the objection
that this or that was not in fact
a major assumption etc. However, I
believe that the following “assump-
tions” represent the views of many
if not most reputable academic and
journalistic observers. (What pro-
portion of either group is sensation-
seeking I am unable to say.) Futher-
more it is doubtful that in the ab-
sence of such assumptions Gold-
water’s candidacy would have made
sense at all.

The basic strategic assumptions
(there were also important tactical
assumptions made during the actual
campaign) were (1) that the South
was Goldwater territory (2) that the
backlash among “ethnic minorities”
in the big cities would substantially
reduce or even overcome the tra-
ditional Democratic advantage in
those key places (3) that a con-
servative candidate would bring out
the non-voter, allegedly a conserva-
tive, who was sulking over his lack
of a real choice and (4) that a con-
servative candidate could retain the
great bulk of registered Republicans
as well as the firm support of the
so-called Presidential Republicans
(i.e., the “liberals” or “moderates”).
| It will be the burden of this essay
to show that these assumptions were
extravagant and improbable, with the
exception of number 4, and that the
people making them showed no very
profound regard for the conse-

quences of the sort of debacle that
materialized.

The new W&L chapter of Circle
K, international college service club,
met last night to organize commit-
tees and plan of relection of offi-
cers.

Cirele K was started at W&L last
spring when a small group of stu-
dents met to discuss the possibility
of a club forming this year. The
group, headed by Jody Luck and
Dave Shuffelbarger, contacted the
Lexington Kiwanis Club for help.
Wiwanis is the parent organization
for Circle K.

As a result, the Kiwanis Club
vote dto send Shuffflelbarger and
Luck to the International K Con-
vention in Chicago. On their return,
they made a report to the Lexington
Kiwanis Club. This year, on No-
vember 4 an organizational meeting
took place and the machinery was
set in motion to work toward a per-
manent organization.

At the first organizational meet-
inf, the Governor of the Capital Dis-
trict of Circle K Clubs, Graham Per-
kins, and one of his Lt. Governors,
James Wyatt, were present and ex-
plained to the students assembled

E.C. Sets Date of Dress Referendum,
Rejects Proposal for Election Reform

 

 

Junior Class

Poll Reflects

Opinion on Dress, Committee

By STEVE SAUNDERS

Results of a poll on conventional
dress taken among members of the
Junior class at the beginning of
the semester by Junior E.C. repre-
sentative Fred Mindel were released
today. Sixty per cent of the class
filled out the questionnaire. Results
indicated definite approval of con-
ventional dress, but wide-spread dis-
enchantment with the Assimilation
Committee as presently constituted.

Three Questions

The questions posed in the Mindel
poll were similar to those which will
appear on the December referen-
dum ballot. They were: 1.) “Do you
favor conventional dress?”; 2.) “Do
you think an Assimilation Commit-
tee is necessary to uphold this tra-
dition?”; and, 3.) “Do you favor the
Assimilation Committee as it pres-
ently exists?” Ninety-one per cent
of those possed answered affirma-
tively to the first question. Fifty-
eight per cent of those polled said
“yes” to the second. However, only
twenty-seven per cent answered af-
firmatively to the last question, re-
lating to the Assimilation Commit-
tee as it now stands.

Mindel’s Purpose
According to Mindel, “...the pur-
pose of this questionnaire was to

| class on some the major issues con-

fronting the Student Body.” When
asked for comment on the results,
Mindel replied, “I believe the school-
wide referendum will show these
same results; that the large majori-
ty of students find themselves com-
patible with the principle but not
the enforcement of conventional
dress. Their objections and criticisms
stem from the enforcement of the
principle by the Assimilation Com-
mittee.”
Requests Suggestions

A fourth question posed by Min-
del in his Junior class questionnaire
was: “What improvements would
you suggest?” Most of those who
took part in the poll suggested im-
provements dealing with liberal-
izing present enforcement.

Ideas mentioned most frequently
were: permitting wheat jeans and
sweaters with tie as acceptable con-
ventional dress; removing restric-
tions on Saturdays, Sundays, and
after dark; and on stressing a general
neat appearance rather than specific
attire.

Also repeatedly expressed was the
wish to see a more definite Assimi-
lation Committee policy. Indicated as
well was a feling that the Assimila-
tion Committee should be more rep-
resentative of the Student Body and

 

reveal more accurately for me the

prevalent ideas and opinions of mytive Committee.

December 9 was set as the date for a student body refer-
endum on conventional dress and the Assimilation Committee,
as the Executive Committee acted last night on a petition to
bring the enforced tradition of coats and ties to an opinion
vote. The EC also selected the wording of the four choices
which will be offered students on the ballots in the referendum.

“Mark One Only”

Each student will be able to vote
for only one choice in the referen-
dum, which cannot concreately af-
fect the present traditions or its
administration, since to do so would
require a constitutional amendment.

The referendum will be held in
Washington Hall, from 8:15 a.m.
till 2:00 p.m. on December 9. The
results, said student body president
Jim Kulp, will be made available
to the Ring-tum Phi before Christ-
mas vacation.

Last night's action by the EC
was the result of a petition insti-
gated by a small group of students,
the spokesman for whom has been
Sigma Chi Warren Montgomery. The
EC had requested the opinion of the
Assimilation Committee before
it acted on the petition, and Assim-
ilation Committee chairman Brooks
Brown appeared before the EC last
week.

Freshmen Appointed

Freshmen appointed to serve on
student body committees were
Chuck Fatzinger, the Library Com-
mittee; and Emory Waters, the Cold
Check Committee. In selection of
the freshman representative on the
Assimilation Committee, the BC vot-
ed to have personal interviews with
five freshmen next week.

The five picked for interviews
are Dave Dougherty, Steve Shep-
herd, Luke Crosland, Jody Kline,
and Harold Stowe. These men
were all “strongly recommended”
by a subcommittee which went
over all applications before the

Huxley’s Literature and Science will
be reviewed by Sid Parham.

The issue will be put on sale in
the student co-op and in local book-

 

 

stores, but Ledbetter said that sub-
scriptions are still available. Led-
better and junior Grayson Powell are
co-editors of the magazine, which
is in only its third year of existence.

Ledbetter said that the magazine

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Why Not Gracefully?

The Ring-tum Phi prints today a letter to the editor
which is good evidence of the probability that some peo-
ple will never be able to adapt themselves to some of the
changes which have occurred in the last few years. The
author of the letter shows his littleness by refusing to
capitalize the word “Negro,” which is capitalized by Noah
Webster, among others; this man’s attack is not serious.
There is, however, a somewhat more serious attack tak-
ing shape on campus in the form of a student petition
which protests the Board of Trustees’ recent announce-
ment that there will be no racial discrimination in W&L
admissions policy.

The extent of the petition’s circulation, and the suc-
cess it is having, are unknown because the thing is evident-
ly an underground movement so far. Perhaps the origina-
tors of the petition are ashamed to have their identities
known at large. At any rate, underground movement is
what can be expected of the kind of people who are fight-
ing integration. These are people who have gone into hid-
ing from the vast majority of Americans, and indeed from
the twentieth century. These are people who must go un-
derground to save themselves from reality. These are
people who have failed to present a single effective argu-
ment for inflicting their prejudices on the rest of us;
their only weapons are those which force them under-
ground.

The Board’s announcement of non-discrimination
was made because Washington and Lee could no longer
hold its head up as a leading educational institution until
it removed itself from the suspicion of prejudice. The
announcement did no more than affirm the simple old be-
lief that all men are entitled to equal dignity, regardless
of the color of their skin. The question is no longer wheth-
er to integrate or stagnate—that has been decided—the
question is whether Washington and Lee can integrate
gracefully.

The students responsible for the present petition
may be able to create a regrettably awkward situation;
this is the most they could accomplish. It is inconceivable
that the faculty, which has long waited for integration
and which now has been given control over admissions,
would reverse its present course. We urge students to
listen to the plea of Jim Kulp, president of the student
body, and to continue to support the university in its
policies. We urge that the decision be accepted gracefully.
Last year’s student body president, Bill Noell, gave the
same advice—on the same subject—many times, as did
the only class representative to the EC to speak at
last month’s leadership forum. Only the men who are car-
ride along blindly by their own prejudices—or by those
of their parents or friends—can disregard this respon-
sibility to the school; in doing so they will also be disre-
garding a responsibility to themselves.

 

 

Hardening of the Arteries

The decline of Washington and Lee’s only prestigious
student discussion group is a sorry sight. The Liberty Hall
Society, once a serious and productive organization, has
fallen into such disrepair that perhaps it no longer ever
lives up to its name of an ‘intellectual discussion” society.
The specific reasons for the failure of Liberty Hall are not
for us to know, since the society is semi-secret; but the
root of the trouble seems to be what must be Washington
and Lee’s biggest trouble: intellectual apathy. “Apathy”
is a notorious cry, it is true; but if Liberty Hall can attract
only five or six “intellectuals” to its meetings, perhaps
student inertness has really reached a new peak.

Perhaps it is time to take a point from Sylvia Doughty,
the Hollins editor who last week condemned Washington
and Lee men for their “adolescent preoccupations.” Time
for Washington and Lee to reconsider the fact that if a
man does not give his time to intellectual pursuits while
he is in college—he is unlikely ever to be affliated with
these pursuits. Time for the fraternity system to take a
look at the effect it has on the college career. Time for
somebody to realize that, whether the accusation of
“apathy” is parochial or not, it is accurate.

The ailing Liberty Hall Society is not the only evi-
dence of this. Nineteen sixty-four was an election year,
but the presidential campaign made literally no impres-
sion on this student body. Lectures and concerts go poorly
attended. Neither student nor university sponsored liter-
ary magazines get much student support. In fact, the
only thing which has aroused prolonged student activity
here in the last few years is the Conservative Society and
its newspaper, the Southern Conservative.

It is possible that the “Contact” organization will pro-
duce a discussion weekend which will overcome indif-
ference, Or that Ariel will become a vehicle for intellectual
expression. Perhaps the Liberty Hall Society can be over-
hauled and regain the stature it had when it undertook
such projects as the examination of the college’s curri-
cula. The new “Circle K"’ club may become an active serv-
ice club and involve more students in outside activities.
Maybe some professors will break through the barrier to
intellectual enthusiasm. But if so, it would be a very
noticeable change.

This has been a bad year for
movies. At least in Lexington.
Whether to blame it on the local
empresarios, on the distribution
procedures which handicap them, or
on the actual products of recent
industry and individual efforts, I
don’t know. But the regrettable and
expensive fact persists that movies
are worse than ever: regrettable for
obvious reasons; expensive because
people, well, students, continue pay-
ing to see films of mediocre quality,
if only for want of something else
to do.

All of which is not to say that
there has not been occasional re-
spite from the dull pattern spun
by such regulars as Anthony Quinn,
Henry Fonda (D-N.Y.) Stefanie
Powers (she surfs), and Shelly
Winters. For a few enjoyable films
have appeared: Billy Liar, The Five
Day Lover, A Hard Day’s Night,
Viridiana, and, surprisingly, Topkapi.
Billy Liar triumphed because of the
essential appeal of its title character
—or, perhaps more accurately be-
cause of the ease with which one
could identify with his situation. The
Five Day Lover was interesting for
its Flamboyance, instances of which
were incorporated by Truffaut in
Jules and Jim.

Phillipe de Broca, who made The
Five Day Lover in 1960, is a director
worth watching, as his That Man
from Rio (1964) will verify—though
Andrew Sarris, a bad American
critic writing for a bad American
mwspaper, calls de Broca a bad

"Viridiana’”’ Best So Far

 
 

 

Rives Calls 1964 Bad Year
For Flics; Picks Top Five

By Robert Mac Rives

French director making bad Amr-
ican movies. Weismuller has voiced
the same criticism.

To continue, however: A Hard
Day’s Night—the Beatles are uni-
maginative in their rebellion, man-
ufactured or no, against society; they
really don’t have long hair; they
can’t sing; they’re queer, ete. But
A Hard Day’s Night is probably one
of the best and certainly one of
the most outstanding movies of the
year.

Viridiana is the one singularly out-
standing film to have played at the
Lyric or State since September. It
is not a profound movie; deliberate
though he is Bunuel plods mainly
on the surface. But it is an almost
perfectly structured one. That is a
very general assertion, and I hardly
have space here to support it. Yet
granting me that the framework of
Viridiana is so precisely ordered, one
still, I must acknowldge, is justified
in quibbling with its content. Subtle-
ty is not a Bunuel trademark; and
he might have done well to have
ommitted some of the more blatantly
symbolic elements of Viridiana.

Finally, Topkapi, despite excess-
es of acting by Peter Ustinov and
Melina Mercouri and of direction
by Jules Dassin, emerges a divert-
ing picture. Topkapi is supposedly
the light version of Dassin’s Rififi;
and though some would argue that
the latter itself was rather comic
in effect, Dassin’s success in render-
ing Topkapi amusing is considerable
and, this time, intentional.

The five films mentioned above
represent the best that has been of-
fered Washington and Lee movie-
goers this fall. Undoubtedly there
are those who would disagree with
me, but not seriously—for the level
of the movies given us hasn’t beeen
sufficiently high to provoke much
interest, still less debate.

The problem of screening poor
films is not a new one at the State.
Tied to chiefly domestic production,
the State management has small op-
portunity to show more than a
minimal number of premium fea-
tures. The Lyric, on the other hand,
with more leeway in contracting,
has heretofore been able to present
a more varied and stimulating fare.
Such, however, has not quite been
the case lately.

It isn’t that the movies at the
Lyric have been so bad; it’s rather
that they’ve been average—a ques-
tionable adjective to use when
speaking of what is purportedly art,
but which nonetheless seems to ap-
ply here. “In between” is what I
mean to cannote: not good, not bad,
just there.

Movies such as The Seven Sa-
murai, the Chaplin masterpieces, the
Hindu Trrilogy of Ray, the Magician
and even The African Queen are
available. Maybe, of course, there
isn’t much demand for them; but
I for one would like to see them
replace the neutrality of, say, The
Four Days of Naples and Phaedra
(coming).

 

Ed Walker, The Man Behind the Scenes

 

The Real Boss in the

By EAGLE SCOUT DEAN

The Sphinx now asks a new ques-
tion: “Who can beat Hobby Mor-
rison at pool, set the fastest head-
line around, break the biggest gamb-
ling join in Reno, and lead the
Rockbridge Boy Scouts to victory?”
There is only one man around that
I know could begin to liv up to all
these noble attributes, and that is
naturally Edwin T. Walker, Jr.—
“Prince of the Print Shop.” By now
you probably know I'm talking
about “Ed.” You see, many people
never get to know Ed really well
unless they work in the print shop,
play a superior game of pool, or are
a Boy Scout. I'm in th Scouts, so
that’s how I know.

The first time I saw Ed was as
an innocent little freshman who had
to turn in my first story at the
print shop. Well, I walked in a
little nervously, and all of a sudden
this great big guy pops up from
behind the stove and says in a
gruff voice, “Well, what do you
want?” From the tone of his voice

I could tell he meant business but
I just couldn’t get anything out
quickly. And, then before I knew
what was up, I had lost my Scout
dues for the next two months. I
couldn’t figure out how I had lost
so much, but I was to get used to it
in the years to come. You see, Ed
runs the notorious BBB (Better Bet-
ting Bureau).

One thing about Ed, he never
loses an argument. Usually you
never get to second base arguing
with him, but if you really have a
good point and Ed is hard pressed,
he resorts to his famous “argument
crusher”: “Well can you whip me?”

Print Shop

The funny thing is, Ed’s usually
right.

There is a story (though I don’t
believe it) that there was once an
editor who could put Ed down. No,
it wasn't Steve Smith—his name was
Lanny Butler or something like that.
One version goes that Lanny took
up Ed's challenge one day and pin-
ned him. Naturally Ed protested that
Lanny was out of his 137 weight
class. The other version has it that
Lanny and his whole staff took on
Ed with the help of a few lead print
bars and got the best of him. That
was the first time the Ring-tum Phi
did not come out on time. Once I
asked Ed about Lanny and he simply
replied, “Who's he?”

MAMA Sends Help to Lexington:
Sponsors Petition to Save University

By ADDISON BROKENBOW

She was the first little old lady in
tennis shoes I had seen on the W&L
campus, so naturally I stopped. “Ex-
cuse me, madam, are you looking for
your date?”

“No indeed,” she says. “I've come
all the way from Nashville to visit
your beautiful campus as a represen-
tative of the Mothers for a Moral
America, I have a son about your
age myself, you know. Does your
MAMA know you never cut your
hair?”

“Well, ma’m, that's
style in these parts.

“Well, and I guess it's also the
style to vote a gangster and a tool
of the Communist Conspiracy into
the White House, and I guess it's
also the style to write columns de-
fending hideous perversions. Have
you read this book,boy?” The right
tennis shoe kicked me in the shin.

“Well, ma'm, that’s sort of the
I have it, all right.”

“Right! That's right! The leftist
conspiracy is creeping more and
more boldly into power. Do you
know that 48 per cent of college
presidents have been proven to be
socialist orientated? And that's why
I'm here, you know.”

“Oh, you're here to check out our
administration, eh? I understand that
several members of the faculty have
traveled to Russia at one time or
another.”

“Yes, I'm keeping an eye out for
that, too, but that's not exactly why

the sort of

I'm here. MAMA is watching you
young men all the time, you know.
And we think there is something sin-
ister going on here which you may
not even realize. Here, read this
petition.”

I read the petition, which had dot-
ed lines on the right side only. The
petition was for the condemnation of
any moves to dilute the character
and quality of the student body of
the university. It had already been
signed by scores of students. MAMA
had evidenly not rested from its mis-
sion.

You sign that petition, boy, and
you'll be helping to save your school
from the hideous perversions which
the Liberal Conspiracy has inflicted
on all the other schools in the coun-
try. Yes, this may be the only school
which we can save from prog—radi-
cal changes. Thank goodness, there
is still Washington and Lee carry-
ing on the grand traditions of
Jefferson Dav—I mean George
Washington.

“And after you sign this, boy, you
go back to your apartment—you're
not one of those radical perverts
who live in the dorms, are you—and
write a letter to your congressman.
Tell him how you feel and tell him
about the uphill crusade which
MAMA is waging. Understand?” She
got me in the shin again.

“Yes, ma'am, and while you're
here why don’t you go by and see
Coach Lord. He needs a little old

lady like you in the middle dist-
ance.”

“Don't be a smart-alec, young man.
Now you just take one of these pe-
titions, and you get all your friends
to sign. I understand the Mongolian
Finks are a strong right-wing group.
You get the Mongolian Finks to sign
up, every one. How would you like
to have one of those radicals date
your sister, eh? Think about THAT

“And be careful. You never know
what those extremist are going to
try next.”

“Yes ma'am.” I had to agree with
that.

“What can we do?” I asked an-
xiously.

“The petition! Start with the pe-
tition! MAMA loves you young men.
The Daughters of the Confederacy—
that’s one of our parent organiza-
tions—endorses this petition fully.
Also the Children of the Confeder-
acy.

“And—this is strictly confidential—
the Knights of the White Camelia
are 100 per cent behind this! They
consider our petition fully as im-
portant as the petition to reverse
the decision of the Scopes Trial.”

I snapped to attention. “My great-
grandfather was a Knight of the
White Camelia! If the Knights are
behind it it can't be wrong.” I
headed up to the Paramount to find
some membres of the Mongolian
Twinks. I mean Finks. 1 knew they'd
sign.

   

    

Letters

Editor...

Student Says Hollins Girls
Ask For It: Stud Image Is
Demanded By Party Girls

To the Editor:
Dear Miss Doughty,

Surprise! We knew it all along,
Yes, we realize that we conform to
the image. We realize that we are
knaves.

What we never suspected was that
you Hollins girls might be so dif-
ferent. If, as you say, “fewer upper-
classmen at Hollins are exemplifying
the aimless party-girl mystique,”
then the ones who are left must be
intensifying their activities

As you say, the sensitive and in-
telligent young man who enters
Washington and Lee (without excep-
tion) is soon overwhelmed and re-
molded into the stud image. How-
ever, let me point out that one of
the main forces in this process is
the opinion of the girls the sensitive
and intelligent young man meets. It
is the girls who demand the stud
image. They get it.

If a Hollins girl had a date with
one of the sensitive and intelligent
young men you mention, you know
what she’d do. Sure. She’d dump
all over him. She would make her
“inordinate availability” available to
the biggest stud she could find.

Because Hollins girls are really
cool. Just like all the other girls
from all the other women’s colleges
around here. Cool, just like all the
men from all the men’s schools.

But, nevertheless, Miss Doughty, I
see a ray of hope for all you Hol-
lins girls who “are demanding a
wholesome and creative way of life.”
Me. Yes, me. Actually I'm probably
the only guy at W&L who has not
been overwhelmed by the fraternity
system and the stud image. I never
had a chance with the stud image.
So I'm still sensitive and intelligent.

Why don’t you send me the names
of some of these girls who have “re-
treated to more genuinely satisfying
pursuits.” Because so have I. And
maybe we could do our homework
together or something.

Alumnus says Integration
At W@L Insane; Disagrees
With Statement By Kulp

To the Editor:

I am opposed to negro integra-
tion at W&L. “Civil Rights” do not
include having a negro in the next
bunk at Freshman Camp, in the next
room in the dormitory, in th next
chair at the Freshman Dining Hall,
or having the next dance with my
date at a dance.

W&L is a private institution. No-
body is told to buy the “product” by
advertising or selling. It is imprac-
tical, insane and ridiculous to have
one or a few negroes in a student
body as tightly knit as W&L’s.

I object to the following statement
attributed to Jim Kulp, Student
Body President, quoted from the
Oct. 30 Ring-tum Phi:

“In reference to the integration
statement, he (Kulp) stated that
the students must aid in the imple-
mentation of the integration pol-
icy, no matter what the individual's
personal feeling were.”

This is still a free country and
any student who does not believe in
integration DOES NOT HAVE TO
AID IN THE IMPLEMENTATION
OF THIS INTEGRATION.

Wigert Replies to “Lamb”
Column; Betas Refuse
Cassius Clay Award

To the Editer:

In response to the witless attacks
of an article “Lamchopped Awards”
in the Tuesday edition of the Ring-
tum Phi, the Beta house would like
to state at this time its sincere be-
lief that the article was not written
by Lamar Lamb but was actually
intended as a clever and vicious as-
sault on his intelligence and in-
tegrity .

By writing something that would
obviously be accepted as the work
of a petty fool and then attributing
it to the unfortunate Lamb, the real
author has undoubtedly attempted
to slander Lamar more maliciously
than his piece has slandered certain
institulions and personalities of our
University.

Therefore, for the bitier and ap-
parently unmotivated slash at our
fraternity, the Betas hold to blame
not Lamar but the small-minded
individual who signed Lamar’s namy

64 Soccer Team

Finishes Second In Country

 

 

 

Kickers Lose)
NCAA Title

By TOM CARPENTER
Tuesday Sports Writer

The Washington and Lee
soccer team is now officially
the second best college soccer
team in the United States, The
national soccer association di-

vides the good soccer teams in- |
to two classifications, universities
and colleges. Washington and Lee
is considered a college for these
tournaments because of its size.

Four teams were chosen for the
tournament, the choosing being done

Generals Lose to WU, 16-14

After holding onto a slim 14-13 lead throughout the second
half, Saturday, Washington and Lee fell victim to a long fourth
quarter Washington University pass and ensuing field goal
with 15 seconds left to lose the game, 16-14, and the CAC
championship.

The Battling Bears from St. Louis came into this contest
with a 5-3-1 record, while tie Gon ————

as Tri-Captains for next season. Two
Delts, Billy Andrews and Joe Miller,
and a KA, Jeff Novinger, will lead
the Generals.

Andrews, a scatback from Roa-

defensively this year in his safety
position. From Nashville, Tennessee,

a vote, the proposal will be prepared
as a constitutional amendment.

Nation’s plan provides for a free
system of primaries which would re-
move political control from any party
organization and place the elections
completely in the hands of the stu-
dent body as a whole.

Nation himself has stated that he
is not as much concerned with the

IFC Columnist

After a week’s absence from con-
troversial “columnizing’—I _ slept
through last week’s meeting—it’s
time again to review the significant
and and sometimes not  ossignifi-
cant, events of the IFC

First a note to students interested
in participating. Yes, there is an
opportunity to participate in IFC
sponsored activities. You may ex-
press your praise, concern, or criti-
cism through your IFC member.

These committee represent a
cross-section of activity. The Social
Committee is headed by Ed Allen;
Chuck Griffin is chairman of the
popular Bus Committee. Roger Mi-
lam is head of the Charity Commit-
tee. Blaine Brownell is chairman of
Contact. Geoff Butler is chairman of
Town Relations Committee. And
Brooks Brown and Paton Adams
are chairmen of Financial and Con-
stitutional Committees respectively.

If you have an idea, why not ex-
press it to one of these committee
chairmen. No doubt they will appre-
ciate your interest. For example,
last night members discussed the
possibility for sponsoring an IFC
float in the Lexington Christmas

IFC Names Committee Chairmen

Parade. If you have an idea, or
wish to help in construction, con-
tact Geoff Butler, town relation
chairman.

For all those students and even
faculty members who find Lexington
a last outpost for cultural exper-
ience, the IFC has established an
intercollegiate calendar, which can
be found on the IFC bulletin board
in the student union. The calendar
wil lannounce coming events in the
cultural, social, and athletic realms
on such campuses as W&L, UVa.,
Randolph-Macon, Hollins, Sweet
Briar, and Mary Baldwin.

Those fraternities remaining with
outstanding financial statements are
as follows: Delta Tau Delta; Delta
Upsilon; Kappa Alpha; Kappa Sig-
ma; Phi Kappa Psi; Phi Kappa Sig-
Ma; Sigma Nu; Phi Epsilon Pi; Pi
Kappa Alpha; and Sigma Alpha
Epsilon.

ODK Taps Sixteen On Fiftieth Anniversary

By BILLY CANNON
News Editor

The national leadership fraternity,
Omicron Delta Kappa, today tapped
thirteen students and five alumni at
its 50th Anniversary “tap day” as-
sembly.

The national honorary fraternity
which was founded at Washington
and Lee in 1914 selected 5 seniors,
3 juniors, and 5 law students at the
noon-hour assembly. Presiding at
the convocation was Steve Smith,
president of the W&L chapter of
ODK.

Membership in ODK is extended
only to those students who rank in
the upper 35 per cent of their class
and who have made significant con-
tributions in the fields of scholar-
ship, athletics, publications, social
and religious affairs, speech, music
and dramatic arts.

Dr. Samuel R. Spencer, Jr., pres-
ident of Mary Baldwin College, ad-
dressed the assembly (see related
story). President Spencer also
figured in another anniversary of
ODK event at Washington and Lee.
When the society observed its 25th
birthday, he was among those initi-
ated into membership in ceremonies

 

held in the university’s Lee Chapel.

Friday
Edition

Last April, the national Golden
Anniversary convention of ODK
made a special one-day pilgrimage
to Lexington for special ceremonies
commemorating the founding of the
society which now has chapters on
111 American campuses.

Professor Rupert N. Latture, pro-
fessor emeritus of political science,
is one of six surviving men who were
among the 15 who founded ODK
at W&L. He participated in the an-
niversary assembly. Another of the
original founders of the orgam.’.i-
tion, Dr. James E. Bear of Union
Theological Seminary, was also on
hand for the ceremony.

An unusually large number of
alumni were tapped. Smith ex-
plained that it was done in honor
of the 50th Anniversary of ODK.
The alumni included James Som-
erville, James C. Ambler, John
M. Stemmons, Major General
Archibald A. Sprowl and S. L.
Kopald, Jr.

Among the seniors tapped for the
honor were Stephen Todd Hibbard,
Loyle Shannon Jung, Forrest Lamar
Lamb, Larry Maurice Meeks, and
Jon Allen Supak. The junior honor-
ed included David Nicholas Mar-
chese, Frederick Myers Mindel, and

 

Charles Ganal Walker, III. The four
law students were Jimmy Delp
Bowie, Frank Eugene Brown, Rob-
ert Theodore Mitchell, Jr., and Rob-
bert Stephen Pless.

In one of the real surprises of
the ceremony, potential initiate La-
mar Lamb declined to the “tap”
saying, “Steve, I appreciate the hon-
or, but I cannot accept the tap.”
Lamb gave no reason for his refusal.

Somerville, Class of 1912, received
both an A.B. and a M.A. from
W&L. While a student here he was
editor of the Ring-tum Phi and was
elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Mr.
Somerville resides in Washington,
D.C.

Ambler, Class of 1918, is from
Montclair, New Jersey. He has serv-
ed as superintendent of schools in
Fauquier County and is now Chair-
man of the Board of Directors of
Ginn and Company, publishers of
educational books. Mr. Ambler has
been one of the University’s most
loyal and most generous supporters.

Stemmons, Class of 1931, is from
Dallas. He is president of the In-
dustrial Properties Corporation, and
is head of the important Dallas
Citizens Council. With his brother,

 

Storey, Mr. Stemmons is promoter

of the Trinity Industrial District, the
Trinity Navigation Project, Stemm-
mons Towers, and the Stemmons
Expressway.

Sprowl, Class of 1937, is from
Staunton, where he is vice president
of the W. J. Perry Corporation and
president of the Perry-Sprowl Cor-
poration, a mortgage investment
company. General Sprowl was dec-
orated for distinguished service as
a combat officer in World War II
and is now commander o fthe 29th
Infantry Division of the National
Guard.

Kopland, Class of 1943, is from
Memphis, Tennessee. He is a vice
president of Humko Company and
has the position of president of the
Rotary Club, Chairman of the Com-
munity Chest Campaign, vice pres-
ident of the Chamber of Commerce,
and a director of the Federal Re-
serve Bank.

Seniors

Hibbard, a Phi Kap from Pittsfield,
Mass., is the president of both the
IFC and the Dance Board. He is
also the president of his fraternity.
During last year’s Mock Convention
Hibbard headed the Rockefeller
campaign.

Fitzroy MacleanCompares
Past and Modern Russia

By WARREN MONTGOMERY

Thursday night in Lee Chapel,
Brigadier Sir Fitzroy Maclean,
British Conservative Member of
Parliament, addressed a large audi-
ence on “Russia Yesterday and To-
day.” Sir Maclean, who is on a
speaking tour of the United States,
was invited here by Dr. Milton Col-
vin of the Political Science Depart-
ment.

In his hour-long speech and dis-
cussion, Brigadier Maclean compared
conditions in Stalinist Russia with

those of today and discused the
West's best approach to Soviet
Communism.

Sir Maclean was with the British
embassy in Moscow during the
purges of of 1937 which sent one-half
of the poliburo and general staff to
the wall. In 1937, Russia was under-
going “a reign of terror unequalled
in the whole bloodstained history of
Russia,” Maclean remarked. The
Russian people were terrified and
suspicious of everyone from for-
eigners to members of their fam-
ilies.

Fatal Date

Contact with foreigners especiai-
ly was “the kiss of death.” Illus-
traiting his point, Sir Maslean told

of his experience in once dating a_

Russian girl. That same night she
was dragged away from her home
by the secret police, never to be
seen again.

Sir Maclean then described his re-

Russia is still totalitarian, but less |
obviously so. Though it is still “hard- |
er to buy a toothbrush than a grand}

ingly available. A permanent aristo-|
cratie ruling class has flourished, |
unlike in Sialin’s time when the|
governmental classes were first on|
the liquidation list. In general,|
standard of living and overall h yp-|
piness have immensely increased
since Stalin's death.

Increased Freedom from Fear

The Russian metamorphosis can
be explained, said Sir Maclean, by
a change in attitude of the govern-
ment. “Stalin learned only late in
his life that if you shoot all the
people all the time, they soon stop
really caring.” Khrushchev saw that!
maximum effort could not be achiev-
ed unless the people had some sem-
blanee of civil rights. He consequent- |

mented Sir Maclean.

Spencer Delivers Address;
Says Leader Must Be Critic

Earlier this afternoon in

Doremus Gymnasium, Presi-

dent Samuel R. Spencer of Mary Baldwin College addressed
the 50th anniversary “tap day” assembly of Omicron Delta

Kappa.

The theme of Dr. Spencer's address was “The Campus

Implications

Of Referendum

By BROOKS BROWN
Chairman

With the referendum on traditional
dress scheduled for next Wednes-
day, Brooks Brown, Chairman of
the Assimilation Committee, revealed
that everything was set to hold the
referendum.

Looks Forward

Brown said this week that he and
and the members of the committee
looked forwatd to next Wednesday.
“We welcome the opportunity to

on dress and the committee,” said
Brown. “This is the first time that
sich a referendum has been held
so far as I know, and it represents
the best way for the committee to
find out exactly what students want
our standards to be.”

Study of Results

The results of the referendum will
be studied by the Assimilation Com-

tion rules reflect the opinion of the
student body as a whole. Brown said

realize that this was their chance
to speak for any changes they
wanted made. He further stated that
one of the main purposes of the
referendum was to prove to the
students that the Assimilation Com-
mittee wants to represent the cam-
pus as a whole and not just the
members of the commitice

Fears Lack of Thought

One of the major fears of the
committee apparently is that many
students will vote without thinking
Brown stressed the need for respon-
sible thought by each student before
his vote is cast

“Our that students will
vote against the committee or good
dress standards without really con-
sidering the implications involved.”
Chairman Brown said that he was
convinced that a vote for the aboli-
tion of the Assimilation Committee
was as good a vote to abolish tradi-
tional dress

*campus leader must, at the e-me time

he is a scholar and as a prerequisite
of being a politican, also be a campus
critic. .. . The ultimate object of so-
cial criticism is constructive change.
Before he can effect constructive
change, the campus leader must
first be able to analyze intelligent-
ly and discriminate between what
needs to be changed and what does
not.”

“The liberal studies which engage
us in our primary function as schol-
ars make critics of us all,” continued
Dr. Spencer. “It might even be
claimed that if liberal education is
doing its job, the degree of criticism
and unrest on a college campus is
a measure of the curriculum’s effec-
tiveness.”

“But the same liberal education
which informs its disciples with a
penchant and a capacity for criti-
cism must ... also give the critic an
awareness of the fact that he does
not act in vacuo, but rather in an
established framework of temporal,
spatial, and human relationships.”

Dr. Spencer went on to describe
the pitfalls open to a campus critic,
stating that “...the campus critic
must be, though it is often unexcit-
ing to do so, relatively temperate if
his criticism is to remain consistently
valid.”

President Spencer is an honors
graduate of Davidson College and
holds M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from
Harvard University. After serving
as professor of history and dean of
students at Davidson, he was inaug-
urated as president of Mary Bald-
win in 1957

Twenty-five years ago, Dr. Spen-
cer himself was initiated into ODK
in Lee Chapel. He is a member of
Phi Beta Kappa and the author of
several historial and biographical
volumes

“On the campus as well as in so-
ciety at large,” continued Dr Spen-
ser, “the exchange of old problems
for new, or at least of old problems
for the Same ones in new form, has
been the essence of social history
The real leaders are rarely mere

A Reasonable Proposal

In last week’s editorial entitled ‘Paternalistic Discipline,”
we revealed the need for abolition of Saturday classes. This
change would allow both students and faculty a chance for
uninterrupted research, in addition to other benefits mentioned.
To summarize these, the student’s could use the uninterrupted
day for the writing of term papers, doing Honors work, and
studying for comprehensives. For the faculty, the extra day
would mean chance to do research at perhaps the Library of
Congress, Duke or Johns Hopkins. At present though such ac-
tivities require cutting classes.

The major difficulty in making such a change is obviously
the re-scheduling of Saturday classes. However, when local
colleges such as Hollins or Randolph-Macon, are able to
schedule their curriculum to avoid Saturday classes, surely we
can do the same. We do not propose the establishment of two
“reading days” as exist at Macon, but we do wonder why
something along the lines of the Hollins system cannot be
worked out. Hollins students are required to sign up for fif-
teen hours a semester just as W&L students are, there are
five periods for morning classes just as there are here, but
classes meet only five days a week. Or consider a hypothetical
system. The lack of Saturday classes would result in the length-
ening class periods on Tuesday and Thursdays, so that there
would be only four morning classes and the fifth period classes
would meet Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. Why could not
such a system be effected at W&L, provided of course that
fifth period Tuesday and Thursday classes thus scheduled
be liberal arts courses which would not generally conflict with
science labs?

We do not have an infallible or concrete solution to pro-
pose. We do wish to show that effective systems, avoiding
Saturday classes, have been worked out at other institutions
of comparable reputation. Any change in the present system
would involve a great deal of study; perhaps such a change
is not feasible at W&L from the technical point of view.

We do feel, however, that the question of abolishing Satur-
day classes merits the consideration of both the students and
the faculty and administration. The revised freshman curricu-
lum which went into effect in September, 1963 was the result
of a faculty committee which had been studying the question
and preparing a solution to the problem for a two-year period.
Why could not, or should not, such a study be made for the
purpose of determining whether the abolition of Saturday
classes is a practical possibility? This study would not necessi-
tate the doing away of Saturday classes; it would merely
study the possibility and determine whether any solution would
be a practical one. Its proposals would hardly be mandates;
they would be merely a solution set up for the consideration
of the student body and the faculty.

Lamb, Frazier, Defend, Oppose Integration

By LAMAR LAMB
Guest Writer

“Twenty-six million Americans can’t be wrong.” There
are petitions decrying integration because it leads to miscegen-
ation. There are bitter and cynical references to a very slowly
progressing Board of Trustees for being too liberal. All of
these are evidences of an element which is irrational in defeat
as it has been in conception. The fact is, integration is a dead
issue. The fact is, this column should not have to be written.
But, unfortunately, there are those who would revive the issue.
There are those who would reject the whole march of history,

intellect, and humanity in order to preserve their perverse and
immoral petty prejudices.
Right of Association

The sole plea of these men is
that their right of association is at
stake. There has not been, and ap-
parently cannot be, a rational de-
fense of their real aim: to avoid the
Negro, to preserve the basis for
pitiful paranoia. Instead the defense

is an irrelevant one—“my right
not to associate.”
The defense is one which is

thought to be philosophical and
designed to cover the real motiva-
tion which is recognized to be
indefensible. The real reason for
the outcry causes guilty feelings
which only makes the outery more
desperate, more unreasonable, and
more dangerous.

“The right of association stands
as the reason for segregation” is the
proclamation which stands for a
multitude of sins. There is no de-
fense for racial prejudice in the
proclamation, no analysis of the
problems racism brings; there is
really nothing relevant in the whole
defense.

No Justification

The fact that there can be no jus-
fication for segregation is reason
enough for Washington and Lee to

 

 

 

 

By SAM FRAZIER
Guest Writer

There is an old saying that the only good cause is a lost
cause. If this is the case, segregationists call themselves “good
guys,” because the idea of absolute segregation is now no-
where triumphant. There is no state which does not have at
least one integrated school, no place of business which can
feel securely segregated with the placard, “We reserve the
right to refuse service to anyone,” and no employer who
can assure himself that no member of the NAACP will ever
work for his company.

Even back home in Alabama, those who once cried
“Never! Never!” have changed their
plea to “Later! Later!” With the an-
nouncement that Washington and
Lee university—the Shrine of the
South, the Tomb of Robert E. Lee—
had opened its doors to applicants
of all races, the last fortress fell.
The cause is now lost, and even
George Wallace cannot save it.
Truth in Saying

There is, however, a_ certain
amount of truth in the old saying
about lost causes. The main argu-
ment which can be advanced for
integration is that it offers a greater
amount of freedom to a vast num-
ber of Americans. However, it would
be as big a mistake to assume that
segregationists are not concerned
with freedom as to believe that all
of us regularly burn crosses and
bomb churches.

The most basic of all our free-
doms is the freedom to choose. Our
elections are nothing else but the
exercise of this right. Futhermore,
we are not required always to make
the “right” choice in order to re-
tain the privilege of choosing; we
may discriminate. All of us chose to
come to Washington and Lee. For
most of us the racial coloration of
the student body was not the basis

 

accept Negroes as students. There
are many reasons for us to aid in
the break down of a decrepit sys-
tem whic hhas left us with a pro-

As Others See Us

 

of our choice, but for some, per-
haps it was. As a result of the re-
cent change in admissions policy,
these students will no longer have

prerogative of attending a

fusion of problems. There has been Sweet Briar Agress With Hollins, Sle school and remaining o

no responsible study of the problem
which has not come to the same
conclusion: that racial segregation
is an anathema to everything West-
ern Civilization has sought or hoped
for.

Still, the cry is right of associa-
tion, Let me ask those who make
this ery one question: If I, for no
defensible reason, decide 1 didn’t
want to associate with blue-eyed
people, would I have the right to
demand that this school, or any
organization, keep blue-eyed peo-
ple from me? In fact, there are
people at Washington and Lee
with whom I am perfectly happy
to have absolutely no association
at all. Yet, I do not demand, I
could not demand, that Washing-
ton and Lee send those people

To the Editor:

We are delighted to be presented
with the opportunity to evaluate
Washington and Lee students and
since the Editor of the Hollins Col-
ums thoroughly expressed our senti-
ments, we may sound repetitious.
Sorry, boys, it must be catching.

The allegorical fantasy which
appeared in the November issue of
the Ring-tum Phi brought up
many sound points. We of Sweet
Briar agree that although the
Washington and Lee “gifts to wo-
men” think they have their
“honeys” from “Sweets,” if they
are not careful, they will have

 

 

away.
How can you make this childish

plea? I should think you would be)

embarrassed to speak so loudly
where you are so obviously wrong.
First let us see a rational defense
of your position, first let us see
honest examination of your motives,
first let us see one, just one, rea-
sonable argument for your point of

Political Horizons

 

Goldwater’s Southern Strategy Analyzed

By BRETT HAWKINS
Assistant Professor
of Political Science

The so-called Southern Strategy of
conservative Republicans was
grounded in the belief that virtually
all of the states of the Old Con-
federacy would support Senator
Goldwater. This belief was buttress-
ed by arguments that the South was
inately conservative and liked Sena-
tor Goldwater, that it preferred a
tougher foreign policy, and that it
would respond with ballets to Gold-
water's vote against the Civil Rights
Act of 1964

These arguments were not neces-
sarily unreasonable, But certain
other factors were also in need
of serious consideration, among
them the fact that Johnsen was a
Southerner (or at least spoke with
a Southern accent), that the grow-
ing Negro vote would be over-
whelmingly Democratic, that the
South was heavily Democratic in
registration, that many Seuthern
politicians would seek to use the
coattails of the President, and that
some of Senator Goldwater's dis-
abilities would affect even South-
erners.

 

In order to place much confidence
n the Southern Strategy, then, one)
would have had to believe that the|
latter arguments could not be decis-

extraordinary firmness of partisan
allegiance, the degree of support for
social security and TVA (Gold-
water's actual positions here are ir-
relevant; his vulnerability is what
counts), concern about farm price
supports, and the probable loyalty
of many popular Democrates raised
serious doubts about the Strategy.

And there was a much weight-
ier problem. What effect would an
appeal to the South, especially if
it could be labeled “racist,” have
on many traditional Republicans
whose conceptions of the Party in-
cluded vague notions about Abra-
ham Lincoln and even, in some
places, the Grand Army of the Re-
public? This problem, of course,
raised the spectre of gaining the
South while losing many “tradi-
tional” Republic states.

In all, however, it must be ac-
knowledged that the Southern Strat-
egy was not an impossibility. But
the belief that solidly Republican
South could be used as a founda-
tion to erect a Goldwater victory,
especially against Johnson, was not
very convincing

Even less convincing was the no-
tion that the Republicans unde
Goldwater could make decisive in-
reads into the normally Democratic
allegience of the “ethnic minorities.”
Relevant political
has shown (1) that party allegiance,

the preponderance of people in the
“ethnic minority” category have a
full range of classically Democratic
characteristics and (3) that lower in-
come voters typically get their politi-
cal concepts by proxy from certain
opinion leaders (particularly labor
leaders) and have little appreciation
of abstractions (such as the econom-
ic order) or what the two parties
stand for. Futhermore, Goldwater's
candidacy was certain to provoke
a massive effort by organized labor,
which regarded the Senator from
Arizona as a grave threat to its
interests

In order to succeed in its ethnic
strategy, then, the Goldwater
camp would have had to devise
a workable scheme for gaining the
attention of a group whose atten-
tiveness to politics was minimal
and, to the degree that it did exist,
largely monopolized by the labor

| union leaders.

Arguments that the ethnic mineor-
ities would vote the backlash ticket
because they regarded the Negro as
a serious threat were, it seems to me,
unpersuasive. Such arguments as-

Student Novel

By BRUCE RIDER
Friday Columnist

This week I thought I would dis-
cuss my latest book, Happiness Is a
Warm Date.

I really didn't want to write a
book, but somebody has to represent
the University in the great world of
the printed page.

At many colleges, universities, and
cigar stores the faculties are forced
to Publish or to Perish. Not so at
Washington and Lee. Handball or
Perish, maybe, but not Publish or
Perish.

Thus it is up to us, the dynamic
undergraduates, before we turn
inte overgraduates, to take up the
responsibility of breaking into
print,

Here, then, are some of the par-
ticulars of my particular book. It
will be published by the University

This was emphasized recently when
a student said to his date, “I won't

little for the friend who was avoid-

any lack on the part of the Univer-

in the individual who was “too

We can appreciate comments made

last spring by your representatives |

at a conference who pointed out
that a girl who expects to be
treated properly and acts accord-
ingly, will be treated with due re-
spect. More and more girls are be-
coming aware that this is true and
are beginning to realize that they
need not put up with little boy
bravado which is meant to im-
press fraternity brothers instead
of dates. We applaud loudly the
student who makes an effort to
provide transportation for his date
to and from Lexington, but we can-
not condone the student who, wait-
ing for his date to arrive, quietly
or otherwise) crawls into his Bal-
lentine bottle, This may awe our
freshmen, but it does not make
them overanxious for a return en-

The upperclassmen here who still
date undergraduates at Washington
and Lee, generally “love ‘em all,”
but their statements are always
with “there are some
gross one, though.” Those thus con-
demned, like the student who stays
too drunk all weekend to know
that he has even had a date, are
the ones who give the student body
a bad name. They may be admired
by their fellow students as “the

last of the hardrocks,” but they
are not admired by Sweet Briar
girls

The problems of deportment are
not peculiar to Washington and Lee;
“Nay, there were few true Cavalier
to be found either.” But we are op-

better care of their dates and sit

New Coach Brings New Look--
Fast Break, Pressing Defense

By GUY UNANGST

Step right this way into a Never-Never land where
guards are points, forwards are wings and centers are
backs, where what looks like a zone defense is really
an “area man-to-man,” where there are no losses, only
“non-wins.”

Here there’s a door crowned by a sign proclaiming,
“We won’t be out-hustled.” Inside there’s a brand-new
luxury with carpeted floor and lockers replacing
the hooks and nails of olden times. Before games
there’s hot tea with an inch of sugar and “old fogey”
music, Afterwards there’s rock and roll.

Upstairs the men who inhabit the room run and
run and run—they walk only in the shower where the
man in charge admits its dangerous to run. One of
them wears a golden jersey—he’s “defensive player
of the week.” Near the door there’s a big round board
with the home schedule and everybody’s picture.

During games they'll fast break and play their
“goulash” defense and guards will play point, for-
wards wing and center backs. There'll be a four-piece
Dixieland band.

They've got their own blazers with a special de-
signed emblem, a new set of short-sleeved, fingertip
length warm-up jackets and matching warm-up jersies,
and their own brochure. There’s a weekly news-letter
and a 50-page instruction manual.

Already there’s a confirmed schedule for next year—
a 25-game schedule with a Christmas foray into
Florida and trips to Tennessee and Kentucky, Satur-
day afternoon games and seven new opponents.

What it is is basketball—W&L style—Verne Can-
field style—and the players love it.

It’s an aggressive style, with a “nose-to-nose” de-
fense from half-court on, and players will get what
Canfield calls “hustle bumps” on their knees. The of-

Unable to take its league cham-
pionship, the Law School neverthe-
less placed four men on the 1964
All-Intramural football team.

Law, which finished second to
ZBT in its league, placed offensive
guards Bob Pless and Andy Ander-
son, defensive end Phil Lotz and de-
fensive back Wayne Barnes on the
16-man team named this week by
football officials.

ZBT went on from its win over
Law to become eventual school
champion, and it took down the big
prize—most valuable player, which
went to end Murray Jacobson. ZBT,
which defeated SPE, PiKA and KA
in the playoff, also placed Earl
Magdovitz at a linebacker post.

The rest of the team: Offense—
End: Ashley Allen, KA; Center:
Conway Shields, PiIKA; Back: Dutch
Van Rensselaer, Phi Delt.

 

 

 

 

  

 

Defense—End: Tom Harden, KA;)

Middle Guard: Dave Shufflebarger,
PiKA; Linebackers: John

Back: Larkin Fowler, SPE.

PHI KAP, which took just about,

everything in the way of athletic
trophies last year, now holds a
slim lead over SAE in the cumula-
tive standings. Phi Kap has 395
points through fall sports, SAE 393,
ZBT 386 for third place.

The rest of the top ten: 4. Beta
375, 5. SPE 367, 6. Sigma Chi 365,
7. Delt 362, 8. KA 358, 9. PiKA 342,
10. Lambda Chi 337.

PHI GAM defeated
Wednesday to capture the League
A wrestling titl and reach the
finals with Phi Kap, Phi Psi and
SPE. The best: 1. Phi Psi 3-0, 2. Phi
Kap 4-0, 3. Phi Gam 4-0.

JIM BUSSART bowled a 215, John
Beagle a 208 to lead Phi Kap to an
869 game—high of the year—and a
win over Pi Phi. ZBT and Lambda
Chi also appear strong but are in the
same league.

ZBT, 20-9,

fense, free-wheeling attack which replaces the
“kcep-away” tactics of recent years, is designed as a
crowd pleaser.

“We've made a real good start. We haven't jelled
yet and we’re not going to jell for three or four ball
games. It’s going to take time—we’re not going to
change 10 years of losing overnight,” Canfield said.

Already he’s performed a minor miracle in trans-
forming a lackluster team that won four of 17 games
last year into an outfit that, on outward appearance,
seems ready to take on the world.

W&L opens an 18-game schedule tonight at Norfolk
when it meets Old Dominion, then follows with a
contest tomorrow at Hampden-Sydney. The home
opener is Tuesday against Bridgewater.

The schedule includes three new opponents—North
Carolina Wesleyan, one of the few schools that, like
W&L, gives no financial aid to athletes, District of Co-
lumbia Teachers and Pfeiffer.

Says Canfield, We're going to surprise a lot of peo-
ple.” He has, he has.

SAE Due For Fall

Kappa Sig, ZBT Are Favored

In Intramural Basketball
By CRAIG BARLEY

Sigma Alpha Epsilon’s domination of intramural basket-
ball is about to end.

SAE has taken three successive school championships and
won 22 games in a row. This year at least three teams are
better. Either Kappa Sig or ZBT will end the string, with
Beta a possibility.

SAE lost All-I-M players Henry Sackett and Fred Ridolphi

to graduation and 6-5 Gene Pearce to the varsity. Kappa
Sig has returnees Randy Poore (6-4)*
and Dave Ogilvy (6-5) and adds|
freshman Dick Hudgins, who will| NFU will field a squad, but cannot
send one of last year’s starters to
the bench. ZBT also has its whole
team back, and adds Murray Jacob-
son, who quit the varsity. Beta re-
tains its I-M-leading defense and
continues to dominate the back-
boards.

Both Beta and ZBT won opening
games this week. Beta ran over
Pi Phi, 48-13, with Bob Lohman
scoring 21 points. ZBT, Jacobson

Hal Holladay, hopes to upset the
Betas, but this is not very
Pi Phi lost last year’s leading I-M
scorer, Bill Manley, who fell
the academic wayside, and so prob-
ably won't win.

W&L Forward Fred Mindel (20) Adds Basket in T

Varsity Routs Freshmen, 102-42

 

Backcourt Is Key for WGL

A quartet of freshmen and sophomore guards appears the
clue to Washington and Lee success in the 1964-65 basketball

season.

At least so it seemed of sophomores Tom Cox, Frank
Morrison, Mike Saunders and freshman Larry Perrault in
Tuesday’s game scrimmage with the freshmen.

freshmen guards into numerous
mistakes and set off what seemed
an almost constant fast break.

|
When the freshmen did manage|

a shot, 6-5 center Bob Spessard or'|
sophomore forward Jeff Twardy re-|
bounded and passed to one of the|
four to start the break.

Twardy, when he wasn’t rebound-|
ing—and sometimes when he was,
and fellow forward Fred Mindel)
were usually in the midst of this|
new W&L tactic. Twardy led scor-
ing with 18 points, mostly lay-ups.

The varsity took the opening tip
and Morrison scored on a lay-up.
Twardy intercepted the first fresh-
man pass and scored, Morrison the
second throw-in, Cox then hitting
a short jump shot. Forty seconds
into the game the varsity led, 6-0.
| The

 

freshmen managed to pull
close, 14-12, but newly appointed
captain Dick Livingston hit two
quick baskets and the varsity went
on to a 53-26 half-time lead.
The varsity, after a sloppy first
half in which it might well have
out-rebounded, scored 14
| points in the first three minutes of
the second half, held the freshmen

SAE should still win League A,

 

where it is threatened only by KA.
Delt and Law complicate matters
for Beta in League B. With PiKA
beaten, League D looks like a ZBT
runaway.

In league C, Sigma Nu is a sleeper.
Actually, consensus is split between
it and Kappa Sig. Sigma Nu, with
Jolly Girard and Buck Clemente,
both All-I-M, returning, won its
opener, 36-29, from SPE. Girard

The varsity won, 102-42, but by so lopsided a margin only
after a second half-opening scoring outburst.

The four “points,” as coach Verne Canfield perfers to
call his guards, pressed a half dozen*¥— ———

 

a half minutes into the period and
romped to the easy win.

Canfield’s biggest loss is guard
Lou Paterno, who averaged 193
points a game last season. Paterno,
ineligible because of grades may
return to W&L law school and his
fourth season of eligibility next year.

Associated Press Poll
Names Generals’ David

Bill David, Washington and Lee’s
senior halfback, was named this
week to the Associated Press’ Little
College All-America team.

David, given an honorable mention
on the team, was the only Vir-
ginia player named. The AP chose
both offensive and defensive pla-
toons for the first time since 1953.

David, as a flanker, caught 44
passes for a W&L record. As a run-
ning back, he carried 30 times for
108 yards. David also led General
scorers with 26 points, including
four touchdown catches, and was
No. 1 man on kickoff and punt re-
turns.

Neither the All-State nor All-
College Athletic Conference teams
have yet been announced.

David, the Generals’ co-captain, is
the first Little All-American since
Terry Fohs made the team as a
center in 1961.

ODK Membership Policies

inexcusible ommissions was Lamar
Lamb. Not only had Lamb been an
Executive Committeeman for two
years, leader of the Independent
Jnion, and a dormitory counselor,
he was a Dean’s List student and
active in several important campus
organizations. He, too, was blithely
overlooked in last December’s tap-
ping. Lamb's position as a critic and
would-be innovator was the likely
reason for his rejection by ODK.

Friendship Qualification

On the other hand, several peo-

e admitted to the leadership fra-
ternity had pitifully few qualifica-
tions, As individuals, though, they
had reputations for right-thinking
(agreement with the powers that
were). In some cases, they were
close personal friends of the big
men in ODK. Indeed, this seemed
to be the only qualification in the
case of one or two boys.

We are in a period of re-exami-
nation. We hear constant warnings
of weakening traditions, and are ad-
monished to preserve those things
which made Washington and Lee
distinctive.

I am in agreement. We should,
surely, preserve the best aspects of
our past in building the future.
One of the things we should be
most proud of is our position as
birthplace of Omicron Delta Kappa.
It would be tragic, I think, to see
the Alpha Chapter of this organiza-
tion lose respect and esteem in the

eyes of the W&L student body. ODK
is a tradition worth keeping.

Let us then hope that future
memberships will be chosen more
justly and in accordance with the
tenets of ODK. At the writing of this
article, today’s tappings are not
known, so we cannot be sure wheth-
er a repeat of last year has taken

crucial is the way integration is
applied at Wé&L. If only a few
Negroes are admitted and nothing
else is changed, we can accept or
reject association with them as we
choose. However, it is unlikely that
such a situation would continue for
long. W&L, after all, is unique in
its social domination by fraternities.
If the University is to make good
its promise that Negro students will
be on an absolute plane of equality,
the opportunity for fraternity mem-
bership must be made available.

At least one organization on this
campus has already suggested that
we follow the policy of other schools
which have integrated and are re-
quiring each of their fraternities to
admit at least two Negroes a year.
This could not only deny us free
choice of association and make fra-
ternity bids meaningless but it
would also cruelly place certain
students in social associations where
they are not wanted. However, if
we are to have true integration
and actual interracial contact, clearly
more is going to be required than
a mere change in admission policy.

Cause Not Lost

In the final analysis, integration
provides freedom to a person pri-
marily as a member of a group, not
as an individual. Segregation with
all its obvious defects does confer
a certain freedom on the individual.

On the other hand, I believe that
the Senator could have done a
much better job of appealing to all

rather simple campaign tactic; he
should have continuously (ie.
every time he delivered a speech)

Views On Integration Of W&L

The choice between the two has not
really been made at W&L. We ac-
cept the principle of integretion
while retaining the practice of seg-
regation, As a result, we are really
only kidding ourselves about our
convictions. The old “cause,” then,
is not wholly bad nor truly lost after
all.

Lamb

(Continued from page 2)

view, then we can perhaps discuss
this matter.

Until you can do this, however,
it is foolish to cry out for irrele-
vant philosophical arguments, and
it is even more foolish to demand
that Washington and Lee keep
Negroes away so that no one will
have the right of inter-racial as-
sociation.

One final word: integration at
Washington and Lee doesn’t mean
that you will have to associate with
Negroes, it doesn’t mean you will
have to marry a Negro (it would be
difficult to imagine a Negro wanting
to marry you, or even your sister),
it merely means that Washington and
Lee is accepting its responsibility to
educate men, to provide a liberal
education, and help build that kind
of society about which Americans
have long dreamed and which has
never been so close.

GOP Economics

Adviser Attacks
Johnson Policy

Nutter Says Depression
Not Likely This Year; Hits

Johnson’s New Tax Cut

By Gareth Aden and
Rod Boren

Dr. G. Warren Nutter, Chairman of
the Economics Department at the Uni-
versity of Virginia, spoke last night
at duPont Auditorium. Dr. Nutter
was lecturing by virtue of the invi-
tation of the Young Republicans or-
ganization on campus.

The topic of the lecture was ‘Eco
nomic Policies of the Johnson Ad-
ministration.” Dr. Nutter has long
been an accepted authority on na-
tional economies and recently served
as an economic advisor to Barry
Goldwater.

Dr. Nutter began the program by

 

Dr. G. Warren Nutter speaking
to students and faculty at duPont
Auditorium Monday night.

 

analysing the new outlook of the peo-*
ple on the Presidency. He explained
that John Kennedy was the first step
in this change, due to the fact that
Kennedy represenaed something spe- |
cial and different to everyone. The
same is true of Johnson, said Nutter
except in a more calculated sense.
Johnson has made sure to promise
something to every economic group.
What to Expect

From this point Dr. Nutter launched
a long analysis of what to expect from
the Johnson administration. In John-
son’s attempt to please everyone, said
Nutter, he will continue a constant
inflationary policy. It was implied also
that the President would make sure
that there was not a business depres-
sion of any sort on an election year, by
regulating the economy in the right
fashion.

A number of administration pro-
grams have already been initiated,
he pointed out. First Johnson instigat-
ed a large, and according to Nutter,
unnecessary tax cut. Dr. Nutter ex-
plained that this tax cut had already
inflated too quickly and should have
been done more slowly. To alleviate
the inflation the tax cut had caused,
claimed Nutter, the discount interest
rates and debts were risen. The admin-
istration has also recently spent two
billion dollars on securities.

In the area of future legislation, Nut-
ter said to expect no stable policy from
the administration. “It will be pointed
to give a little to everybody, but in the
long run will accomplish very little,”
said the lecturer. Some small form
of Medicare Bill through social secur-
ity is to be expected, and if there is
to be any transfer of money, it will be
from young to old rather than rich
to poor. Nevertheless said Dr. Nutter,
there will be plenty more “War on
Poverty” programs.

Johnson's policy toward both labor
and management will be equally con-
ciliatory to each, surmised the speak-
er. He also foresaw a step-up in the
popular “give away” programs, ac-
companied by a cut-back in defense
spending. There is also the possibili-
ty of federal aid to education and
Grants-in-Aid to states.

Dr Nutter ended the lecture by re-
stating his belief that there was “no
coherent philosophy” in he current
President's national economic policy.
The implications of this broad trend,
said Nutter, could be disastrous for
the nation. A lively question and an-
swer period followed the lecture.

On December 13, at 8 o’clock p.m.,
the R. E. Lee Memorial Episcopal
Church will present a reading of
W. H. Auden’s For the Time Being:
A Christmas Oratorio.

James Boatwright, II, professor of
English and narrator of the work,
said: “The Oratorio is a dramatic
poem, interspersed with prose, for
several voices. The traditional char-
ters of the Christmas Story speak—
Mary, Joseph, the Wise Men, the
Shepherds, Herod. There are com-
mentary choruses as well.”

In all there are fourteen partici-
pants. They are drawn from the
W&L faculty and student body, from
the VMI faculty and from the towns-
people.

Mary is played by Mrs. George
Ray, Joseph by Professor Severn
Duvall, and Gabriel by Starke Syd-
nor. The chorus includes the Rev-
erend Mister J. Thompson Brown,
Professor L. R. Emmons, Professor
Brewster Ford, Mrs. William Sauder,
Gerald Coffman, Lockhart Hardley,
Mike Marcoux, Steve Millard, Mal-
colm Morris, and Jo Tartt.

The Oratorio was composed by
Auden during 1941-1942. Ie has been
performed by many church groups
and parts have been set to music.
The production here will be without
music.

Coordinators Report to EC

Positions Open For
68 Mock Convention

By FRANK FAIRCHILD, JR.

Newly-appointed Mock Conven-
tion Interim Co-Ordinators, Dave
Mayfield and Steve Saunders, pre-
sented their plans at the Executive
Committee meeting last night. After
establishing a Convention office,
they hope to correlate records of
past Conventions and to examine
sources of possible income.

The co-ordinators plan to insti-
tute an Advisory Board for the 1968
Mock Convention, consisting of
notable Republican leaders. It is
hoped the Board will include Gen-
eral Eisenhower, former Vice-Pres-
ident Nixon, ,Senator Goldwater,
Gov. Rockefeller, Ambassador Lodge
and ex-Gov. Dewey Other Party
leaders being invited are Gov. Seran-
ton, Congresaman Miller, Senator
Dirkson and the Republican Nation-
al Chairman (whoever that may be).
Aside from serving in an advisory
eapacity, the Board will lend new
prestige to the Convention.

Mayfield and Saunders plan to ap-
point a sophomore financial chair-

man, eight freshman regional man-

agers and two personal assistants.
Explaining the function of the reg-
ional managers, Steve Saunders
commented: “There are sixteen
executive committeemen on the Re-
publican National Committee. The
fifty states are divided up fer cam-
paign planning purposes among six-
teen committee members We are as-
signing the areas of two executive

Daily Worship
Periods Planned
For Lee Chapel

Dean Sprunt Announces
Tours To Be Discontinued
During Meditation Period

Historic Lee Chapel, where
Robert E. Lee attended daily
services when president of the
University, will again figure in
the spiritual life of students at
the university.

Beginning Sunday, December 6, a
15-minute period wil lbe set aside
daily except Sunday for meditation
or prayer by students, faculty, and
the public.

Tours through the chapel by vis-
itors will be discontinued during the
meditation period, but visitors will
be welcome to participate if they
wish, ,according to Dr. David W.
Sprunt, university chaplain.

Monday through Friday the medi-
tation period will be from 1:45 to
2:00 p.m. and on Sunday from 5 to

 

5:15 p.m., Dr. Sprunt said.

Richard V. Johnson, a freshman
from Chesapeake, Va., will play
sacred music at the chapel’s Erben
organ during the meditation period.

Lee Chapel was constructed in
1867 under the supervision of Gen-
eral Lee who attended daily wor-
ship servies there during his presi-
dency of Washington College from
1865 to his death in 1870. A small
plaque marks the pew where Lee
sat during these services. After his
death daily chapel services were dis-
continued, but voluntary regular
programs have been revived from
time to time for short periods.

Dr. Sprunt said the present plan
makes worship or meditation at the
chapel a voluntary, individual mat-
ter. He said that formal regular serv-
ices and vespers had been generally
unsuccessful.

“It was felt that the university has
a spiritual obligations to make some
use of the Lee Chapel for the pur-
pose for which it was built,” said
Dr. Sprunt.

Lee Chapel is a registered national
historic landmark which contains
the tomb of Robert E. Lee and his
family, the office Lee occupied when
president of the college, ,an,d a mu-
seum of Lee memorabilia, Over
40,000 visitors pass through the
Chapel annually.

 

 

glad to receive assistance from any
student who feels that he can be
of help with a particular region.
Applications for these positions are
currently being received.

One of the immediate programs
which will be undertaken by the in-
terim staff is a study of the tax stat-
us of the Mock Convention. In an at-

Coat & Tie Tradition
To Face Opinion Vote

By DON

Assistant News Editor
A student body referendum on conventional dress
and the Assimilation Committee will be held tomorrow, be-
tween the hours of 8:15 a.m. and 2 p.m. in Washington Hall.
The referendum, brought about by a student petition, is aimed
at giving students at Washington and Lee a chance to express
their views on the tradition of conventional dress dress and

 

Debaters Continue
hyo Season
In Pitts urgh Meet

By DAVE MARCHESE

Last weekend the Washington and
Lee debate team won seven out of
ten debate rounds in a tournament
at the University of Pittsburgh at

|| Pittsburgh, Pa. Such schools as Col-
| gate, Navy,

George Washington,
Miami (O.), and Maryland were
represented, and along with others,
made a total of 42 schools and 164
debaters competing for tournament
honors.

Debating the negative for Wash-
ington and Lee were Ed Fitzgerald
in his first tournament of the 1964-
1965 season, and freshman Kaz Her-
chold. Together they compiled a
tournament record of four wins to
one defeat, while the affirmative
team of John McMurray and Rick
Kneipper won three our of five
rounds. This performance marks the
12th straight tournament over a
three year span without a losing ree-
ord for McMurray, and the same
for Kneipper in six tournaments
over a four year period.

Of special interest was the fact
that the tournament included the
cross-examination form of debating.
In “cross-x,” as it is called, each
debater must not only present his
main speech and rebuttal, but must
also be prepared to answer direct
questions from the opposing team,
as well as be well versed in the
most penetrating questions he can
put to his opponents. This calls for
a thorough knowledge of the debate
topic.

This weekend the debate team
will be on the road again, this time
traveling to Wake Forest College
to take part in the Dixie-Classic,

where they will find themselves

confronted with a continuation of

the very stiff and experienced com-

petition which they have encounter-
ed the past three weekends. Work-
horse John McMurray and fresh-
men Jeff Wainscott, Tom Baremore,
and Hal Higginbotham, will be rep-
resenting Washington and Lee along
with successful debate coach Profes-
sor William W. Chaffin.

Probations for Academics Asked

By DAVE MARCHESE
IFC Columnist

Last night's meeting of the IFC
concentrated on a discussion of the
topics which were discussed at the
IFC Banquet earlier this year. The
idea behind this series of discussions
is an attempt to solve some of the
pressing and not-so-pressing prob-
lems that were deemed worthy of
discussion

While there were hardly any re-
actions to the first questions thrown
out to the representatives Ht took

Students will be asked to make
one of the following choices: 1) I
agree with the tradition of conven-
tional dress and the Assimilation
Committee as it stands now. 2) I
agree with the tradition of conven-
tional dress and the Assimilation
Committee, but I believe that there
should be some change in the pres-
ent operation of the committee.
(Write in exact changes in policy
that you would suggest as to what
is to be considered conventional
dress.) 3) I believe in the tradition
of conventional dress, but I do not
think it should be administered by
an assimilation committee. 4) I do
not believe in the tradition of con-
ventional dress.

No Immediate Effect

The result of the referendum,
although there can be no immediate
concrete effect on our present sys-
tem, will, if conslusive enough, start
the wheels of an amendment rolling.
The results will be made known
through the Ring-tum Phi sometime
before Christmas vacation.

Jim Kulp, student body president,
expressed the hope that students
would see fit to back the Assimila-
tion Committee in supporting the
tradition of conventional dress. Jim
complimented the committee for the
fine job that it has done this year.
He fells that “the committee is need-
ed to assimilate students, freshmen
in particular, to all the traditions
of the university, and to point out
the importance and benefits of these
traditions.”

Kulp also commented that at the
present time it would be impossible
to have the conventional dress tra-
dition without enforcement, a pro-
gram that has been proven inef-
fective on many campuses.

Brooks Brown

The Assimilation Committee, un-
der the chairmanship of Brooks
Brown, is “looking forward” to the
results of the referendum. The com-
mittee will study these results and
take steps which reflect the opinion
of the student body as a whole. It
is the expressed hope of both brown
and Kulp that each student will
give the referendum serious thought
before making a decision.

“We should not be influenced by
momentary whims,” said Kulp, “The
tradition of wearing a coat and tie
on campus has ben a long estab-
lished one which not only adds to
the appearance of our university, but
helps us in our goal to become true
Washington and Lee gentlemen.”

Could Still Function
If a majority of students vote to
free conventionai dress from the jur-
isdiction of the Assimilation Com-
mittee, the body could still exist

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Assimilation Committee Referendum

Conventional dress is not one of the things which
make Washington and Lee a great school. Even if the
tradition were to die, Washington and Lee would be es-
sentially unaffected. And so the furor over tomorrow’s
referendum, which cannot even abolish the Assimilation
Committee, much less vote out conventional dress, may
be somewhat exaggerated—particularly when seen in the
light of the quiet decay of the speaking tradition. The
speaking tradition, which is perhaps at a more advanced
state of decay than the coat and tie tradition, is also an ex-
ternal; yet it is a more genuine and a more effective one
than conventional dress.

Nevertheless, tomorrow’s referendum will be an im-
portant one, and perhaps a crucial point in the tradition
of conventional dress. If it is not an essential, conventional
dress is still one of the most attractive aspects of Wash-
ington and Lee and also of the elusive “Washington and
Lee gentleman.” The coat and tie give campus life, and
this includes classes in particular, a pleasant atmosphere.
Unquestionably conventional dress is favored by a huge
majority of students and faculty.

Ideally there should be no need for enforcement of
conventional dress, but evidently—a glance over the cam-
pus at any given time will prove—if W&L is to have
conventional dress, it had best be enforced. Since a tre-
mendous proportion of students wear a coat and tie, they
should not object to the Assimilation Committee be-
cause they should never even realize its existence. There-
fore—simply because the Assimilation Committee should
not offend those who never have to appear before it—
the Ring-tum Phi favors a standing Assimilation Com-
mittee. Such a committee, and only such a committee, can
enforce conventional dress by applying small penalties
to violators of the coat and tie tradition. Social pressure
cannot enforce conventional dress—as proved by U.Va.’s
experience—and neither can any loose machinery such
as cooperation between fraternity presidents.

The best choice, then, in tomorrow’s referendum, is
number two: a vote for an assimilation committee, but
with changes in its operation. The proposed change which
has received the most attention so far is to authorize
“wheat jeans” as conventional dress. Wheat jeans, how-
ever, are not a gentlemen’s attire and cannot be made
so by vote of a referendum, any more than could blue
jeans. To have the Assimilation Committee enforce wheat
jeans as conventional dress would be to reduce the com-
mittee to an absurdity; it would then be enforcing some-
thing as being “conventional” which cannot be called con-
ventional by any reasonable definition.

The change which is really needed in the Assimilation
Committee is more efficient administration. The commit-
tee ought to be able to avoid resentment and still be an
eficient enforcer of conventional dress, if it is adminis-
tered well. But the committee is hampered by demands
that its policies be explicity laid out for the student body.
Judicious administration should not be bound to a set of
rules, but should be at the discretion of the committee.
Thus the change to more definite policies, another often-
suggested change, would probably render the Assimila-
tion committee still more impotent to control violations
of conventional dress.

Number one on the referendum—the status quo—has
virtually no chance. Number four—"TI do not believe in
the tradition of conventional dress’—is also unlikely.
If number three—aimed at the abolition of the Assimi-
lation Committee—is the winner, the Executive Commit-
tee will be forced to call for a student body vote on
whether to free conventional dress from Committee en-
forcement by passage of a constitutional amendment. The
EC, though, would itself be unlikely to vote in favor of
the amendment, and so it would require a two-thirds ap-
proval from the student body. It is doubtful that the
amendment would receive this solid backing. So no mat-
ter what the results of tomorrow's referendum, not only
conventional dress, but also the Assimilation Committee
appear to be in no real danger.

Saturday Classes

The Friday Ring-tum Phi has based a request that Sat-
urday classes be abolished in the grounds that free Satur-
days would allow “uninterrupted research.” In actuality
the effect of abolishing Saturday classes would not be to
bring on additional research; the change would be in
allowing uninterrupted road trips. This would be a happy
change, to be sure, were it not for the disagreeable fact
that Saturday classes cannot really be abolished at all; they
would have to be shifted to other days. This would mean
more afternoon classes—which would interrupt not only
present research, but also labs, ROTC drill and class, and
sports activities. None of these latter activities are as neces-
sary at neighboring girls’ colleges, which are cited by the
Friday edition as examples of schools without Saturday
classes, as they are here.

The outstanding benefit of free Saturdays would un-
doubtedly be that professors would be able to do more

 

research than they can do now. They could use weekends
to travel to larger libraries for materials. However, the first
concern of the faculty is to teach students. If Saturday
classes are necessary for Se heduling of a full curricu
lum, and they seem to be, given W&L’s facilities and
faculty, then they must be retained, Still it would be inter-
esting to see the results of a full examination of the
curriculum, as proposed by the Friday edition, with an
eye to a possible shortening of the work week.

 

Lamb Explains ODK Refusal

 

Campus Critics, Agents of Change
Fail to Receive Recognition at W&L

by Lamar Lamb
Tuesday Columnist

My rejection of the honor given
me by ODK in last Friday’s assem-
bly has already
received far more
attention than I
expected and
more, I think, than
it deserves. Never-
theless, because of
the reasons for my
action, it is in-
cumbent upon me
to explain my
motives. There
are, I am sure,
those who are al-
ready sure they know the reasons
for my action. This column will be
of no interest to them. But it is my
hope that those who are curious
about my motives and those who are
interested in ODK leadership at
Wshington and Lee in general will
find food for thought in what I
have to say.

Simply, my rejection was lodged
as a protest against the method
and results of the selection of new
members to the “leadership fra-
ternity.” Since this year’s selec-
tions were secret up until the as-
sembly, it is obvious that I was
protesting action of past ODK
circles and not the prest one.
As far as this year is concerned,

I think the circle did a fairly good
job. I disagree with some selec-
tions and some omissions, but it
is obvious that full campus con-
sensus could never be reached in
such a matter.

The point at which I criticize
ODK, and at which I could never
join them, is one that has already
passed. It can never be rectified, but
I hope that members of ODK will
look to try to solve the problems in
structure and membership which
have caused errors in the past.

Since I have been at Washington
and Lee, I think I have seen changes
in the school—slow, inadequate
changes, but generally, changes for
the good. But ODK has consistently
failed to recognize the innovators
and critics who have been spokes-
men for, and agents of changes.
These are the people who deserve
the recognition for leadership at
least as much as past and present
members of ODK. It has become a
truism that criticism of the establish-
ed ways and leadership of Washing-
ton and Lee marks one as dangerous
or a misfit. Actually, several unrec-
ognized leaders of W&L have done
much more for this school than
veritable Dukes of Wellington who
have received honor for being
backward and petty.

Furthermore, there have been
and are members of ODK whose

 

Potential Republican JFK

 

principle characteristic is inoffen-
siveness and malleability rather
than intelligence and leadership.
Perhaps it can be argued that
that Washington and Lee is no
worse about this than any other
place. My optimistic nature, how-
ever, forced me to reject this
gloomy possibility. It is my opinion
that far too many of the so-called
leaders of this community are in
their positions because of what
they aren’t rather than what they
are. There have been members of
ODK who were members mrely
because they have adequately
served as superficial face men for
a corrupt power system.

My rejection, then, can also be
taken as a protest to a value sys-
tem which has allowed some of the
people who have been in leadership
positions to get there and which
has rejected some of the most impor-
tant people at Washington and Lee
as subversive or dangerous.

Any protest must be based on the
premise that things can get better.
And perhaps I can be rightly ac-
cused of being too idealistic in this
matter. But I acted in the belief that
things can get better at Washington
and Lee and in ODK. Whether this
is true or not, the fact remains
that ODK, at times in the past, has
not lived up to the goal it set for

John Lindsay: A GOP “Comer”

By STEVE SAUNDERS
Associate Editor

U.S. Representative John V. Lind-
say (R.-N.Y.) first achieved nation-
al prominence when he joined with
New York Senators Jacob K. Javits
and Kenneth B. Keating in refus-
ing to support the Republican na-
tional ticket in late July. But Lind-
say has long been prominent in
Empire State political thinking. A
story-book candidate with unrival-
ed aptitude for high public office,
he was marked as a “comer” from
the moment he was first elected to
Congress in 1958. In fact, he could
be the next President of the United
States, depending upon a tenuous
progression of “ifs,”

John Vliet Lindsay is the candi-
date professional politicians dream
about. He attended St. Paul's Schoo!
in Coneord, New Hampshire, and re-
reived his
and law degrees at Yale University.
He has an action-studded war ree-
ord and discharged from the
Navy in 1945 as a lieutenant senior
grade with five battle He is
handsome, personable, a superb
speaker, and well-respected by his
colleagues on both sides of the aisle.

In the Tradition of LaGuardia

A proud and unashamed liberal
Republican, Lindsay has no sympa-
thy with the ideas of Senator Gold-
water or other members of the par-
ty’s right wing. And with just
cause: Kieran O’Dougherty, a Gold-
water assistant at San Francisco, ran
against him on the Conservative
Party line this fall. Senater Gold-
water made no effort to keep
O’Dougherty from making things
hot for Lindsay.

Payne Urges Votes For
Assimilation Committee

 

 

 

To the Editor:

An old political addage
priately proposes that, “A
ant without a sword is no
ant at all.”

Generally, this is applicable to the
referendum to decide the fate of the
Assimilation Committee.

Assuming that the conventional
dress and speaking traditions at
Washington and Lee exist with pur-
pose and merit, what is the most ef-
fective means of preserving them?

appro-
coven-
coven -

Perhaps those who advocate the
demise of the Assimilation Commit-
tee upon the contention that a
“tradition” is voluntary and needs no
exterior enforcing mechanism are
correct. However, it seems to me
they are only circumventing the
question. In essence, it is a matter
of what form the sword will take,
and in this specific interest it is
either a social pressure or a fear
of being orally and financially rerp-
remanded by the punitive edge of
the sword. It is the former rather
than the latter which is the most ef-
fective enforcing mechanism in con-
forming to social standardrs.

There is however a tendency to
emphasize only the punitive edge of
the sword and to negate the essence
of the power that is the Assimilation
Committee’s.

In deciding the future of this
committee, we must consider the
seldom exposed blade of the sword
of power. I speak of the assimila-
tive function of he committee,
since its merit and purpose lie not
in finding habitual violators, but in
developing the importance and
and consequences of our traditions,
and in effecting assimilation of
freshmen into this specific aspect
of University life.

Of necessit: because there are
those who violate the unwritten
rules of the past and present Wash-
ington and Lee society, there must
be a method to effectively remind
these individuals of the accepted

ndard. Bssentially, this is a min-
imal task for most students adhere
or attempt in a relative fashion to
adhere to the tandard—which I
might edd, is a reasonable expec-
tation of a man } yaring himself
for society in genera

To those who contend that this
eniorein mecnanism transgresses
individual libert id stifles intel-
lectual and phi | independence,
I con only y that their contention
s basically unteneable and unrealis-
tic

In every seciety there are cer-
tain “accepted traditions” which
really have ne position in contro-
versy. To conform to certain basic
regulations, expressed or implied
is merely to pay the price for the
living in that society. Only when
the price becomes too high is there
ground for controversy.

A man whose liberty and individ-
ualism are stifled by wearing a tie
or by speaking to another has only
token liberty and individualism ob-
structed, and has little else to occu-
py either or both

The only I can find
with the Assimilation Committee is

serious fault

that the assimilative functions in a
hon-purilive manner are nol ex-
tended beyond the freshman camp

period to a greater degree than they
present, and that they are

Grapplers Down U N r For Second Victory

 

Final Freestyle Relay Win
Gives Generals Ist Victory

By SKIP CHASE
Tuesday Sports Writer

Washington and Lee swimmers managed a major upset
over their subsidized opponent Catholic University by a score
of 50 to 45 in the Generals’ season opener last Saturday.

Competing against scholarship athletes, Wé&L swimmers
pleased a small but enthusiastic crowd by coming from behind
twice and winning the squeaker with a victory in the final relay

 

 

Previously unbeaten, Catholic¥
University captured the opening! qus take a crucial first in the 200-
medley relay in decisive fashion. yard backstroke followed by fresh-

W&L was put right back in the
meet on the next event as Bill
Wildrick edged his opponent for
first and freshman New Lawrence
grabbel a valuable third.

Lead Gained and Lost

Catholic rebounded with a first in
the 50-yard freestyle but Skip Chase
and Bart Taylor placed second and
third respectively yielding only one
point. The following event, the 200-
yard individual medley brought
competitors and fans alike to their
feet as Tom Edwards and George
Bokinsky touched out their Catho-
lic opponent for a first and second
respectively in what was a “photo
finish.”

Now in the lead 18-16, the Gen-
erals under coach Norris Eastman
sensed victory and watched with
rising expectations as freshmen Tom
Clinnard and Rich Stevens swept
the diving to give W&L a nine point
buldge. Sensing defeat Catholic
roared back sweeping both the 200-
yard butterfly and the 100-yard
freestyle to regain the lead, 33-28.

Final Event Decisive

Determined to turn the trick, the

Gen nerals watched co-c aptain Broad-

 

man John Baker who grabbed a
third. With the gap sliced 34-36,
Lawrence and Wildrick stuck close
together and placed second and
third in the 500-yard freestyle.

Now three points behind, fresh-
man Kester Denman took a decisive
first cutting the margin to two
points and leaving the meet hinging
on the final event, the 400-yard free-
style relay. In the midst of church-
like silence the starter fired his gun
and pandamonium filled the south
wing of Doremus Gymnasium.

Freshman Edwardrs grabbed a
slim lead which he gave to Chase
who gave it to Bokinsky who gave it
to anchor man Taylor who held it
and thereby gave W&L its sweetest
and most surprising win in many
seasons.

 

NOTICE

It was announced today that four
erals were selected to the All-Vir-
members of the W&L football Gen-
ginia football squad. Bill David and
Joe Miller were selected to the first
team and Jeff Novinger and Starke
Sydnor received honorable mention.

Cagers Lose In First Two Games;

Tonight’s Game

By DICK DeWAUGH
Tuesday Sports Writer

“Disappointed but not discour-
aged, was the feeling expressed by
W&L basketball mentor Verne Can-
field after his charges lost two
high scoring contests over the week-
end. Friday and Saturday the Gen-
erals journeyed to Old Dominion and
Hampden-Sydney for their first
two regular season games.

Coach Canfield explained that the
W&L players “never quit” while
somewhat outmanned by a strong
Monarch team. The final 102-68

score does not reveal the real story
of the contest, he continued, while
the Hampden-Sydney win (118-86)
shows that win or lose, W&L fans
are going to see action this year
from their basketball team.”
Tonight following the freshman
prelim (which begins at 7 p.m.) the
Generals will meet Bridgewater Col-
lege in their first home game of
the year. The pep band will be pres-
ent and Coach Canfield promises that
W&L is “up” for this game, and he
and the basketball team urge W&L
students to come out and support

 

their team.

By TOM CARPENTER
Tuesday Sports Columnist

A high school football coach with
whom I am acquainted once said,
“It’s not how you play the game,
but whether you win or lose.” This
statement appears to cummarize the
philosophy of the average parrtici-
pant in the intramural athletics at
Washington and Lee. This general
procedure of ignoring rules as much
as possible seems to be caused by
personal candidates and a lack of
competent officials.

The football field is an excellent!

place for one to sneak in a few |

elbows under the chin of one of his
arch enemies. This usually causes
even greater animosity between the
two antagonists, and the fight be-
gins. At this time fraternity broth-
erhood comes to the front and every-
one rushes to the defense of his
brother, leading to the equivalent of
a gang war.
Where are the Refs?

And where are the referees? Cas-

This is not the only place in
which intramural officials fall below
acceptable standards. Some seem to
know less about the rules than the
players do. Some players ignore
more rules than the officials are
aware exist. Some officials appear
basically prejudiced. Some officials
are mere on the scene in order to
collect a $2 pay check. Some seem to
have no idea why they are officiat-
ing; others don’t officiate.

 

Not All Officials Incompetent
This is not to say that all of the
referees are complete incompetents.

MUSICK PINS—Dick Musick shows wrestling form that has made him 2-0

By JIM CROTHERS
Tuesday Sports Editor

Pins by Dick Musick, Kemble White and Warren Stewart
last night led Washington and Lee to its second wrestling vic-
tory in as many matches. After trouncing Virginia Professional
Institute, 40-0, last Thursday, the Generals feared a tougher

match with UNC but were able to handle the Tar Heels
easily, 23-10.

In the initial individual contest
of the evening Butch West started
W&L by decisioning his opponent,
5-3, before Musick pinned his 130
pound man early in the second
period. White followed this with his
pin with only 13 seconds left in his _
match to give the Generals a 13-0 ,
lead.

Tom Stover, in the 147 pound class,

ran against Javits for the Senate
in 1956, Javits piled up a neat ma-
jority. Javits might be the one to
unseat Wagner, but he has himself
stated that Lindsay must be consid-
ered a potential candidate.

If Lindsay runs for Mayor and
wins, he will be one of the most
powerful Republicans in the nation,
if not the single most powerful. In
that position he could ride the tide
of his popularity to the '68 National
Convention. If he ran and lost, he
could still run for Governor in 1966
and have a fair chance of winning:

I hope ODK will seek to establish
more objective standards of selec-
tion which will help eliminate some
of the pettiness that has entered
into past selections. And most im-
portant, I hope that ODK will take
to heart the words of the man who
spoke in its assembly, that there is
no leadership where there is not
effective, responsible criticism.

Chances are that Rockfeller will
forego a third four-year term in 1966
to make way for Lindsay. If Lind-
say is elected Governor, he will be
in an ideal position for the Presi-
dential nomination two years after-
ward.

Even if these things do not come
to pass in the next four years, Lind-
say is still not thrrough. He is only

ESQUIRE’S Fashion Director

Now it’s tame to make the suiting seene—and we've got news for
you! Not as far as styling’s concerned—your natural shoulder suit
with its plain, pleatless trousers is very much among those present!
But if you’ve a new suit on your agenda, ‘“‘The Three B’s”’ are
well worth investigating. They’re thrée new suitings you'll be
seeing on and off campus — Brigade Twill, Basketweave and
herring’Bone. Let’s take an in-depth look at them.

THE LIGHT BRIGADE RIDES AGAIN

in light, natural tones of Brigade and
Cavalry Twill. These hard-wearing,
smooth-finish fabrics can take an amaz-
ing amount of punishment without losing
their shape. You’ll find them in erisply
tailored traditional suits, many with wide
welt seaming as an added refinement.

BANK ON BASKETWEAVE, « abr

newly revived for suits, sport jackets and
slacks. It’s a somewhat smaller, tighter
version than before, with a fine-grained
‘*look of the hopsack.’’ Camel color comes
on strong in Basketweaves, as do muted
heather mixtures.

BONES ARE THE BACKBONE of the col-

    
  

lege man’s wardrobe — a favorite and
fashion-wise choice. The small, classi¢
herringbone weave is particularly popu-
lar_in black-and-white or black-and-gray
combinations, but don’t overlook the
more unusual ’Bones—in blue, perhaps,
with a touch of green.

THE BOLDER THE BETTER is the an-

swer, when it’s a question of accessories!
Stronger, more colorful stripes and checks
identify this season’s shirts. The range
runs from a conservative choice like wide
gray and tan striping on white oxford to
narrow, bright-red stripes for more ad-
venturous types — and checks run the
gamut from pinchecks to ginghams to
Tattersalls. Even the perennial oxford
shirting gains new power by combining
two and three colors in the weave, as do
the newer twill and herringbone weaves.

‘An Enemy of the People’

By MIKE DUNN
Associate Editor

An Enemy of the People, Henrik
Ibsen’s drama of social criticism, will
be presented beginning February 17
as the Troubadours’ second produc-
tion of the 1964-65 season.

Ibsen’s play is a study of the indi-
vidual against society. In a small Nor-
wegian town, a doctor discovers that
carelessly-laid water pipes and local
industry have contaminated the water
supply. To his surprise, his fellow citi-
zens refuse to act. Ironically, they
meet in a democratic town council and
vote to ignore the truth rather than
speak out against authority.

Tryouts Held

Tryouts for the roles were held last
Wednesday night at the Troubadour
Theatre. The leading role, Dr. Thomas
Stockmann, will be played by Trou-
badour president Charlie Bright.
Starke Sydnor will play Peter Stock-
mann, the mayor of the town, while
Lockhart Handley has the role of Mor-
ton Kiil, a factory owner.

Other parts announced include Lew
Davis as a newspaper editor, Bob
Hudson as a reporter, and Steve Mil-
lard as Horster, a ship’s captain. Jay
Hight will be the printer Aslaksen, and
Tim Webster plays a drunk.

Other townspeople will include Jim
Settle, Roger Clark, Fred Suttle, Frank
Fairchild, Jay Cady, George Kistler,
and Ward Briggs. No more parts have
been announced yet.

New Version
“This play is perhaps Ibsen’s best
social criticism,” said Dr. Cecil D.
Jones, director, “but it does have

Give Ibsen’s

something to say. It deals with the
courage which the individual requires
in every time. The events in this play
can happen today just as well as in
the 1890's.”

Dr. Jones added that Ibsen is only
slowly regaining popularity in the
English-speaking world, because for
many years stilted, outdated Victorian
translations of his works were the only
ones available. The Troubadours will
use a new adaptation by playwright
Arthur Miller which uses a more mod-
ern speech. This, said Dr. Jones, does
away with the “Victorian period piece”
atmosphere of the older versions.

The cast for An Enemy of the People
will begin rehearsals next week.

The Troubadours first play of the
year, Shakespeare’s The Merchant of
Verice, drew capacity audiences dur-
ing its four day run in November. It
also received critical praise from re-
viewers.

Anyone interested in acting in Ib-
sen’s play should see Dr. Jones im-
mediately. He stated that a few parts
are still open. Others interested in
working on the play in production of
sales capacities are asked to contact
either Dr. Jones or Charlie Bright.

Dr. James Silver To Make
Address, Conduct Seminar

By LARRY MEEKS
Managing Editor
Dr. James W. Silver, author of Mississippi: The Closed
Society and past president of the Southern Historical Associa-
tion, has accepted an invitation to be one of the principle
speakers at CONTACT, Washington and Lee’s IFC sponsored

intellectual symposium.
Announcement of his acceptance came in a special meeting

of the CONTACT Steering Committee with its faculty advis-
ors, Mr. Whitehead, Dean Atwood, and Dr. Moger of the Fac-

ulty Committee on Lectures.

Dr. Silver has been a member of the faculty of the Uni-
versity of Mississippi for some twenty-eight years. He is cur-
rently on a year’s leave of absence to teach and study at Notre
Dame.

His book, Mississippi: The Closed Society, has received
great acclaim both as an address he gave as President of the
Southern Historical Association and as a book. It appeared on
the “Best Seller’ list of the New York Times Book Review for

fourteen weeks and Book Week magazine has listed it as one
~ *of the best works for the year 1964,
especially noting his acute analysis
|0f the Mississippi problem.”
Professor Lewis Atherton of the
University of Missouri, in reviewing
Dr. Silver’s book says that “Silver
has written a highly important book,
both timely and timeless in nature...”

To Keep Conventional Dress

By BILLY CANNON

News Editor
The student body in a referendum
on conventional dress and the As- |
similation Committee held Wednesday |
voted overwhelmingly to preserve the
tradition of conventional dress on the |
Washington and Lee campus and sup-
ported to a lesser extent the Assimila- |

tion Committee as it now stands.

 

The referendum, brought about by
a student petition, showed 89.3 per |
cent of the student body in favor of |
conventional dress. Of the 464 per
cent of the students who voied, 59 per
cent felt both conventional dress and
the Assimilation Committee should re-
main. However, 65 per cent of the bal- |
lots indicated some criticism of the |
way the Assimilation Commitice is
being run. |

Students were asked to make one
of the following choices: 1) I agree
with the tradition of conventional dress
and the Assimilation Committee as it
now stands. 2) I agree with the tradi-
tion of conventional dress and the As- |
similation Committee, but I believe |
that there should be come change im)

“I don't think it's a burden on any

lack of spirit, however, has hurt it.”

Wednesday's referendum was the
culmination of a controversy which
had raged over this campus for the
past five years. It marked the first

dents. The subject of this seminar will
be an unpublished paper that he has

interested students should apply for
these positions by writing to CON-

Students participating in the sem-

Apathy In The Academy

A club long in existence, but heretofore unrecognized, on
the W&L campus has finally been chartered.

 

 

 

The constitution of the “new” Apathy Club has been of- |

ficially drawn up. “The action was taken,” a spokesman for the
group said, ‘in order to help crystalize—or perhaps coagulate
a feeling that has been prevalent on this campus for a long
time.” The purpose of the club will be “to vegetate, thus mak-
ing any worthwhile project or endeavor on campus as much a
failure as possible.”

“As you know,”
we have a great problem. We hope to bring that problem to the
attention of the student body.” He then read the charter in
full:

We, the students of Washington and Lee, in order that we
may become completely lackadaisical and incompetent of good
judgment, and guided by a disorganized and disconcerted
effort, do hereby establish this constitution toward a philoso-
phy of non-commitment at WeL.

This do-nothing body shall henceforce be known as the
Apathy Club of W&L. Its motto shall be: ‘Omnia pro me et
ego pro nullo,’ which translated, means: ‘All for me and me
for none.’

In
*

this organization there will be:

No officers, for this might stir interest, create re-
sponsibility, and lead to competent performance of
duties.

No dues.

Meetings once every two years in the old Co-op,
anyone attending being subject to immediate dis-
missal from the organization on the grounds of
showing interest in anything—even apathy.

*
*

Those who are allowed to be in this elite group must prove
that they are not active members in any other organization on
campus and that they have done nothing responsible or in the
least requiring initiative. To qualify they must: a.) never ask
questions in class other than required test material, how long
term papers should be, if they should be typed, etc., b.) be
completely silent at all athletic events unless they are

Our Neighbors Down the Street

 

Student Life Radically Different At V M1

By Warren Montgomery and
John Yager
Feature Editor, Cadet First-Classman

The most striking aspect of W&L-
V.MI. student relations is their virtual
non-existence. Most W&L_ students
know more about
U. Va. 75 miles
1| away, in Charlot-
tesville than about
our next - door

neighbors at V.M.I.
' This mutual iso-
| lation of V.MLI. and
| W&L is due, to a
large degree, to the
| staggering differ-
ences between the
two schools. They
are so dissimilar
that there remains no basis for co-

their joint efforts make the town of
Lexington possible.
A Parting of the Ways

The chasm between V.M.I. and W&L
opens with the arrival of the freshmen
in Lexington in September of each
year. Both freshmen enter the town
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, eager
to learn, and innocently enthusiastic
about the colleges of their choice. One
freshman first sees a masterpiece of
ante-bellum Greek-revival architect-
ure, reeking with liberal education and
tradition. The other sees a squat, yel-
low fortress complete with battle-
ments, portcullises, turrets, gargoyles,
shutes for pouring boiling sulfur on
the enemy, and other innovations of
modern warfare.

After a few enlightening days at
freshman camp, the W&L frosh goes

 

operation, rivalry, or association be-

tween them. About the only thing mel

two schools hold in common is that

organization.

These members may attend social events on one condition: | ;

fairs whether held by the University or not. The truly un-

pardonable sin is to be any member’s personal involvment with | %;
any person on other than an objective plane. Members must} ’

regard others as objects.

This constitution will be duly ratified if a majority of the
student body who can prove they have not voted since their
first semester at W&L or showed any interest in anything at
all recognize this club to be worthwhile.

When asked how students could recognize this club to be
worthwhile and yet remain apathetic, the spokesman would
make no comment.

The Referendum

W&L’s unusual student referendum has been held, and the
statistics are in. We do not yet know whether the Executive
Committee will act on the results of Wednesday's vote, but
there are several conclusions that are immediately apparent
from the results.

Unfortunately, only 47 per cent of the student body vot-
ed. The best that can therefore be said for the results of the
referendum is that they are possibly indicative of the wishes of
the student body, but that they are certainly not conclusive.
On the basis of the meagre vote, we can make some good
guesses but no definite statements.

We were pleased to note that 89.3 per cent of those who
voted checked off items 1, 2, or 3, on the official ballot, all of
which expressed basic agreement with the tradition of conven-
tional dress. As inconclusive as the total vote might be, we
hope that a nine-tenths vote for conventional dress _ will
strengthen its enforcement in the future.

On the other hand, 65 per cent of those who voted checked
items 2, 3, or 4 on the official ballot. All of these items ex-
pressed some degree of dissatisfaction with the administration
of the Assimilation Committee. Again, in light of the total
vote, this statistic is unreliable, but it is to be hoped that the
Executive Committee will give some consideration to the vari-
ous criticisms written on the referendum ballots.

Political Horizons

 

By Brett W. Hawkins
Assistant Professor of Political Science

A frequently noted characteristic of
American politics is that the fervent
partisan, observing that his party has
lost an election, resists the conclusion
that the public is departing from his
that his party, by compromising its
principles to win the votes of the cen-
ter, has left a large body of its follow-
ers too disgruntled to participate in the
election.

This kind of plausible argument is
often very useful, as its frequent ap-
pearance attests. Most recently, of
course, it served the cause of con-

 

Cinema Review Editor |

servative Republicans, who evidently
believed (1) that there was a large
group of “disgruntled” Republicans
who had not participated in elections
since Herbert Hoover and (2) that a
considerable proportion of the other
non-voters (independents and Dem-
ocrats) would support a man who of-
fered them a meaningful choice.

Evidence for Beliefs

What kind of evidence existed to
support such beliefs? Very little in
fact. Two kinds of propositions were
offered, however. The first suggested
that one personally knew of this or
that individual, or group, who had re-
fused to vote for “liberal” Republi-
cans. The second suggested that the
1956 election shattered the notion that
non-voters are inevitably more Dem-
oeratic than the electorate as a whole,
for in that year the non-voters inter-
viewed after the election were over-
whelmingly in favor of General Eisen-
hower.

The first proposition, as evidence,
can only be termed ridiculous. Any
insistence that personal experience of
this sort is significant might be of in-
terest to psychologists, but not to
political scientists. The second propo-
sition, however, cannot be dismissed so
easily. It is very true that a 1956 study
dealt severe blows to a proposition
that had become one of the axioms of
American politics

derful fellow he is (e.g., “It was so
nice to have you down to the
house—drop by to see us some-
time”). The V.M.I. freshman, or
“rat” as he is thereafter called, un-
dergoes one week of intensive mili-
tary training. He learns to drill,
grovel, drill, cringe, drill, fawn, drill,
and shine shoes.

Protective Guidance

As time progresses the W&L fresh-
man is amazed with the change be-
tween life at home and life at college.
At home, he is under the protective
guidance of his parents; at W&L, he
has complete freedom to do whatsoever
he wishes, short of violating the law
too blatantly. The V.M.I. rat is also
amazed at differences between life at
home and life at college. At V.M.L, he
is placed under the protective guidance
of an upperclassman “dike.” This dike
(or big brother) gives the rat moral
support and an occasional paddling to
teach him to be more grateful. In ex-
change for these inestimable services,
the rat must merely spit-shine the
shoes of his dike, make his bed, clean
his room, boost his ego with reptilian
subservience, perform various chores
and errands, and serve as a foil for
the dike’s incidental pugnacity.

The rat is kept in top physical
around

the parade ground, supervised by
the ever-benevolent upperclassmen.
His mind is sharpened by memoriz-
ing a 40-page Rat Bible containing

It is a fantasy world of low lights,
loud music, too much liquor and a
sensation of forced fun. It is a world
of repetition in which week-ends are
easily juxtaposed, shuffled, and shift-
ed—last weekend, this weekend, and
one weekend two years ago—they blur
and are remembered only for certain
incidents, if remembered at all.

It is a world of the image—the
stud—the stallion free, yet bound by
his role and ever in pursuit.

The language is jargon—interspersed
with “great images” lifted from Eliot's

impregnably formal balls. The ignor-
ant rat eagerly anticipates these af-
fairs, but the upperclassman knows |
better. He spends the dance impatient-
ly waiting for the end of the dreary
performance so he can furtively head
for the hill behind the institute with
a blanket, his date, and fifths of bour-
bon clutched in each hand. It is, inci-
dentally, a dismissal offense to be
caught drunk or in the possession of
liquor.

Sunday mornings’ entertainment
consists of a rousing march to the
church, followed by a sterling ser-
mon, and perhaps even a starchy stroll
with one’s date around the streets of
the metropolis.

Step-off

When W&L students have com-
plaints about the system (and these
are few and strained), they write a
letter to the editor, or start a petition,
or more likely, simply lapse into their
customary apathy after a little con-
servative grumbling. At V.M.I., open
complaints are rare and mercifully
suppressed if directed against upper-
classmen by a rat. Every few years or
so, however, the stored-up protests
penetrate the iron-clad V.M.I. regimen.
On such occasions, such milktoast no-
tions as letters or petitions are thrown
to the winds. What follows is a full-
scale insurrection, otherwise known as
a “step-off.”

In a step-off, after a Ist class
(senior) meeting, the president of
the class orders the rats to “step-
off the rat line” (i.e., untuck their
chins, turn by increments of 45 de-
grees if they so wish, walk in the
middle of the hall, etc.). Mass de-
struction of the barracks follows.
Led by a first-class organization
known as the Dirty Thirty, the rats
and cadets first cut V.M.L’s meagre
communications with the world, the
telephones and power lines. Next,
they burst all the plumbing by sim-
ultaneously turning on and shutting

brink of sobriety, almost, sometimes,
letting themselves be seen and
heard—allowing feeling and com-
munication—even to such a world
as this, where the weeks are three
days long, with a mysterious five-
day void between, an hour and fif-
teen minutes away (it can be done
in under an hour, especially if you're
late).

There is little fascination, there is
little to discover, the pattern remains

Plan For Lee College
Might Be Surrender
Of Ivy To “*Bigness”
By TRACY HARRINGTON
Friday Columnist

Regrettably, there has been little
discussion of the “Lee College” pro-
posal.

To recap: Dr. Cole in his opening
address suggested that the present
W&L become “Washington College,”

and that a newly established “Lee
College” become a twin institution.

Friday
Columnist
Harrington

Together, the colleges—separate but

equal, as it were— would form Wash-
ington and Lee University
WA&L’s Obligation

Since that initial bombshell, public

analysis of the idea has been near-
ly nil. This is unfortunate; for the
proposal should be examined careful-
ly, and, in this writer's opinion, dis-
carded.

If I recall correctly, Cole's main ar-
gument for Lee College was that it
would be a necessity in order for

W&L to “fulfill its educational obli-
gations of the future.”

Why? Washington and Lee's ob-
ligation, it seems, is to provide the best
liberal arts education it can; to grow
in academic excellence; and to pre-
serve the small college personal at-
mosphere that prevails. Cole really
seems to be saying that it behooves us
to increase our numbers because there
are look uw
educations. Our obligation, he intimat

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Eagles Edge by Generals, 87-81
Seek First Win Against Centre

By GUY UNANGST

A high-seoring guard-forward com-
bination made coach Verne Canfield’s
Doremus debut an unsuccessful one
Tuesday. Tomorrow night another
such combination comes to town.

With Bridgewater’s All-State guard
Paul Hatcher scoring 34 points, 14 of
them on free throws, and Joe Browder
23, Washington and Lee lost its home
opener and third straight, 87-81.

Outshot from the floor, Bridgewater
had the benefit of five W&L foul-outs
and 43 foul shots.

Tomorrow’s opponent, Centre, brings
juniors Mike Marks (6-4) and Julian
Palmer (5-11), both All-College Con-
ference, Last season they were one-
two in team scoring, averaging 33.4
points a game total.

Hoping to cut down the number
of fouls against Centre (W&L has
fouled 86 times in three games), Can-
field had this week’s practice sessions
officiated.

With Hatcher's

overcame a 32 per cent second half
accuracy for its six point spread.

Jeff Twardy’s lay-up gave the Gen-
erals the lead, 59-58, early in the sec-
ond period. W&L moved ahead four
points, but Bridgewater tied at 68,
then moved six points in front after
Twardy and Tom Cox fouled out.

Thereafter, W&L never got closer
than three points. Bridgewater pulled
away on free throws in the closing
minutes.

The Generals hit 54 per cent of their
shots while holding the Eagles to 41
per cent and but a dozen second half
field goals. Their harrassing defense,
however, fouled 31 times, and too of-
ten it fouled Hatcher. The 6-0 senior
made 14 of 18 free throws.

Centre beat W&L by 16 and 18
points in two games last year. Last
year it was 14-8, and second in the
CAC.

Tuesday, with 23. He’s hit 17 of 28

Although primarily a pass receiver,
David also carried the ball 30 times

On defense, David, as a corner back,
was all over the field making key

Head Coach Lee McLaughlin praised
David this season when he said David
had the best pair of hands he had
ever coached. McLaughlin added he
viewed David as a potential prospect
at flanker back. He added that David
was the first W&L boy whom he has

McLaughlin has said that David is

couldn’t adequately defend against
him in practice, even though they
knew the patterns he was running.

ed, is to grow numerically as well as
intellectually,

The United States is today plagued
by Bigness. The thesis that quality in-
evitably means quantity reigns su-
preme. Universities are no longer
single institutions. They are huge com-
plexes of buildings and bureaucracies,
where education is mass production
efficiently overseen by screeching,
whining computers. The government
and large foundations sanction this
monolithic mania with generous of-
ferings of funds.

What President Cole has suggested
would in no way make Washington
and Lee into one of these ivy-covered
IBM’s. But the very fact of his pro-
posal can be viewed as a sort of com-
promise, a gesture of conciliation with
the powers of Bigness that be. Wash-
ington and Lee has enough to do with-
out doubling its size; indeed, this

off all the toilets, faucets, and show-
ers in the barracks. Finally _,the
furniture is thrown down from up
to three stories high into the court-
yard, windows and light bulbs are
smashed, and the walls are smeared
with paint. Periodical step-offs are a
tradition at V.M.1.—the last occur-
red in 1961 and cost $7,000.

The W&L student generally looks
down with varying degrees of pity on
the V.MI. cadet. He also perhaps sub-
consciously admires anyone who can
endure such a wretched existence. The
cadet wishes he were a W&L student,
but after graduation (at which time
he has attained the high honor of 2nd
lieutenant cannon-fodder) he becomes
the world’s most fanatic alumnus.

It would be almost impossible to
comparatively evaluate V.M.I. and
W&L because of the almost total lack
of a common basis for comparison.
Certainly, the W&L mink is happier
than his veemie counterpart, and in
this respect, W&L is better. Howev-
er, the end accomplished and not the
method of accomplishing it is what is
important in the long run, and V.M.L
ean certainly compare with W&L
for the number of prominent men
that have been trained there.

seems a rather curious course to take,
when there are so many more con-
structive options open for future de-
velopment.

The money and efforts which would
go into creating Lee College can better
be expended in perfecting the school
we already have. The library needs
expanding; departmental facilities and
faculties can certainly be improved.
Increased salaries could help us keep
the good men we have and bring new
ones to the campus. Seminars, guest
lecturers, research opportunities for
students—these are the areas which
need study and attention, and to which
we should direct ourselves rather than
to plans of simple expansion.

There are purely practical consid-
erations, too. From where is the en-
rollment for Lee College to come?
W&L already has enough trouble
maintaining entrance standards. A
doubled amount of acceptances would
necessitate a doubled amount of ap-
plications if present standards are to
be kept. How does President Cole plan
to insure this? What about town fa-
cilities? Can Lexington support two

I have, after some deliberate delib-
eration, come up with a solution which
will solve all of these problems and
get our fair campus back upon its
collective feet once more.

What we must do is to make the
new Lee College a college for fe-

Washington and Lees? It can hardly
support one, as Dr. Cole could readily
observe were he to watch students
trying to get restaurant service at the
dinner hour on Sunday.

One might agree that the establish-
ment of Lee College would provide a
welcome stimulus to Lexington; and

so it would. Business would boom.
But this is hardly a valid considera-
tion, since our primary concern is

Washington and Lee as an educational
institution and not the enhancement of
Lexington’s economy.

Washington and Lee’s status as a
small liberal arts college gives this
university a special kind of unique-
ness. That uniqueness, I predict, will
become increasingly valuable and at-
tractive as more and more colleges
submit to Bigness. It remains for us
to strive toward perfecting our small
liberal arts college, to grow academic-
ally and intellectually; in these direc-
tions should our efforts and interests
be turned, not in the direction of a
numerical growth which is neither
necessary nor in the best interests of
Washington and Lee’s objectives.

there in the countryside we could
have, say, Sarah Lee College. This
sister institution will solve most if
not all of our problems and enable
us to once again devote our full at-
tention to what college is All About
(whatever that is).

Lf

First of all, the presence of Sarah
Lee College will solve any difficulty
and rebelliousness (“man is born free
and everywhere he is in coats and
ties”) we may have had with Con-
ventional Dress. If there are gals near-
by we will all want to dress in our
best snowsuits and be clean and neat
and coatie and tieie to attract a fair
maiden to our individual lairs.

And, hand in hand, so to speak,
will follow our Speaking Tradition.
Most of us always say something to
every girl we pass so that we would
be most happy to continue this in
our contacts with Sarah Lee.

Most of our weekend hazards of
driving to Faraway Places to find com-
panionship will be eliminated by hav-
ing women on our dorstep. Any free
Saturdays the faculty grudgingly per-
mits us to make use of would be spent
in Lexington and not on trips up or
down or across the road. And it is psy-

to Sarah Lee than to voyage many
miles to find out that she has a head-

ers than on voters. (These conclusions
are based on data from the 1948, 1952
and 1956 elections.) It therefore seems
reasonable to be guided by John F.
Kennedy’s 1960 victory, plus the emo-
tional stimulus of the assassination,
to the conclusion that by 1964 most of
the non-voters should have been firm-
ly in the Democratic camp. The al-
ternative conclusion, it seems to me,
is highly implausible.

Acceptance Speech
Another assumption entertained by

the Goldwater strategists was that the| Goldwater was legendary and

“other”

 

turn to the fold without overt concil- |
iatory gestures, apparently in the be- |

lief that they would have no choice.
The crucial question here, of course,
whether conditions in some states per-
mitted the other wing to exert itself
for a comparatively doctrinaire ticket,
such as one representing two conser-
vatives, each with a problem of being
associated with “extremists.”
Perhaps the most pertinent fact here
was that the refusal of the conserva-
tives to budge on platform provisions,

}on the choice of a vice-presidential

candidate, and on the crucial accep-
tance speech played into the hands of
those who argued that conditions in
some states dictated a shun-Goldwat-
er approach, regardless of whether the
latter were factually correct or not.
It is my personal opinion, indeed, that
Senator Goldwater’s unfortunate ac-
ceptance speech totally destroyed his

chances of a decent showing at elec-
tion time. No man who enters a cam-
paign with such disabilities can hope
to do well by reinforcing those dis-
abilities in his first important public
address.

It is also my personal opinion that
the usual conciliatory approach on the
platform, the running-mate, and the
acceptance speech—plus an abandon-
ment of the Southern Strategy—would
have held in tow virtually all of the
traditional Republicans. It would also
have held the great bulk of conser-
vatives, whose affection for Senator
who

wing of the Party would re-| truly had no place to go. In the ab-

sence of holding the election over
again, however, and applying the above
strategy one can never know whether
it would have “worked.”

W. Auden Play Presented

At Robert E.

By CHARLES LIVINGSTON
Associate Editor

For the Time Being, a Christmas
oratorio by W. H. Auden, was present-
ed last Sunday night in the Robert
E, Lee Memorial Episleopal Church.
Individuals of the church, V.M.L, and
the University read the long poem to
a small audience of some professors
a small audience of some professors,
some townspeople, and a few students.

The Participants

Professor James Boatwright orga-
nized and narrated the reading. Pro-
fessors Boatwright, Emmons, and Du-
vall and students Gerald Coffman,
Lockheart Handley, Starke Syndnor,
Jo Tartt, Steve Millard, Malcolm Mor-
ris, and Michael Marcoux participated
from Washington and Lee. Mrs. Eliz-
abeth Ray, wife of English professor
G,. W., Ray, read the role of Mary, Tom
Brown, Brewster Ford, and Nanalou
Sauder shared in the presentation. Few
participant read well, particularly
singly. The choruses were commenda-
ble especially considering the great
difficulties of choral reading.

Theme of Christmas

For the Time Being is a dramatic
poem on the Christmas theme pre-
sented without action, scenery or cos-
tumes. The poem has eight major
parts: Advent, the annunciation to
Mary; the Temptation of St. Joseph;
the Summons to the Wise Men; the
Vision of the Shepherds; the Visit to
the Manger; the Meditation of Simeon;

(Luke ii, 25-35); Herod’s Massacre
of the Innocents; and the Flight into
Egypt.

The Washington and Lee Univer-
sity Glee Club combined with the
Randolph-Macon girls’ choir to per-
form Handel’s “Messiah” Sunday af-
ternoon.

Under the direction of Randolph-
Macon’s Roger Cole, the hour-long
performance began at 5:00 p.m. before
a capacity audience in Randolph- Ma-
con's Smith Memorial Auditorium.
Asked to comment on the perform-
ance, W&L's Professor Robert Stewart
replied, “It was perhaps the cleanest
performance of the “Messiah” by the
two groups in recent years. The open-
ing chorus was particularly commend-
able and the soloists were exceptional.

Student Director Praised

He also expressed satisfaction that
the W&L Glee Club so easily adapted
themselves to another director and
praised the fine solo performance by
W&L's Dan Manson and William Su-
pon. Following the performance, the
two groups enjoyed a candlelight din-
ner prepared by the Randolph-Ma-
con component.

The Washington and Lee University
Glee Club's next performance will be
at the candlelight service this Thurs-
day night at 8:00 p.m. in the Robert

the constant attempt of Christians to

tournament often contains not only
regular debate rounds, but also)
competition in after dinner speak-

Another category sometimes includ-

nature, and finally extemporaneous
speaking, which entails quick recall
of current events. Dr. William Rey-|

the negative team of Jeff Wainscott

64 Language Sing To Be Held
Tomorrow Night In Lee Chapel

The annual Washington and Lee
Foreign Language Sing will be held
tomorrow evening in Lee Chapel. As
has been the tradition for the past
sixteen years, each language depart-

in the sing.

The French department, under the
direction of Dr. George Francis Drake,
will, in addition to their annual ver-
sion of “Ilouette” sing a number of
high spirited drinking songs. Among
these are “Boire un Petit Coup” “Au-
pres de ma Blonde” and “Cadet Rous-
selle.” The French vocalist will con-

CONTACT Plans Discussed

Last night's meeting of the IFC

There were not any of the humor-

proposed that

eomes that there were 25 occasions
last year when Townies had gone

en a destructive drinking epree in
Lexington and vicinity after attend-

ing WAL fraternity parties

This would be a safeguard for
the fraternities as a local judge
has threatened to apply the rule
af law known as: “contributing to
the delinquency of a minor,” by
serving them liquer or allowing
them to drink on the premises,
The attempt, according to the pro-
bation officer, is to avoid the
nature of the Townles after con-
suming a little liquor. I reminds

 

this reporter of the days when the
American Indian used to go ber-
serk after imbibing firewater.

The next significant note of busi-
hess was the proposal by Chuck
Griffin, Bus Committee Chairman.
to accept the new agreement made
with Pete's Taxi Co. After exten-

Tuesday Edition

Aftermath Of The Referendum

Last Wednesday’s referendum on conventional dress and
the Assimilation Committee is a thing of the past. Or is it?
The votes have been tallied to be sure, but the implications
of the vote are still in the breeze.

The Tuesday Edition was pleased, and a bit surprised, by
the outcome of the vote. We were pleased that the Assimilation
Committee, as an idea, was upheld. We were surprised that
such a large percentage of the vote (about 36 per cent to be
exact) was in favor of the “status quo” as far as the committee
or conventional dress were concerned. The important question
remains—what changes in Assimilation policy should be made?

Campus leaders have said both before and after the refer-
endum, “Some changes in policy will obviously have to be
made.” There are dangers, however, that lurk in so general an
idea of concession. We agree that the Executive Committee
and the Assimilation Committee ought to lend a receptive ear
to the desires of the student body; yet we do not feel that the
long standing high ideals of gentlemanly dress here ought to
be sacrificed simply because they have come under some criti-
cism. The report of the written suggestions on the referen-
dum are still forthcoming; however, a good guess can be made
as to the policies that will come under the most frequent attack.

First of all will be the question of “wheat jeans.” Only
a few would try to defend wheat jeans as gentlemanly dress.
They are not. The problem enters with the objection that no
one could be able to tell a student here that these particular
brand of pants are not “conventional.” The Assimilation Com-
mittee has tried all fall to explain their objection (backed by
the EC) to wheat jeans: the cut of the pants, the general
sloppy appearance of those who wear them, and the fact that
if wheat jeans are allowed, why should not blue jeans be al-
lowed also? Someone had to make a decision on this question,
and we feel that the Assimilation Committee has made a cor-
rect one. It is hard to imagine what dress at Washington and
Lee would be like if students were left entirely free to judge
for themselves what was conventional dress. Probably the
majority of students do want high standards of dress, but with-
out some sort of organ to oversee these standards, the appear-
tance of the campus would be marred by a few. We of the Tues-
day Edition, therefore, hope that wheat jeans will not be
condoned as “conventional dress.”

The basic coat and tie tradition will be safe. It is possible,
however, that some will ask that ski parkas be allowable
substitute for sports coats. Acknowledging here how warm a
parka is during the winter, the best solution is to make clear
that ski parkas are fine, as long as one goes to the small trouble
of putting a sports coat on underneath the parka. Just think
of how much warmer you'll be then!

And what about the dollar fines? Brooks Brown, present
Chairman of the Assimilation Committee, has squelched all
rumors stating that these small fines in any way enrich the com-
mittee, as a whole or as members. The object of the fines is
simply to give the committee some means of controlling the
more flagrant violators. In an attempt to reflect more the
spirit of conventional dress, the committee has not fined all
those who have appeared before it this fall—only those who
have no respect for conventional dress or are constant violators.
This policy breeds not only understanding, but it does enable
the Assimilation Committe to do an effective job on campus.

One point about assimilation policy that may come out of
the referendum, and justly so, is that of where and when con-
ventional dress should be worn. To expect it on campus at all
times is as it should be; and yet, what about town after dark,
and or Saturday afternoons. There is possibly room here to
relieve the anxiety of many students who may not have time to
change while taking a break at night or while on a weekend

date.
A Word On Contact

Our student body is going on trial in the next few months.
This trial will not, in affect, render a verdict of guilty or
innocent; however, it may render a verdict even more lasting
to this student body and to student bodies of the future.

The case in question will be the Interfraternity Council’s
proposed CONTACT Weekend. CONTACT will be an intel-
lectual symposium for this student body. It was proposed by
students. It will be run by students.

Many have said that Washington and Lee students are
completely socially oriented and have no interest outside the
classroom in anything which resembles an intellectual ex-
posure. It was for this reason that members of our faculty and
administration overwhelming approved the IFC’s idea for such
an intellectual program. When this proposal was passed, many
members of both the faculty and administration exp
a great deal of skepticism concerning our student body’s abil.
ity to actually sucessfully present and support a program of
this nature. Many still hold this skepticism.

Therefore, it will be our job to show these skeptics that
Washington and Lee students can present and support a pro-
gram such as CONTACT. Until these skeptics are convinced
that today’s W&L student is interested in more than a “five
o'clock cocktail” or a “weekend honey,” they will remain un-
willing to allow us to indulge in such luxuries as the five day
week, free study programs, and a lightened load of “busy
work.”

The burden of proof lays on our shoulders.

‘Any Number’ Passes As Mystery,
Despite Music and Trick Ending

By MAC RIVES |

There are pitfalls which one
writing for the Ringt-tum Phi learns
to expect: Phrases deleted in his
copy words changed and mis-
spelled, commas struck, semi-colons
postponed, capitals donated, pic-
tures—all of which serve to make
the contributor look even more a
novice than he might already be.
Fortunately, of course, no one but
the writer maligned cares; and the
haphazard treatment he occasionally
receives is really no more than what
he deserves for presuming to give
his opinion in the first place.

Which brings me, somewhat fal-
laciously, to Any Number Can Win,

 

a movie with virtually no preten-
sions. It is a mystery, the story of
a billion franc coup in a Cannes
casino. The characters are stock—
Jean Gabin as the two-time loser
fresh out of the can Alain Delon
as the young vopain with the span-
gled leather jacket and criminal
apprenticeship. Jeans wife wants him
to buy a restaurant on the Riviera,
but Jean says no go. He has bigger
things invisioned.
Is It Tony?

The crime, appropriately intricate,
is eventually realized only to be
frustrated by the predictable trick
ending. But during the interim be-

The Oldest Of Christmas Stories
Made New: Food For Thought

By WEB DeHOFF

And it came to pass in those days, that there went out an
advertisement from Greedius Merchantus, that all the world

should buy.

And all went to buy, every one into his chosen store.
And Joe also went up from subdivision, out of the sprawl

of suburbia, into Town, unto the store of departments, which
is called Macy’s; (because he was of*

the credit system and mailing list |
of Macy’s).

To buy with Marge his espoused
wife, being loaded with errands.

Things Were Bought

And so it was, that, while they
were there, the things were bought
which had to be given.

And they brought forth their
quick-bought presents, and wrap-
ped them in brown paper, and laid
them in a mailbox; because there
was no room for them in the Post
Office.

And there were in the some town
policemen abiding in the street,
keeping watch over the traffic by
night.

And, lo, a cynic of today came
upon them, and the fumes of Bour-
bon smelt round about him: and they
were sore angered.

“For Behold”

And the cynic said unto them,
Watch out: for behold, I see Christ-
mas crowds with great shopping lists,
which include all people.

For unto us is born this decade

money.

And suddenly there was with the

 

 

is entertained well enough. Delon is
actually not as bad at the junior
partner in the robbery. The compar-
sion which some have drawn be-
tween him and Tony Perkins isn’t
particulary apt, as Mr. Perkins dem-
onstrated in Phaedra. Not analogous
roles, to be sure, but T. P. doesn’t
merit analogies.

Gabin is equally satisfactory as
the mastermind—sauve, tought, flex-
ible. One doesn’t think him repre-
hensible, which is proper, since the
audience must be induced to sym-

succeed at all. Correction: perhaps
people don’t care that much whether
Gabin mades it or not, for he does
plain to flee the Caberra afterwards
and retire on a sheep ranch. The
charitable interpretation is that he
is kidding.

Cannes Is No Problem

Well, cheap cleverness anyway
isn’t a fault of Any Number Can
Win. There is little to distract one
from the central object of Gabin

and international trollops at poolside

nice setting for un houldup, and the
easy elegance of the gambling rooms
affords a casual additive to the

World War Makes Room
For ‘Two Women’ at WGL

By HEAD NEWMAN
Assistant Managing Editor

When Pear! Harbor was bombed in
December of 1941, many students
at Washington and Lee left to join
the armed services. As the months
went by, more and more students
left and the faculty became wor-
ried over the reduced attendance.

Several faculty members suggest-
ed that this loss of enrollment might
be hade up by admitting women to
the University. These faculty mem-
bers evidently felt that the thou-
sands of women throughout the
South who felt blighted because they
had not been allowed to attend W&L
in the past would jump at the
chance to come to Lexington and
find a suitable mate.

Faculty Split

When the faculty voted on this
issue ,the results were very inter-
esting. It seems that all non-alumni

cynic a multitude of the hurried | in the faculty, without exception,
shoppers, pushing people, and say-| yoted for the admission of women.
ing, “Glory to Givers in the highest,| On the other hand, all of the alumni

 

and in stores bargains, cheap prices
on presents.”
It Came To Pass

And it came to pass, as the shop-
pers were gone away from them in-
to the stores, the policemen said to
one another, Let us go even unto
Macy's, and see if this thing is

 

come to pass, which the cynic hath
made plain unto us.

And they came with haste, and
found Marge, and Joeshp, and the
babe lying in a manager, beauti-
fully girft-rappey for only $4.98
(plus tax).

on the faculty voted against the pro-

posal, except one. Perhays this
that four years at W&L will warp
anybody's mind.

The proposal was approved and
steps had to be taken to prepare
the campus for coeds. Rooms had to
be provided that were suitable for
women, and a Dean of Women had
to be added to the faculty.

Two Brave Souls

Applications were accepted for
the summer session of 1943, When
the final results were tabulated, it

 

was found that W&L had sold its

birthright for the admission of
two women. Actually there were a
total of twenty-five women here that
summer, but these were the only
two that came from outside of
Rockbridge County.

These two adventurous young
ladies did not waste their tuition
for the summer; by September both
were engaged to fellow students at
Washington and Lee. The first to
be married was Miss Wada Wade.
Her maid of honor was Miss Eliza-
beth Weaver, the other conspiring
coed. It is rumored that the bride-
groom suggested the playing of the
W&L Swing as the processional and
College Friendships as the recession-
al; of course, this is only hearsay.

Life on Campue

This story should make many peo-
ple reflect on just what life on cam-
pus would be like if W&L was co-
educational. It could be compared
to having nine a months SIPA con-
vention.

Those dull night during the week
could certainly be improved if you
had only to call the girls’ dorm
and tell her you would pick her up
in fifteen minutes. No longer would
you have to drive 175 miles to pick
your date up, bring her back to
Lexington, take her back to school,
and drive over the mountains again
in a sleepy daze at 2 in the morning.

Having girls on campus would
probably cause a great deal of
clumsiness on the part of the male

of the student body—an
example might be pencils and pens
dropped in classes.

 

A Reply To Saunders

 

Should John Lindsay Campaign
For The Republican Party?

Editor's note: This story was
turned in to the Ring-tum Phi as a.
letter in reply to a column in last |
Tuesday's Edition by Steve Saun-
ders. The letter appears as a column
here.
To the Editor:

Last week this newspaper printed,
an article by Mr. Steve Saunders)
extolling the virtues and bright fu-)
ture of Republican Representative
John V. Lindsay of New York.

Among other things, Mr, Saunders.
told us that Rep. Linsay “.,. achiev-|
ed national prominence...” through
his refusal to support Senator Gold-
water, the head of his party's na-|
tional ticket.

With regard to this noble gesture,
I quote Rep. Lindsay as of Jan. 24,
1964: “Whoever the Republicans
nominate is certainly deserving of
the support of all Republicans.”

Man Without a Party

It is also interesting to note that
among his profuse campaign posters,
pamphlets, ete. never once did the
word Republican appear. Gov. Rom-
ney and Senator Scott, to name but
two, vietoriously campaigned as Re-
publicans while still not embracing

Sen. Goldwater. It is only Rep. Lind-|
say who is ashamed of his party.
Finally, to paraphrase Mr. Nixon,
a man who voluntarily sits on the
sidelines during the game should
not ask to be made captain of the
team.

One of the loudest and most per-
sistent charges against Sen, Gold-
water was that he was, in Gov.
Rockfeller's phrase, “...out of the
mainstream...” of the Republican
Party. How, I asked Mr, Saunders,
do you determine whether or not a
man is in his party's “mainstream.”
The reply: “Well...his voting ree-
ord is an excellent way.” Let us

| then look at Lindsay's voting record.

Lindsay and the A.C.A. Ratings

The Americans for Constitutional
Acton, a highly conservative or-
ganization, grades all congressmen
solely on their voting record. A 100
per cent rating, then, indicates a
quite conservative position; a 10
per cent, a very liberal one, With the
same criteria applied to all con-
gresamen, these ratings obviously)
provide an objective view of their
relative conservative or liberal)
standing. The following ACA.)
figures are for the Republican mem - |

bers of the eighty seventh and
eighty eighth congresses:

The average rating was 80 per
cent. Lindsay's rating was thirty-
five per cent. One hundred seventy-
nine representatives were rated more
conservative than Lindsay; only
four more liberal.

Even the firey Silvio Conte, rep-
resentative from Massachusetts and
leader of the liberal fight in the
platform committee, rated 61 per
cent.

The Crucial Question

The important question, though, is
this: should a party nominate a man

who does not agree with the ma-
jority's thought? Mr. Saunders
reply: “No.”"—the same _ implicit

in Gov. Rockefelier's repetitive com-
ments on the subject.

It is most comforting to know,
then, that Mr. Saunders and Gov.
Rockfeller, according to their es-
poused beliefs, would never support
Lindsay for the party's leadership
since he is, as these facts prove,
definitely in the ultra left wing of
his party, and most certainly out
of its “mainstream.”

School Alumnus
Defends Frats
After Hollins Letter

Editor, Tuesday Edition
Ring-tum Phi
Lexington, Virginia.

Miss Sylvia Doughty, Editor, Hol-
lins Columns, did quite a job on the
ego of the W&L male in your Nov.
20 paper. Since she blamed the prob-
lem on the fraternity system at
W&L, I felt it was necessary to set
her straight. Fraternities have
enough problems without Sylvia
Doughty’s theory that in some man-
ner W&L students have degenerated
from knights to knaves because of
some mysterious influence of the
fraternity system at W&L.

No doubt her “lamant” was writ-
ten in the spirit of good, clean,
Hollins-type fun, but there are
enough characters running around
loose who latch on to any criticism
of fraternities, that I took advantage
of the opportunity to suggest that
fraternities be restored to their pre-
vious position of strength.

The administration and faculty are
encouraging weakening of the fra-
ternity system, and the fraternity
members themselves are playing
along unconsciously by constantly
changing (or considering changes)
the rushing system, by reducing the
utilization of the fraternity houses
through members living out, and by
failing to properly indoctrinate the
freshmen .

The new rushing system adopted
this year will in a few years serious-
ly affect 25 per cent of the chapters
at W&L. It is a poor system because
it places the initiative in the hands
of the freshmen. It will weaken fur-
ther those houses that are already
weak which is not good for the
overall fraternity organization. Cur-
rent national conditions require all
fraternities to join together to beat
off the attackers.

Saturday Classes
Re-evaluated
By Two Students

To the Editor:

Last week’s editorial in support of
Saturday classes was marked by a
complecent, inflexible outlook. The
idea of eliminating Saturday classes
was dismissed as being next to im-
possible on technical grounds, and
less than desirable for other rea-
sons, including its supposed lack of
utility for furthering academic goals.

The question is, how valid are
these arguments? First, the con-
tention that it is practically impos-
sible to reschedule classes so that
those on Saturday can be eliminated
is highly questional! Anyway, this is
a technical matter and should be
resolved by studying other schools
which have been able to “do the
impossible.”

Despite the uninformed assump-
tion that only girls’ schools which
do not have ROTC programs are
able to do without Saturday classes,
the editor might find information to
the contrary if he would look beyond
the confines of the Shenandoah Val-
ley. Secondly, the assumption that
“the change would be in allowing
uninterrupted road trips” is particu-
larly sad. Though some students
may lack the sufficient academic or
intellectual discipline to devote their
increased free time to worthwhile
pursuits, this is no valid reason,
especially at an educational institu-
tion where it is assumed that indi-
viduals are mature, to penalize those
students who might wish to spend a
little extra time studying or just
reading for pleasure.

For a University to follow poli-
cies aimed at students too irrespon-
sible to have more than a day pet
week of “free time” is to deny to
responsible students the opportunity
to further their formal education
with personal research and inquiry.
If you argue that we are being un-
realistic, we can only say that if
this is your answer, you are denying
the supposed excellence of the
Washington and Lee student body
and the high reputation of our Uni-
versity. In summary we believe that
Mr. Smith and the Tuesday Edition
of the Ring-tum Phi should drop
their esesntially negative defense of
the status quo and replace their
viewpoint with a more responsible
and creative analysis of reality

Chemistry Seminar To Feature
Phillip Mollere on Dimension

On Friday, December 18, at 5:00
p.m., the Chemistry department will
present another of its seminars. This
week’s is entitled “Projections of the
Fourth Dimension.” Philip Mollere will
give the talk.

Said Mollere, “The talk may be de-
scribed as a layman’s introduction to
the concept of four dimensional geom-
etry. It is not a rigorous mathemati-
cal analysis.”

The seminar will be preceded by tea
and cookies at 4:30 p.m.

Each week the Chemistry depart-
ment presents a seminar, though the
subjects are not necessarily confined
to chemistry. Past topics have includ-

Financial Problems

The major problem which faces
Contact is finances and this is un-
derstandable since it is in its first
year of operation. As a_ result,
Brown proposed that since the IFC
conceived Contact as a function of
the IFC, it is the fraternities’ re-

will students discover what type
of costume they are to receive.

Since the theme for the dance is
“Showboat,” the outfits will range
from facsimiles of gamblers’ outfits
to Civil War officers’ uniforms in or-
der to accommodate everyone. Dates
for the dance will not rent costumes
and are requested to wear long form-
als.

sponsibility to support it. And so,
the IFC has been asked to under-
write any deficit Contact may in-
cur. This of course presupposes that
every existing fund-raising effort
fails completely which is highly
improbable.

In order that the burden does
not fall on the IFC and conse-
quently asked that they encourage
any possible parental contribu-
tions, The larger the contributions
from the parents the less money
the students will have to pay. As
Contact has reduced its budget
drastically, Brownell is confident
that even the smallest parental
support will prove sufficient.

Brownell is quoted as saying that

dents to make a very great educa-
tional contribution to the University,
a continuing contribution if this
year’s symposium is successful.

Region Managers Named
For ’68 Mock Convention

Nine regional managers and a
financial chairman for the 1968
Mock Republican Convention have
been selected. Convention Coordi-
nators Dave Mayfield and Steve
Saunders expressed pleasure with
the calibre of the new appointees.
There were forty-nine applications
for the ten positions available. In
a joint statement, Mayfield and
Saunders noted that “very few of
those who applied were not quali-
fied to serve. It was a question of
degree of qualification, and a diffi-
cult one to answer. We picked a
first-rate group which will do a
first-rate job.”

Barry Vaught, KA sophomore, was
appointed Interim Financial Chair-
man of the convention. He is vice-
president of his class and a mem-
ber of the Assimilation Committee.

Freshmen appointed to the nine
regional manager positions are: Jon
Adams, Rod Boren, Luke Crosland,
Bob Keefe, Jimmy Madison, Joe
Matthews, Scott Snowden, Jeff
Wainscott, and Kerry Weathington.

This summer, from June 21 to
August 31, Washington and Lee
will be the site of a Summer Insti-
tute on Languages. The Institute,
which is being sponsored by the
United States Office of Education
under the National Defense Educa-
tion Act, is being directed by Dr.
L. L. Barrett, professor of romance
language at W&L. Other members
of the W&L faculty who will serve
on the staff of the Institute are Dr.
G. F. Drake, who is the assistant
director, and Dr. C. W. Barritt, who
will instruct a class in linguistics.

The Institute is being conducted
with the aspiration of raising the
standard of proficiency in the teach-
ing of French and Spanish at the
high school level in and around the
state of Virginia. For this purpose
the Institute has planned a pro-
gram which will atempt to saturate
the participants in their particular
language for the 8-week period. The
students will be orientated in French

Major Address to Examine Role
Of American Citizens Abroad

By LARRY MEEKS
Managing Editor

Col. Francis P. Miller, currently a special assistant in the
Department of State, has accepted an invitation to speak at
Washington and Lee’s CONTACT weekend, according to
chairman Blaine Brownwell. Col. Miller’s major address, en-
titled “Americans Abroad and Their Task” is tentatively set
for 7:30 p.m., Sunday March 14.

A native of Kentucky, Col.

Miller has had a distinguished

career in the Army, in government service and in various re-

ligious organizations.

He received an A.B. degree at Washington and Lee in
1914 and was Washington and Lee’s first Rhodes Scholar. As
a Rhodes Scholar he attended Oxford University and received

a B.A. degree in 1921 and an

M.A. degree in 1923.

In 1927-28 he was a student at the graduate Institute of
International Studies at Geneva Switzerland. He holds honor-
ary degrees from Centre College and from Washington and

in each language. Selection of the
participants will be made by a com-
mitte appointed to screen applica-
tions from interested high school
teachers. The committee will base
their decision upon a standard of
minimimal requirements, with the
intention of assembling a represen-
tative and felicitous cross-section
of teachers from the Virginia area.
Dr. Barrett further stated thta all
applications would be considered
without regard to race, color, creed
or national origin.

This is the first time Washington
and Lee has hosted such a program,
and this will be the first time in 3
years that such an institute has been
located in Virginia.

Dr. L. L. Barrett commenting on
the new program said, “The idea

actually originated with President)
deserves.

Cole last year and he
most of the credit for securing the
program at Washington and Lee.”
Barrett went on to explain that
he had worked with the State De-

partment of Education on numer-|
ous occasions and was asked to take |
over the program last spring. Dur-/
ing the summer Dr. Barrett visited |

several colleges throughout the

county in order to gain an idea of|

how their programs ran. Upon his
return to campus this fall, he drew
a proposed program for presenta-
tion to the government.

“Actually its quite a feather in!

our cap,” said Barrett. “The pro-
cess of election for grants of this
type program is competitive and
usually twice as many schools ap-
ply for grants as those which
receive them.”

The selection

of schools for this

type grant is made on the basis of)

the presentation made to the state
department, the insructors available
to teach the courses, and the en-
thusiasm expressed by the adminis-
tration of the school applying

can

THE RING-TUM PHI

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association
Friday Edition

 

Use the Bus Service

“Use the Bus Service” signs will soon be distributed over
the campuses of W&L, VMI, and the local girls’ schools. The
Ring-tum Phi heartily seconds this suggestion.

The Bus Service, which provides weekend transportation

for students’ dates and is sponsored by the IFC, was begun) |
on a temporary basis a few months ago. It was understandably | |
inefficient at first. Beginning with Fancy Dress, however, the},
buses will be put on a regular schedule which will not only |

provide transportation back on Saturday night for visitors
from the local girls’ schools, but will also bring them over in

the afternoon.

Such a system should certainly be a boon to the social life
at W&L where one of the most frequent complaints of those
who do not have cars is that is is just too much trouble to date.
Paying a girl’s bus ticket might prove a little more expensive
than a car pool but there are obvious compensations—phone

bills being one.

The greatest advantage to come from using the bus service

though is that it will eliminate
will it be extremely convenient

the driving hazard. Not only
to drive no further than Red

Square for a date but it will also be extremely safe. It has
been a constant source of amazement to us that despite the
distances that students drive each weekend and the conditions
under which ond over which they drive that there are still so
few serious car accidents. We can not help but believe though
that in the past few years of our relatively good driving record
that we have just been lucky. We hope to see our good record
continue, and the best way to do this is by making use of the

bus service.

We Were Wondering .. .

We were wondering if it is necessary that the stacks in the
library be closed between 5 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. every night.
We were also wondering why checking out a book is such a

complicated practice.

These practices at the library are irritating all year but
especially at this time of year when so many students are

working on research papers. If

one choses to leave his source

books in the study rooms behind the stacks, he is restricted in
the hours that he can work, and if he choses to check out all
the books that he needs, he must go through the tedious
process of filling out twice as many cards as books to be used.
There seems to be some room for improvement.

Student Opinion

 

Rigid Grading Lessens Student’s

By WARREN MONTGOMERY
Feature Editor

A fact of the recent history of
the W&L intellectual community is
the great hue and cry that arises
over the suposed
lack of scholastic
_ interest on the
part of the stu-
| dents, and it is
true to some ex-
‘tent. Many W&L
f students take lit-
tle voluntary in-

terest in their
studies — they
study because the
automatic rule

dragoons them in-
to studying. For a college of this
type, one that admits the academic
uppercrust of American high schools,
this is a curious and unfortunate

 

problem.

The faculty, which seems to be
most concerned, makes constant ef-
forts to explain this phenomenon,
but its ideas usually gravitate to
the usual whipping boy, the fra-
ternities. Certainly fraternities are
partly to blame for the student’s
avoidance of intellectual thought,
but I believe that their role has been
much over-emphasized. What the
faculty members overlook is per-
haps a prime cause for intellectual
stagnation—their own approach to
grading.

W&L’s faculty is an excellent
one; nevertheless, they perhaps go
about trying to correct student in-
tellectual apathy in the wrong way.
This age—marked by great tech-
nological advances and the con-
sequent necessity for leadership
by an educated elite, plus the in-
creasing difficulty of getting em-
ployment without superior educa-

Agent 000 Ends Squash In 007 Fashion

By BRUCE W. RIDER
Friday Columnist

Bzz. Bzz. Bzzzz.

Damn—I hope it’s a wrong num-
ber, thought British Agent 000.

P’s voice came clearly over the
intercom. “000? Come to my office
at once.”

000 put the papers on his desk in
order and filed them away. Why
would P want to see him?

P glanced up as 000 enter the of-
fice and strode up to the massive
mahogany desk.

“Sit down if you like. Go on
I won't bite you.”

With a weak grin, 000 turned
down the offered cigar and sat
looking at his left shoe, Some fool
in the tram had stepped on his
toe and ruined a good polish,

P spoke again. “000—I've got an
assignment for you.”

“Me, sir? Isn't there anyone else?
I still have some reading and filing
to do, and. ...”

“No, 000,” said P evenly, “we
want you. Matter of fact the P.M.
requested you specifically for this
assignment.”

Won't vote for him next election,
now will 1, said 000 to himself,

P lit another cigar and puffed
at 000. “Let's have a look at your

“My what, sir?”
“Your weapon. You know. Your
gun, Bang bang.”

“Oh, that. I think it's in my
desk, At least that’s where it was
the last time I looked,”

“Well, 000, just make sure you
have it for this task. You may need
it if you run into trouble.”

“How nasty.”

Behind the clouds of greenish
smoke P spoke again. “I've booked
you on a flight to Paris in an
hour. We want to locate the ene-
my's HQ and you're the man for
the job. What? HQ stands for
headquarters, 000,”

Reaching into a drawer P pulled
out a small black case. “Here.
Special Section has worked up this

little item for you. Everything's
here: Drammamine, chewing gum,
aspirin, and the like. The weather's
clear so your flight should be

 

smooth. Do try not to be ill again.”
P pressed a button on his desk

while 000 checked over his new
kit.
A slender, silvery-looking man

came in, carrying a bowler and a
black umbrella.

“Pay attention, now, 000,” said
P. “Equipment Section has de-
veloped some things for your as-
signment. Come on, let's have it.”

The equipment man first display-
ed the bowler, which was made of
steel, in case someone should crack
000 on the heard. The umbrella was
more intricate. It contained a re-
loadable smoke bomb and flare-
shooting apparatus.

“So you see, 000,” said P, “when
you reach the enemy you will open
the bumbershoot and our men will
know the location of the enemy
HQ, I mean headquarters.”

000 took the equipment. Opening
the umbrella he discovered that
it worked just like the man from
Equipment Section had described.
After the smoke cleared and the
flares were doused, P gave 000 his
plane ticket and warm good-
bye.

000 tidied up his desk and bid his
secretary farewell.

“They're sending you? How cute.”

On the plane to Paris 000 tried in
vain to recall the passwords. British
agents had special phrases to iden-
tify each other but 000 had a poor

P once had given him the words
on paper to learn and then swallow,
but 000 had gotten dreadfully sick
from the paper and had forgotten
the words anyway

In New York he'd been ap-
proached by a man in Pennsylva-
nia Station who said, “Taxi, Mis-
ter?” and 000 had spent $26.78
riding around Brooklyn before dis-
covering that this man wasn't the
right one after all.

On his most recent assignments he
had solved the problem of pass-
words altogether. At the airport or
train station he would simply go
around saying, “I'm 000. Are you
my contact?”

This time he needn't have worried

Two large yellow men met him

 

and threw him into the back of a
large yellow car.

After beating him on the bowler
to no avail they put him in a sack
and told him to keep quiet if he

id.

After what 000 considered to be
a goodly length of time the car
stopped and they all got out. 000 was
let out of the sack and he saw that
they were on a dock. He was led up
a gangplank to a sleek yacht.

000 was taken immediately to the
captain's quarters.

The door opened and 000 was face
to face with Col. Klunk, the evil
head of the crime syndicate,
SQUASH.

Col. Kluk looked at 000 with
disgust.

“Look who they sent, LOOK
WHO THEY SENT! 000. Don't
they think we're important? Aren't
we big time?”

“I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Klunk. It
really wasn't my idea.”

“That's okay, 000, Nobody's blam-
ing you. It's just the principle of
the thing.”

Col. Klunk looked sadly out over
the water. “This shoots the plan
We were going to hold a British
agent for ransom, but we can't get
anything for 000.”

000 followed Col. Klunk out to the
deck. It had begun to drizzle.

“Here,” said Klunk. “Gimmie
that damn umbrella.”

Before 000 could speak the um-
brella was snatched away and a
moment later the boat was filled
with smoke and the sky with
flares. Soon the boat was swarm-
ing with British agents and French
police. The members of SQUASH
were flattened.

000 waited for a clear day and
then flew back to London

He sat down at his desk
sighed deeply
Bzz, Bez. Bezzz. 000 hoped it would

nally sent this setter to Miss Syl-

Editor's note: Mr.

in response to an article that Miss
Doughty wrote for our paper,
which severely criticized the so-
cial life of the W&L student. We
will be happy to either print or
pass on to Mr, Gilmore any com-
ments you might like to make,
Dear Miss Doughty:

We W&L alumni received the
Ring-tum Phi two weeks late due
to the gross inefficiency of the busi-
ness operation in Lexington, so I
have just had an opportunity today
(Dec. 8) to read your inflammatory
statements about the sheep at W&L.

There is a lot of truth in your
“lament,” but in some fit of obtuse,
tortured reasoning, you criticize the
fraternity system for the activities
of the “knaves” from W&L. For
your information, it was the same
fraternity system when the “knights
from Washington Hall made their
conquests by brandishing wit, irre-
sistable charm, and perish the
thought—good form.”

It was also the same fraternity
system when your Mothers were at
Hollins in the 20's and 30's, and
the same fraternities were at W&L
as far back as 1855 when some Wa-
hoos from Charlottesville establish-
ed Phi Kappa Psi at the then Wash-
ington College, well before the “un-
civil war,” and just shortly after
Hollins began business in 1842.

The fraternity cannot, in one or

two years, re-do the initial 18 years)

of these “knaves,” or “knights's” lives
Actually, the weaking of the W&L
fraternity system in the past ten
years by various acts of omission

and commission by the W&L admin-|

tration and faculty is, in my opinion,
the basic reason the knaves
able to effect the court coup, as

you put it. In addition, many more
students now live out of fraterni-
ties in houses, apartments, rooms,

(Continued on page 4)

   

were)

tion—places great pressure on
universities, including Washing-
ton and Lee. As a result, profes-
sors try to crack down—to try to
weed out the “good student” from
the mediocre mass. They perform
this weeding operation by giving
the lowest grades possible—one or
two A’s, few B’s, and a great ma-
jority of C’s, D’s, and F’s in an
average-size class.

Failure of Tough Policy

Does this “get tough” policy fulfill
its intended purpose of causing
greater effort by the student? Not at
all; in fact, just the opposite occurs.
To illustrate the point, let us accept
two very probable assumptions: that
most students of sufficient caliber
to be admitted here have an in-
herent (if latent) intellectual curios-
ity, and that most students actually
do or will work hard.

Professors too often assume that
because students do poorly, they
are not working, but very often
they work hard and make an in-
ferior showing anyway. Why? Be-
cause a combination of both hard
work and intellectual curiosity is
necessary for a good classroom
performance. A student may stug-
le with a difficult text for hours
and learn nothing, even though
he has worked hard. His failure
to accomplish any learning is due
simply to his lack of interest.

The problem then, is to arouse
intellectual interest in the student.
Under the popular “get tough” poli-
cy, however, a sequence like the
following often occurs:

Psychology of Bad Grades

A student enters an English course
with enthusiasm and works hard
at it. However, the professor's first
test is difficult, the student makes
mistakes, and since his paper was
only 10th highest in a class of 30,
he receives a C. The students
thought process goes as follows: “I
worked hard in this course, but I got
a low grade. Obviously, I must be
basically uninterested (since I
couldn’t lack the intelligence).
Therefore, I won't work so hard as
before, since I am not interested
in English anyhow.”

Subsequent examination fiascoes,
this time caused both by the teach-
er’s “get tough” attitude and by
the student's lessened study, re-
affirm the student’s conviction that
he has no interest in English. To

‘Goldfinger’ Is
Best Bond Yet

By JAMES JENNINGS

Broads, booze, horses, planes, cars,
gold and James Bond make Gold-
finger the most popular movie of
present selection of flicks going
around the country. Goldfinger has
broken attendance records in Dal-
las, Chicago, and Danville, Virginia.
In Danville the
James Bond flick
was the highlight
of the social sea-
son. It seems that
the stud from
British Exports
has some kind of
hold on the view-
ers that were
awed by Brando
in One-Eyed Jack,
impressed by
McQueen in Mag-
nificent Seven, and bowled over by
Newman in Hud,

The Best

Goldfinger is probably the best of
the James Bond movies to date.
It is the most absurd by far and
has more smooth acting than the
other two. Bond's automobile is a big
hit as 007 is himself. He drives a
Austin-Martin that does everything
but get the girl; so, between the
driver and the car nothing is left
out. The women in this movie are
plentiful, generous and appreciative
of the talents of the patriotic civil
servant.

Oddjob stands out as a dedicated

servant to Goldfinger. With his hat
in his hand he faithfully serves
his master right to the end when he
must sacrifice his life so that Gold-
finger can succeed. This is a noble
| act which is all for nought, needless
to say.
There is no way to evaluate a
| James Bond Movie because the
| movie merely seeks to run a cool
| and absurd story on the screen with
a stud idol, good looking women,
and lots of music and technicolor.
|The movie maker pulls it off very
well in Goldfinger and rumor has it

he is making bad grades in. Other-
wise, he will have to believe that
he has an inferior intellect, and
that he will rarely do.

Psychology of Good Grades

On the other hand, another stu-
dent lucks into a good grade on
the first test. He studied the right
cold quiz, was feeling better that
morning, ete. Under the teacher’s
grading method he receives a B, or
even an A. He thinks, “Gee, I really
know that English cold. I’ve got
real talent (even genius!) in Bng-
lish. This is really a fascinating
subject—I'll have my true genius
out.”

The second student, his intellect
flattered, expands his original
curiosity in his subject and takes
a genuine interest in it. He is en-
couraged by the approving atti-
tude of his professor, who feels
that he has done his part to sep-
arate the goats from the sheep.

The point of these two examples
is this: the way to arouse a stu-
dent’s inherent, if latent, intellec-
tual curiosity is through his vani-
ty. Make him think he is good, and
he will try to be better. Make him
think he is mediocre, and he will
not care.

An Axiom

Summarizing, I offer this gen-
eral axiom: If you take two stu-
dents, originally equal in intelli-
gence, curiosity, and will to work,
and if you reward one by giving
him an A and show indifference

Waitresses and Winos
Provide Unattractive

Town Environment

By TRACY HARRINGTON

Students are too critical of Lex-
ington.

I guess we're just accustomed to
calling it drab, and colorless, and
dull, and boring. But it really isn’t.
There’s lots to amuse in little old
Lexington.

Take the waitresses in the town
restaurants. Each place has its type,
like a fraternity.
One specializes in
hairy, obese crea-
tures with high
tempers and low
LQ.’s. Here Betty
Bovine scowls and
daily,
and may = snarl
with a little en-
couragement. She
also sports a ver-
min-infested head,
and she usually
manages to scatter a little dandruff
or a few lice over your pizza. (She's
even free of social niceties, and may
burp, seratch, sneeze or cough when
serving customers.)

If you tire of fat and ill-temper-
edness, you can travel out to one
of the less popular restaurants and
get a real kick. There the girls are
Vogue-oriented. Two of them—one
with carrot-red head and skin-tight
dresses—posture and pose, smile
slightly and greet you with an air
of real gentility. Of course you have
to overlook green teeth and dirty
fingernails, but with a little imagi-
nation you can see yourself in a
posh establishment.

No Monopoly

Restaurants don't have a monopoly
on Lexington's personality.

Red Square knows Baby Marijie
and Her Fouled Mouth Three, a
group of lower Lexington children
who please the boys with bawdy
tales and four-letter exclamations.

There are a number of other
young ladies, a little older than Mar-
jie, who circulate around North
Main and whose company can make
for a diverting evening.

If you're in the mood for meatier
entertainment, a towny joint can
provide a few laughs. On a vintage
Saturday night a student can wit-
ness three fights, a couple of major
injuries, and may even be able to
win himself a black eye or a broken
arm. I remember one occasion when
I had my fingernails trimmed—with
a meat cleaver, from across a room.

Square Dance

On Friday and Saturday nights,
the hill people emerge and converge
on Stevesville for the weekly dances.
Now this is the place for real fun.
A combination of blue grass music,
hair-lipped girls, and a strong flavor
of b.o. creates an atmosphere you
just cannot forget.

Nobody can say Lexington has no
color.

lt has more old maids, more winos,

more illiterates, more bums, and
less virgins than any town its
size in the world

And, unfortunately, for nine

months of the year it has us.

W&L Loses Eighth Straight,
Play D.C. Teachers Tonight

By GUY UNANGST

Jeff Twardy may replace 6-4 Bob
Spessard as pivot man in tonight’s
game with D.C. teachers, coach
Verne Canfield said yesterday.

According to Canfield, Twardy is
the one “real jumper” on the Wash-
ington and Lee team—and tonight
the Generals will need all the
“jump” they can get.

D.C. Teachers, led by high-scor-
ing guard Tony Upson, will be the
first all-colored team to play in
Doremus. It beat W&L before
Christmas in Washington, 97-79,
dominating the backboards and hit-
ting 60 per cent from the floor.

This could very well mark W&L’s
9th straight defeat. It lost Tuesday
to Lynchburg, 87-81, in a side ef-
fect of Wayne Proffit’s debut.

Proffitt, who just enrolled at
Lynchburg, hit 10 field goals and
17 of 22 free throws for 37 points,
played fine defense and received a
standing ovation when he fouled
out with 1:14 left.

 

W&L had come from a 15-point
deficit to tie the score, 72-72, with
4:55 left. Nine straight Lynchburg
points, seven on free throws, put
the game out of reach.

Lynchburg had led at the half,
46-32, despite Steve Sweitzer’s 18
points. Sweitzer finished with 27.

Canfield said his team was not
discouraged, although things aren't
likely to get brighter in the imme-
diate future. Monday the Generals
must play Pfeiffer, which upset
powerful Hampden-Sydney by 18
points. Hampden-Sydney has twice
beaten W&L by large margins.

Then tomorrow night the Gener-
als will travel to Richmond for an
eight o’clock game with RPI. Wé&L
could do alright in that one.

Long-range plans seem a _ bit
brighter. W&L has a chance to pick
up three transfer students, all of
whom played under Canfield at
Groverton High School in Alexan-
dria. Canfield is also after 65 po-
tential freshmen—three of whom
are All-Staters—whom he says meet

 

Ring-tum Phi Sports Staff Gives Awards
Name Canfield As “Optimist of the Year”

By R-TP Sports Staff |
There comes a time each year
when sports pages throughout the
country make their annual awards.
And that time is now upon us. Who)
are we to break with this worthy |
and assinine tradition?
Actually we're about a week late|
with these, but what’s a week, give |
or take a few months, to the Ring- |
tum Phi. So, leave us give out these
awards as voted by the interepid|
Friday Ring-tum Phi sports staff.
The first annual R-TP sports page |
award for the best example of
courage displayed during the pre-
ceding year goes to Oregon State.
Their fine example of courage in
showing up for the Rose Bowl
should stand as a model for us all. |
Technically, Oregon State should|
be considered ineligible since their |
action took place on January first)
of this year, but their worthiness
for this award was considered to)
be so great that the technicallity |
was overlooked.
The award for optimist of the year
strikes a little bit closer to home.
After much careful deliberation, the
R-TP sports staff decided to give
the award to Verne Canfield for)
accepting the job as basketball
coach at Washington and Lee.

It was much easier to decide who
deserved the good sportsmanship
of the year award. There can be but
one contender for this one, the New
York Yankees for their fine example

|

 

of good sportsmanship in firing Yogi
Berra for not winning the World
Series.

By an overwhelming vote , the
R-T Phi sports staff selected Sonny
Liston’s shoulder for the sports in-
jury of the year.

For the greatest display of hustle
in the sports world during this past
year, the R-TP has decided to give
Atlanta, Georgia, a special award...
the keys to the city of Milwaukee.

Without much discussion, it was
decided to give the award for most
needless sports event of the year
to the National Football League, for
its continuing presentation of the
Apathy Bowl between the also-rans.

The award for quickest strike-it-
rich deal in sports was this year
split two ways. To Joe Namath of
the University of Alabama and John
Huarte of Notre Dame, both of
whom are $400,000 properties of
the New York Jets (rhymes with
Mets).

It was a difficult choice to pick the
winner of the sports-organization of
the year award. Finally it was de-
cided to pick SPEPOOJCA for all
it has done for the Jennings Cup
competition.

And finally it comes time to pick
our candidate for Sportsman of the
Year. In recognition of their cour-
age in standing up to the abuses of
pro football clubs for signing play-
ers while they still have eligibility,
the award goes jointly to Pete Roe-
zell and Joe Foss. Vive le dollar’

 

Kell To Compete In Richmond As Winter Track Begins

By LUKE CROSLAND

Practice sessions for the Wash-
ington and Lee winter track team
have already begun and if exper-
ience means much, this should be a
good one. This year’s squad, accord-|
ing to coach Norm Lord, boasts sev-|
eral experienced runners as well as)
several promising freshmen. The
team's first meet is scheduled for
February 6 at the VMI relays.

One of the backbones of this year’s
squad is co-captain Chris Kell, a
letterman last year. Kell, incidentlly,
will get in some preliminary work
this weekend when he competes in
the Chesterfield J.C. meet in Rich-
mond.

Kell was the only W&L team
member to reveive an invitation to
compete in the invitational. He will
take part in the 50 yard dash

Although no other members of |
the team received invitations to the
meet, Coach Lord emphasized that
there are several other fine track-
sters on this year’s team capable
of fine performances
Kilpatrick Heads Distance Runners

 

Dave

Co-captain Andy Kilpatrick heads

|a strong group of distance and mid-

dle distance runners. Because of his
speed Kilpatrick may see some ac-
tion in the middle distances, al-
though as of now he is slated to
see action only in the distance runs.

Riff O'Connor and Charlie Head
also provide strength in the mile. In
the middle distance races (880 yards
and 500 yards), Bingham and Jim
Thompson will get a lot of work.
Meyers and John Graham
head the jumps (broad and triple)
and pole vault respectively

Frosh Look Good

Many promising freshmen will aid
this year’s team. George Parker, Bob
Stack, Williams and John Lawrence

Frosh In Sixth
Straight Loss
To Lynchburg

Washington and Lee’s freshmen
basketball team went down to its
sixth straight defeat without a vic-
tory Wednesday as it lost to the
Lynchburg College JV’s, 74-54.

The W&L frosh played Lynch-
burg on even terms for much of
the early part of the game, but
by the end of the first half had
fallen behind 38-26. Lynchburg
outscored the Brigaders 36-28 in the
final stanza to chalk up their vic-
tory.

Jim Madison led all scorers in
the game picking up 17 for W&L.
He was followed by Corbert Bryant
with 12 for W&L. Brown led Lynch-
burg scorers with 16. Coffee chipped
in with 13.

Freshman coach Joe Lyles re-
mains pessimistic on the season’s
outlook. He said, “It’s questionable
whether we'll win a game all year.”
He again pointed to the squad’s lack
of experience, with only three play-
ers having any previous high school
experience.

Lyles praised his players for their
determination and drive. He said,
“They realize they aren’t the best,
but they also realize someone’s got
to represent the freshman class.”
He added that there are some play-
ers in the freshman class who should
be out for basketball but aren’t for
various reasons.

The W&L frosh face their next
competition next Thursday night
when they play Bridgewater JV’s
there. Bridgewater already holds
one victory over W&L.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

 

(Continued from page 2)

and beginning 5-6 years ago the
freshmen have been required to eat
in the Freshman Dining Hall, so it
is impossible to equate the decline
and fall of the W&lL male with the
fraternity in a way that is critical
of fraternities.

The actual fact is that the frater-
nity has considerably less effective
guidance, if you will—on the typi-
cal W&L student than in the past.
If anything, this situation calls for
the return of the fraternity system
to its former status. Strengthen the
fraternities and you'll “strengthen”
the W&L male! There is a decided
lack of guidance and control at W&L
because the administration has seen
fit to reduce the influence of the
fraternities.

In order not to think that W&L
types are unusual, however, you
have indicated that the knaves are
everywhere, even in Charlottesville.
They’ve all read “The Group”;
blame it on Vassar. Don’t blame it
on fraternities! At Harvard, where
NO fraternities confuse the egg-
heads, you'll recall the headlines
a couple of years ago about the
sexual activities during “visiting
hours” in the dormitories. They said
there were even some girls involved
too, but I doubt it.

So say what you want about
W&L knaves but don’t blame it
on fraternities which are already
having enough trouble with left-
ist faculty transfers from Kenyon,
Princeton, and Antioch as well as

the NAACP.
I suggest that you and each of

Letters To The Editor . . .

   

 

 

 

your readers write President Cole
of W&L and tell him that you be-
lieve that if all W&L fraternity
members and pledges were required
to eat and live in the fraternity
houses, there would be a return to
knighthood in Lexington.

Something is needed at W&L.
My opinion is that they should
return to the conditions where the
fraternities did exert more guid-
ance, control and education over
its members, particularly the
freshmen.

Let’s go Hollins...Promote the
W&L fraternity system, first, by
printing this letter in your news-
paper ;second by writing President
Cole. I would appreciate it if you’d
send me a copy of this issue of

This little thesis is addressed to
some of the professors here who are
notoriously hard graders (and many
more are than think they are). It
does not pretend to lay bare the
entire problem of apathy and low
grades, but it certainly points out a
significant aspect of them. You prob-
ably see no connection between the
interest shown by your students and
the grades you give. But the two

are insoluably and directly linked;
intellectual interest varies directly
with grade level.

Some semester, why don’t you
experiment with giving more high
grades (A’s and B’s) and fewer
low ones, without necessarily reduc-
ing the work load, however. It cer-
tainly will not hurt you, and you
might drastically increase your effec-
tiveness as a teacher.

YOUR FAIR LADY has a way of turning into Cinderella-At-The-

Ball over the Christmas holidays. What with the stepped-up pace
of formal entertaining, parties, dinners, balls, and theater parties,
you, as Prince-Escort, will be called upon to look your elegant best.
In fact, quite aside from the Christmas season, your undergraduate
years will probably afford you more frequent opportunities to don

on an engraved invitation implies a personal
obligation to look your absolute best. A vest,

Either the V-shaped with points, or the tradi-

of the newest trends in men’s formalwear is the
“modernized Edwardian” vest in straight cut
with dull satin facing on the lapels. Whatever

‘Compete in Speech Contest
Annual Event Last Night

The speech classes of Washing-

' ton and Lee and VMI participated in

the annual speech night at VMI last
evening. Following this
up, last night, beth schools sent mem-

i bers of their Argumentative Speech

classes to speak and refute several
topics.

On Wednesday night VMI and
WEL each presented two prepared
speeches and one impromptu speech
with humor as the theme of the
evening. For Washington and Lee,
Walt Bennett spoke on “Wlegance
in Politics” and Joe Bear followed
with a satirical talk on French Pres-
ident Charles de Gaulle. W&L's im-
promptu speaker was Roland Corn-
ing, who gave a profound lecture
on “Why VMI Should Accept Co-
eds and Have a Co-educational Ca-
det Corps.”

In last night's program both schools
presented three speeches which were
in turn refuted by students from the
opposing team. From WAL Jim De

a dynamic leader with a great sense
of humor. His career began in the
thirties, the same time as Glen Mil-
ler’s. On one occasion his career
was almost nipped in the bud when
gangsters invaded the night club
where McKinley was playing and
sent a stray bullet his way. The bul-
let hit McKinley in the leg.

During World War Il McKinley,
already a friend of Miller, was a
sergeant under Miller, who was a
major. After the War McKinley was
a logical choice to take over the
Glenn Miller Orchestra.

In reply to a rumor that the
Lettermen would not appear at the
concert Saturday night, Dance Board
vice president Jim Crothers stated
flatly that the Lettermen will be in
Doremus Gym for the concert Sat-
urday afternoon at two o'clock.

 

 

Mr. Mattingly in Hospital,
Hoped To Return Shortly

Last Sunday the University
Treasurer and Secretary Eari S.
Mattingly was hospitalized with
minor heart trouble. He is present-
ly at Stonewall Jackson Memorial
hospital where he will rest until
Friday when, his doctor said, he
will probably go home.

Mr. Mattingly became student
assistant in the Treasurer's office in
1917. In 1920 he was appointed
Registrar, and in 1940 he became
Secretary and Treasurer.

During his long stay in Lexing-
ton with Washington and Lee, Mr.
Mattingly has been very active in
the local hospital and R .E. Lee
Memorial Church.

The hospital listed his condition
as “very satisfactory.”

An all free-Hungarian company, the
Hungarian Ballet Bihari now touring
the United States for the second time,
will make an appearance here next
Wednesday night, Jan. 13, at Waddell
School. The performance at 8:15 p.m.,
' will be the second presentation of the
| Rockbridge Concert-Theater Series.

The troupe, which stars the renown-
ed Nora Kovach and Istan Rabovsky,
| is unusual in that all its members, in-
cluding seven musicians, have defect-
ed from Communist-controlled Hun-
gary. It is also the only ensemble to
combine strictly folk elements—native
dances, authentic costumes and gypsy
orchestra—with the professionalism of
classical ballet.

The New York Times recently said
of the company’s performance: “Dazzl-
ing technique that continually churned
up applause.”

Kovach and Rabovsky, in private
life husband and wife, were both
born in Hungary and met while stu-
dents at the Budapest Opera Ballet.
Their promise was so great that they
were selected by the Soviet baller-
ina, Ulaneva, to continue their stud-
ies with the Leningrad Ballet Com-
pany. Subsequently, they became

| spected organization before return-
| ing to their native Hungary, as full-
fledged stars.

in entertainment very close to their

The seven musicians chosen for

as a Consultant to the Secretary
of State.

In 1955 he received a Guggenheim
Fellowship to study the interaction
press and government in Washing-
ton, and in 1957-58, he spent nearly
a year traveling around the world
on an Eisenhower Fellowship.

Mr. Cater is the author, or co-
author of three books: Power in
Washington, written in 1963 while he
was a Fellow at Wesleyan Center
for Advanced Studies; The Fourth
Branch of Government, written in
1959; and Ethics in a Business So-
ciety co-authored by him and Mar-
quis Childs.

In 1961 he was awarded a special
Ceorge Polk Memorial Award “for
bringing clarity to the complexities
of big government.”

In commenting on the topic
chosen, Brownell said that Mr.
Cater will attempt to deal with
increasing sensitivity of our na-
tional government to all the inter-
related affairs of national devel-
opment, and the increasing re-
sponse of Washington to national
problems.

“He plans a broad treatment of
increasing federal responsibility
it means for our federal system, and
what it means for the American fu-
ture,” Brownell added.

Mr. Cater is also expected to
make an attempt to illustrate this
development by differentiating be-
tween the New Freedom, the New
Deal and The Great Society.

Last week it was announced by
Brownell that Col. Francis P. Miller,
a Special assistant in the Department
of State, also has accepted an invita-
tion to speak at the Contact weekend.

Col. Miller’s address will be, said
Brownell, “Americans Abroad and
Their Task.” Col. Miller is a 1914 grad-
uate of Washington and Lee and was
W&L’s first Rhodes Scholar.

The Phantom”
Strikes Again

By FRANK L. FAIRCHILD, JR.

Condemning the “hypocrisy and
stagnation” of the W&L student
bedy, a phantom writer has recently
barraged tthe bulletin board and the
Ring-tum Phi with a series of pro-
test notices. A similar phantom ini-
tiated a campaign last November
with a letter addressed to the edi-
tors of the Ring-tum Phi under the
pseudonym “Oliver Wordwork.”
Since the author refused to reveal
his true identity, the letter was
withheld from publication.

In the first epistle, the Angry
Young Man (Woodwork) castigated
the “currupt image of the pseudo-
stud.” He accused the student body
of leading a “purposeless existence”
lacking the “moral principals (sic.)
which here seem useless.” However,
the phantom is not without hope. He
feels that “the whole lousy social
system” can be changed, if the stu-
dents will “stand up and say and
do what they want to.”

Failing to receive the attention of
the student body through the Ring-
tum Phi, the anonymous writer
seems to have turned to the bulle-
tin board. In his most recent notice,
the critic continues to bemoan the
“outdated” social system of W&L
Indirectly criticizing the Ring-tum
Phi for not printing (his) unsigned
letters, he accused the schools “es-
tablished leaders” of erasing indi-
vidualism. Quick to point out that
he is not endorsing riots or “even
free love,” the phantom asserts that
his ultimate purpose in writing is to
encourage the students to “speak
out and demand fair opportunity to
express and maintain their individ-
ualiem,”

A Modest Proposal

Enthusiasm has begun to build up a little early for the
1968 Mock Convention. The organization which has
mushroomed for “pre-convention” planning during the
last few months is nothing short of fantastic. Now it’s
about time to sit back for a minute and evaluate the pre-
convention program which began last fall with the modest
intention of providing for “interim coordination” between
the 1964 convention and the 1968 affair.

One interim coordinator turned into two, and they
both needed assistants. Then, of course, there had to be
regional managers and financial managers, and more as-
sistants. The end of it is that the mock convention, four
years ahead of time, possesses an organization which will
have to be called a bureaucracy if it is padded with just
one more layer of appointments. In such an organiza-
tion—especially since it has no concrete or inherited duties
and hence cannot move by intertia—there is always the
danger that each man will expect everybody else to do all
the work.

Aside from the danger of the mere size of this organ-
ization, there is the much greater possibility that enthus-
iasm for the mock convention may well burn itself out
long before 1968, at the rate things are going now. Last
year’s steering cmmittee found it very difficult to keep
the student body interested in the convention for one
year; it is hard to see how the present interim coordina-
tors are going to prevent people from getting a little
bored with the convention unless they slow down fast.
After all, four year’s work is a lot of preparation for a
two-day convention.

There are three long years before any appreciable
results from all the work under the interim coordinators
will be noticable. This is a long period for a student organ-
ization to remain in the planning stage. It will be difficult,
but by no means impossible, for the profits of so long
planning to be realized.

If the two interim coordinators are able to overcome
these problems the 1968 mock convention has a head
start on any past W&L convention and possibly on any
mock convention in the country. These gentlemen have
generated a huge responsibility for themselves, one which
is much more than an affair of “interim coordination.”
They have begun to lay the foundation for the conven-
tion itself. The coordinators—Dave Mayfield and Steve
Saunders—are men of great talent and initiative, and
if they can keep up the fast pace they have set for them-
selves, there is no question that the 1968 convention
will be the best one in history. But Mayfield and Saunders
must be careful that in their planning they do not neglect
the new problems which have arisen out of the very fact
of such an early and such a fast start.

 

 

The Iron Is Hot

The announced plan of the administration to put the
University Supply Store back on campus in the “old
Co-op” building behind the library is the answer to a very
old complaint from the student body. Having the Co-op
back on campus will be a great convenence to everybody,
in addition to pleasing those utilitarians among us who
think it’s about time the empty “old Co-op” was put to
some use. But we think the administration is ing a
mistake in planning to move the ROTC department
into the rear of the student union building after it is
vacated by the present Co-op.

Since the Co-op is to move out of the student union,
this vacancy would seem, to provide the ideal moment to
answer another very old complaint of the student body:
that the facilities of the student union are inadequate.
The location of the present Co-op is the only one which
could be almost immediately, and relatively inexpensively,
turned into a real student union—i.ec., one with some
manner of recreational facilities other than a television.
Because this location is actually a part of the building
which presently houses the entire “student union,” there
would be no question of having to build a completely
new student union building. It would be a simple matter
to install pool tables, ping-pong tables, a juke box, and
other recreational equipment or even study carrels.

Non-fraternity students have been clamoring for a
student union for years. If they were finally given one,
probably it would not become the most-frequented place
in Lexington. Nevertheless, those who would use a stu-
dent union deserve some attention, There just isn’t any
place for them to go now. And there is no doubr that if
the student union were to be equipped with recreational
facilities, freshmen and some fraternity men would like to
use it also.

This step would not provide any palace of wonders, to
be sure, but it seems to be the only possibility of improv-
ing student union facilities for the near future, Surely
some other location could be found for the ROTC
outfit than the only one now available for the student
union. The students of Washington and Lee, particularly
the increasing percentage who do not belong to a frater-
nity, deserve something more than the town of Lexington
offers.

 

 

By C. W. MORRISON
History Department

In his article in the January 8
issue of the Ring-tum Phi Warren
Montgomery put his fingers on a
very real problem in the educa-
tion process at Washington and
Lee, the relationship between string-
ent grading and intellectual apathy
on the part of the students. Stringent
grading does frequently lead to stu-
dent apathy, perhaps through some
such process as Mr. Montgomery
describes. And yet I cannot agree
with his proposed solution that pro-
fessors should use good grades as
an incentive for students.

One difficulty with the solution
is immediately obvious. Human be-
ings have different psychological
makeups, one student’s incentive is
not another’s. The B that inspires
one student to new prodigies leaves
another complacent. Should the pro-
fessor try to take account of indi-
vidual psychological differences?
Even supposing that he could do this
successfully, this policy points to-
ward a reductio ad absurdum where
two students of equal performance
but different psychological needs
would be given different grades to
increase their interest and make
both work harder.

But Mr. Montgomery evidently
does not intend any such injustice.
His conclusion suggests that he wants
professors to give higher grades gen-
erally rather than on the basis of
individual need. Presumably, most of

Professor Replies to Montgomery's Article

Grades Measure Achievement ©
Should Not Become Incentive |

the students would then show great-
er interest in the course and conse-
quently do better work. With a
student body as grade oriented as
that of Washington and Lee, this is
a questionable presumption. Even
if it were not, however, the propos-
al would be wrong because it is
based upon a misconception of grad-

ing.

Although the professor has a re-
sponsibility to try to encourage rath-
er than discourage his students, he
should not use grades for this pur-
pose. The purpose of grades is total-
ly unrelated to incentive, however
great the consequences of grades
are upon incentive. The grade is
not, as Mr. Montgomery would have
it, a “reward,” the professor’s vote
of confidence in the intelligence, cur-
iosity, and will to work of the stu-
dent. The grade cannot and should
not measure these factors directly.
It measures instead the student’s
achievement, according to certain
standards determined by the pro-
fessor.

Ideally, the student earns his grade
by demonstrating his ability to
think in terms of the particular sub-
ject matter of the course. Many stu-
dents do not understand this fun-
damental distinction between in-
put and output. They think that a
certain input, some combination of
work, interest, and _ intelligence,
should guarantee them a good grade.
But it does not. They are rated on
output or performance.

Cinema Columnist Turns Literary Critic

 

 

Since some students do manage to
make their imput combination pro-
duce an output which meets the
professor’s standards for good work,
do succeed in that difficult and mys-
terious process which we call getting
an education, it would be paently un-
just, as well as unfair to the class
as a whole, to rate them with those
who do not.

It seems to me that the problem
of student apathy resulting from
stringent grading arises largely out
of the student’s overvaluation of
grades, coupled with their misun-
derstanding of what the grade rep-
resents. Too many students strive
primarily for grades which they mis-
interpret as representing this pro-
fessor’s attitude toward their efforts
and talents. They try to discover
precisely what it is that their pro-
fessor “wants” so that they can win
his approval by giving it to him. But
what the professor really wants is
not a student working to please
him but one trying to acquire an
understanding of his course. This
involves seeking knowledge rather
than grades.

It is difficult to believe that profes-
sors can bribe students into seeking
knowledge with good grades. What
is required is not the professor's
acquiescence in the student's over-
valuation of grades but their insist-
ence that the quest for grades be
subordinated to the quest for knowl-
edge.

popular slapstick of 1913-14. His des-
criptions of these early studios are
as evocative as those of his home.
The Sennett studio “had small lum-
ber-yards and junk-yards, and
abandoned-looking stores that front-
ed the road.” The Keystone Studio
was “a dilapidated affair with a
green fence around it, one hundred
and fifty feet square.

Then, in 1915, after some 15 pic-

a giant, an idol. It is at this point
that the narrative of the book be-

loses the charmingly warm accounts
of his young life in another world

‘Ariel’ Features Mahan Award Poetry,

Short Stories By Ledbetter

By HEAD NEWMAN
Feature Editor

Ariel's autumn issue features the
latest trends in experimental fiction
by campus writers. The poetry in
the issue, according to co-editor
Grayson Powell, is “a nice balance of
erotic and sedate poetry,” which is
not far from the truth, The short
stories, two of them to be exact,
are interesting and a short review of
Aidous Huxley's recent essay, “Lit-
erature and Science,” closes out the
issue .

This year's first Ariel leads off with
a semi-satirie brain twister by Reb-
ert Mac Rives. a
Kappa Sig senior.
Glatteisgefhar is a
“stream -oaf -consci-
ousness” type
short story that
directs its wit al-
ternately on
American travel-
ers in Europe, col-
lege poker play-
ers, basketball ace
Joe Tutt, and
amateur film erit-

 

Newman

ies.
Foreword with LaRue
The foreword to the story, written
supposedly by Lache LaRue, (notice

how well this goes with Rives), gives
a hint to the author’s own disinctive
style: “incoherent in parts, naive in
others...what one must describe
as highly disjointed short stories,
completely deficient in classical vir-
tues of balance and restraint, and,
en the whole little more than trans-
parent disguises of his own control-
led adventures.” At any rate, we
may not always keep up with
Glatteisgefahr's X-KE, but we en-
joy the chase anyway.

Jim Ledbetter, co-editer, submits
the second piece of experimental fie-
tion, The Vision, Ledbetter has crea-
ed an introspective, rather poetic
character named Jeff Logan, who
ends up talking to Mr, Magoo on a
park bench. No, Logan is not one
af those homosexuals, but he does
seem to take on a real life in The
Vision. Ledbetter’s style is enter-
taining and he shows talent at char-
acterization.

“Birth and Death”

The central poetic contribution to
this issue of Ariel is the work of
Liewllyn Smith. The three poems in-
eluded won the 1964 Mahan Award
for Smith. The poet seems obsessed
with the ideas of birth and death,
and images such as “burial in moth-

and Rives

er” and “halfway to birth” give pun-
gency to his work. “A Circumcision”
is Smith's most compact and success-
ful poem of the three printed, speak-
ing ritualistically of birth and death.

The Erotic Side

Two poems by Hollins junior Joni
Raffeld and one by Hollin’s gradu-
ate student Louis Milton Bourne de-
velop relatively quiet, reflective
themes in comparison to the delight-
fully playful and sensuous “Yawned
and Pillowheaded” by Tobe Glasser.
Tobe is actually not the poet, ac-
cording to rumor, and the poem is
by an anonymous Sweet Briar sen-
ior. “Pillowheaded” is rich in imag-
ery and suggestive alliteration, per-
fect fireside reading for a warm date

The final selection is a review of
Aldous Huxley's “Literature and
Science” by W&L junior 8. F. Par-
ham. Parham quickly seans the basic
tenets of the essays and ends by
repeating Gertrude Stein's criticiem
of Huxley's inorganic view of lil-
erature,

The fall edition of Ariel is well
worth the 75 cents per copy that
it now sells for at the library, Co-op.
Book Shop, and Commons. We will
all look forward to the winter edi-
tion, which reportedely will be com-
pletely devoted to satire.

  

After Good Start
A gain A Decline

By LAMAR LAMB

Tuesday Columnist
After an auspicious beginning
this year, the Executive Committee
has slowly declin-
ed into what it
has been in former
years. Once again,
few students dis-
cuss issues of
campus politics
because _ they
aren’t aware of
exactly what is
going on. Now
perhaps, it is be-
cause most stu-
dents don’t take
time to try to find out what the
Executive Committee is doing.
Nevertheless the EC has done little
to positively present for debate or
thought any realm of campus life.
Most members of the EC take ser-
iousily their duty to preserve the
traditions and supervise the student
government at Washington and Lee.
But most of the members of the EC
don’t recognize that a necessary part
of that duty is periodically question-
ing the student government to see
if it is meeting contemporary needs,
and questioning traditions ‘to see if
they are being effectively used in
the improvement of the modern
student generation and just pre-

served for their own sake.

The error most members of the EC
make, at least as long as I have
been here, is not one of intention
or laziness. It is, rather, one of at-
titude. Because they realize that
they have a great deal of power
and, thus, responsibility, they usual-
ly are willing to sacrifice a great
deal of time and effort to do what
they see as their duty. But because
they spend so much time thinking
about the honor system or some of
the various traditions we have, they
tend to lose sight of the real purpose
and ultimate justification for these
things.

While I was on the EC, I noticed
in myself and others the tendency
to forget that the purpose of the
Honor System was to preserve
freedom and not just to protect old
ways. When a group of people,
such as the EC, work long and
hard to apply a system to a stu-
dent body, there is a tendency to
think in terms of that system, and
not of the student body. So, when
questions of innovation or appli-
cation come up, it is easy to think
about what will best preserve
“The System,” and not how it will
most aid the student body.

Furthermore, because most mem-
bers of the EC are acutely sensitive
about their supposed duty to pre-
serve any and all traditions, they
tend to regard any suggested inno-
vation with hostility, just because it
is new. Somehow, anything new is
a challenge to an established way
which our leaders are supposed to
defend. That is why we rarely see
innovations coming from the EC.
Any changes in our student govern-
ment have usually come from either
the student body itself, or occasion-
ally, from the administration. And,
because neither the regular students
nor the administration are nearly as
concerned with student government
as is the EC, we rarely see any in-
novation, or, indeed, any question-
ing at all.

The ironic part of this whole prob-
lem is that of the nature of tra-
ditien itself. Since we are merely
students, and since we are closely
acquainted with Washington and
Lee for only a very few years, we
don't really know what things were
like even ten years ago, Certainly,
we ean't know the original purpose
of a long-established system

We don't know for instance,
when or for what reasons, con-
ventional dress as a system or hon-
or as a system were established
here. All we are given is an es-
tablished way of doing things by
the immediately preceeding stu-
dent generation—a way which has
been perhaps greatly distorted and
perverted through the years. Yet
we revere this system as good be-
cause it is old and was established
by the people who went before us.

Perhaps an innovater such as Lee
would be greatly disappointed by
what he would find teday at Wash-
ington and Lee. Perhaps we have
taken good ideas from people such
as Lee and thought only of the sys-
tem established and net the reagons
why it was established. I we have
done that, then we have perverted
the system and rendered it harm-
ful instead of useful.

I don't know if this is what has
happened at Washington and Lee
My point is that no one else knows
either, Our leaders have not ques-
tioned the possibility of this. Ne
one has studied the past te find out
why our traditions got started. Per.
haps if we did study the past we
would find that what nobility can

Team Effort Spurs Victory

Taking a 2-2 record into Tarhell territory yesterday, W&L’s
swimming team downed the Deacons of WakeForest, 53-45 to
push the Generals above the .500 mark for the season.

The charges of Coach Norris Eastman blasted Wake For-
est in the opening medley relay and were never seriously

threatened throughout the remainder of the meet. Bill Wild-
*rick followed with a first in the

200-yard freestyle with freshman
Tom Edwards placing third. Skip
Chase and Gary Bokinsky finished
second and third in the 50-yard
free as did their teammates George
Bokinsky and Kester Denman in
the 200-yard individual medley.

Depth Helps To Win

Depth proved the Generals long
suit again as diver Rich Stevens
and Noel Clinnard placed second
and third respectively as did Bill
Clay and Howard Busse in the fol-
lowing 200-yard butterfly. The Dea-
cons saw their charge of five con-

secutive firsts collapse in the face
of W&L’s rally which captured
the next three events.

Leading the Generals’ comeback

was co-captain Andy Broaddus who
touched out freshman Nelson Head
in a one-two finish for W&L in the
| 200-yard backstroke. Next came Ned
Lawrence and Edwards who swept
the 500 freestyle followed by fel-
low freshman Denman who captured
first in the 200-yard breaststroke.
Swimming unofficially Chase, Wild-
rick, Joe Huston and Taylor finished
first in the final 400-yard freestyle
relay, thus rounding out a good day
for W&L swimming.

The swimmers next meet is this
Saturday against subsidized and
powerful East Carolina at 2 p.m.

Notice

No change in registration, it has
been announced by Dean Pusey’s of-

To the Editor:
I question the conclusion that “C.

W. M.” reaches in his Friday-edition

'| editorial (December 11, 1964).

His contention that the votes for
proposals 1, 2, and 3 (supporting the
convention of Conevntional Dress)

|| should “strengthen its enforcement” is

illogical. Sixty-five per cent of the
votes indicated—at minimum—a desire
for “some change in the present op-
eration of the committee” (i.e. the en-
forcement), and 40 per cent voted for
the abolishment of the committee.

I also question the method of assess- |

ing the results of the referendum. The
Assimilation Committee should not be
in the position of interpreting criticisms
of itself which threaten its future ex-
istence. The Executive Council called
for the referendum, administered it,
and should interpret its results.
Sincerely yours,
ED DODD, JR.
(Editor’s Note: Mr. Dodd is mistaken

in his statement that the Executive

| Committee called for the referendum.
|The EC administered the referendum

after a group of students called for a
vote by petition.)

his films and how he made them. He
speaks only briefly about his films;
“The intellectualising of line and
and space, composition, tempo, etc.
is all very well, but it has little to
do with acting, and is liable to fall
into an arid dogma. Simplicity of ap-
proach is always best ...Time saving
in films is still the basic virtue.
Both Eisenstein and Griffith knew
it. Quick cutting and dissolving from
one scene to another are the dynam-
ies of film technique...I am sur-
prised ‘that some critics say that my
camera technique is old-fashioned,
that I have not kept up with the
times. What times? My technique is
the outcome of thinking for myself,
of my own logic and approach; it
must not be borrowed from what
others are doing. If in art one must
keep up with the times, then Rem-
brandt would be a back number
compared with Van Gogh.”

As a film critic, these are the es-
sential points I look for in Chaplin’s
text. He is saying that he is a
natural. He builds his movie brick

Caro. Jones explained “Why the
United States Should Encourage a
Split Between Red China and Russia.”
Caro constructively presented some
reasons why “VMI Should Establish a
Fraternity System.”

In argument to the three VMI
speeches, Sam Frazier explained the
disadvantages of public works as an
answer to unemployment; Dave Mar-
chese showed the cadets why the W&L
athletic program is far superior to
their own; and Malcolm Morris con-
cluded the program by refuting the
VMI claim that France is no longer
a great country.

scriptions of who he knows and
where he goes. Yet these extrava-
gances are permissable in light of
his frightening childhood as re-
counted above.

Of all the people he mentions,
three are significantly absent, these
being Buster Keaton (a Limelight
eo-star), Stan Laurel (a former
companion in England) and Harry
Langdon. But then, no other living
comedian is ever mentioned, either,
as if he paid no attention to his
fellow actors. He cannot be envious,
for he is clearly superior to all of
them in anybody’s mind. He seems
to be discreetly ignoring his contem-
poraries.

He speaks regrettably about his
first marriage to Mildred Harris, and
with warm affection about his pres-
ent marriage to Ona O’Neill, whom
he married when she was 19 and
he was 50. He speaks frankly about
his paternity suit with Joan Barry
and of his political harrassment in
this country, but they are obviously

Aside from ‘this, My Autobiogra-
phy is a fine and often astounding
book. He has a self-educated love
of words which makes them used
for beauty as for precision. There
is his introspective philosophy which
injures many of his oldest fans, but
provides us with many interesting
epigrams worth remembering. Albove
all, it bears the indelible stamp of
Charles Chaplin and this alone may
make it one of the few enriching

‘CLUB &

CAMPUS
FASHIONS

 

BY 0. E. SCHOEFFLER, esauire’s Fashion Director

Tomorrow’s forecast could read “Below-freezing temperatures, and
snow turning to sleet late in the afternoon.” No doubt about it,
winter is well on its way. And no self-respecting college man wants
to be caught looking through the glass darkly when the big freeze
hits. So, a few fashion tips on your cold-weather wardrobe are in
order. Let’s take a quick run-down on the trends we outerwear for

the months ahead.

THE THIN RED LINE plummets toward zero,

but you'll be snug in your campus tow coat—the
cold-weather cover-all. This new “tops-every-
thing” coat is a lineal descendant of the “Ski
Look.” Its basically bulky, masculine lines are
combined with feather-light weight. The tow
coat is readily identifiable by its length, which
is short—at most, 88”—breaking just above the
knee. All-wool or polyester cotton fabrics,
usually in a twill or poplin weave, are the most
popular in both single and double breasted
styles. Color preferences range from tan
through dark blue, black, and Loden green.

 

THE BIG NEWS IS THE BIG S-T-R-E-T-C-H in all kinds of fabrics,
which along with the “Ski Look,” are creating a major revolution
in sportswear. One-way S-T-R-E-T-C-H is the horizontal give-and-
take found in the new ski-inspired jackets. In general, jackets tend
toward greater length this year in both belt and zipper front styles.
Their added elasticity affords plenty of extra shoulder room. Blue,
black, brown and natural tan are the dominant colors. Ski jackets
feature concealed hoods which roll into the collar. Quilted fabrics of
nylon or polyester cottons continue the popular trend in diagonal
and oblong patterns. Professional type stretch ski pants, under-
stated in dark grey, dark blue, and black, are slimmer and trimmer,
maintaining the tapered look, along with greater ease and comfort

at points of stress.

SOUND THE TRUMPETS for the big swing back to leather. Leather
sport coats and jackets as well as longer coats in brushed suede and
grained leather are definitely in. Leather accessories are big too:
bindings on collars, closures, button-holes and sleeves add a dis-
tinetive and practical touch. For the more conservative—and for
the more formal oceasion—woolen top coats in a raglan sleeve,
natural-shoulder, single-breasted bold new Herringbone are getting

| the nod. The Herringbone measures about an inch wide and is made
| of black and white or grey coarse yarns. Traditional campus styling

includes flapped pockets and a fly front. And, of course, the fleece-
type camel hair coat remains a campus classic.

 

THIS SIDE OF PARADISE the well-dressed col-
lege man will be properly hatted against win-
ter’s icy fury. The “suede swinger” constructed
on a firm yet flexible nylon frame, is made of
velvety suedes and brushed leathers in natural

shades to coordinate with all kinds of leather
and textured sportswear fabrics. A small crown, a narrow brim,
and a snap-band complete the picture.

THE CALL OF THE WILD comes through loud
and clear in the HOOT BOOT. Great for foot-
ball games and trudging through midwinter
slush, the HOOT BOOT is an example of the
ideal marriage of fashion and function. This
2-eyelet demi-boot has a shorter rise than last
year’s models, pointed up by a turnback welt
seam. Unlined or—for the cold-weather campus
~—lined with fleece or shearling, the HOOT
BOOT features grained, plain or brushed leath-
ers, with leather or rubber sole. Soft, subtle

 

heather mixtures of HOOT Hose are emphasized by their fleecy
finish. They are the answer to the perennial campus demand for

practical, easy-care hose.

That's it for the latest word on outerwear. Next month, in plenty
of time to prepare you for the up-coming whirl of holiday celebra-
tions, we'll take a close look at the formalwear scene. See you then.

most recent hits ha sbeen their re-

the millions.

Joe and Eddie began singing to-|

test and won. Afterwards they began
performing at sorority and fraterni-
ty parties at the University of Cali-
fornia.

Again through the urging of their |
high school director, they auditioned |
for a San Francisco television pro-
gram. They were so successful that
they were immediately signed on
for two weeks at a local night club,
the Crescent—an engagement which
was later extended for eight more
weeks.

Since then, they have appeared

a tight schedule of college concerts.

Some of the other songs which
have made them popular are “Didn’t|
It Rain,” “Shenandoah,” “Gonna
Build a Mountain,” and “Gonna Be!
Singing in That Land.”

One of the best known and most
popular of the big name bands, the
Glenn Miller Orchestra, will appear
for the Fancy Dress Ball Friday
night, January 29, from 9-1. Original-
ly founded prior to World War II by
Glenn Miller, the Band is now direct-
ed by Ray McKinley, a close friend
of Miller’s. During World War II Me-
Kinley was a sergeant under Miller,
who was a major. After the war when
Miller was killed, McKinley was the
logical choice to take over the orches-
tra.

ance. The orchestra was recently fea-

Since 1963 their records have been
consistently at the top of the hit
charts. “Where or When,” “Come
Back Silly Girl,” “The Way You
Look Tonight,” and “That’s My De-
sire” are among their most popular.

Their albums have been equally
successful, including ones such as
“Once Upon a Time,” “A Song For
Young Love,” “The Lettermen in
Concert,” and “College Standards.”

The Lettermen—Tony Butala, Jim
Pike, and Bob Engemann—had been
group vocalists in quartets and trios
for some time before they came to-
gether. Jim and Bob had been
friends at Bringham Young Univer-
sity. When Jim and Tony discovered
that their voices went well together,
Jim remembered Bob’s singing tal-
ent, and he was called in, and the
Lettermen were formed.

They were an immediate success.
Their first engagement was at the
Crescendo in Hollywood—the night
club in which Eddy and Joe also
launched their career. This was fol-
lowed by an appearance at the Pa-
ladium, and from then on they have
toured night clubs all over the coun-
try from Las Vegas to Washington,
D.C., to Pittsburgh to San Fran-
cisco. Recently they gave a concert
in the famous Hollywood Bowl.

Television audiences have heard
and seen them on many programs
during the past few years, includ-
ing the Ed Sullivan, Jack Benny,
Steve Allen, and Tonight shows. Red
Skelton was so impressed that he
had them back three times. Many
other entertainers agree with come-
dian George Burns that “the Letter-
men’s sound and performance will
send them through the roof of show
business.”

College audiences agree, too; the
Lettermen have given over 350 col-
lege concerts and being asked
back for more.

Part of the Lettermen’s style is
their attitude that they enter-
tainers well vocal group.
All of them do solos, since they be-
lieve that this makes for a more in-
teresting Their night club acts
have been known to include comedy,
vocal impressions, and instrumentals,
as well as songs

According to their fans, of course,
the Lettermen style really lies in the

Comments on Contact

The projected IFC sponsored CONTACT Weekend has
received favorable comment from many quarters as a student
endeavor to promote intellectual achievement. Some of the
most significant comment has come from several of the guests
that have been invited, but because of previous arrangements
will not be able to attend the Weekend.

The following quotes are an example of the comment and
encouragement that have been received by Chairman Blaine
Brownell of the CONTACT Steering Committee:

“Clearly, this will be a student-speaker forum quite out
of the ordinary, I only wish it were possible for me to be pres-
ent during the sessions this March...I hope you and your
associates ... will accept my best wishes for a succesful year

of CONTACT.”

NORMAN COUSINS, Editor
The Saturday Review.

*

“The CONTACT symposium .

*

. . which you have dis-

cussed with me, promises to be exceptionally useful and inter-
esting. The year’s careful planning which will have gone into
it should ensure the high standard of content, participants, and
organization for which you and your colleagues have so con-
scientiously striven. I wish you all success in your work.

*

DEAN ACHESON
*

“T certainly agree with Dean Acheson that this unusual
and greatly needed program should prove exceedingly worth-
while. All those who helped bring it into being are to be con-
gratulated on their sound and imaginative approach. It is sure

to be a stimulating experience .

.. | wish you a highly success-

ful beginning for this fine endeavor.”
DAVID ROCKEFELLER, President
The Chase Manhattan Bank

*

*

“Tt sounds like a most stimulating pprogram, and I am truly
sorry that I cannot accept your most gracious invitation.”
JUSTICE ARTHUR GOLDBERG
United States Supreme Court

*

*

In addition to these written comments CONTACT has re-

ceived, is a call from ADLAI

STEVENSON ’s personal sec-

retary assuring the Steering Committee that “the Ambassador
thought highly of the goals and organization of CONTACT,
and would come if it were not for the heavy demands of the

U.N. Security Council during the monh of March.”

*

*

The contact Weekend promises to be a worthy intellectual
endeavor. The work and planning that has gone, and is going
into the Weekend assures that it will be successful from the
viewpoint of planning, but it can only be truly successful with
full student support and participation.

By BRUCE W. RIDER
I have just slid from the innards of
my piggy bank six dimes and three
nickels, which combine to make the
seventy-five cents necessary for the

procuring of one copy of Ariel,
Washington and Lee’s foremost

magazine of student literary endea-
vor. Having read Ariel through and
through I will provide you, the
reader(s) with some jolly thoughts
concerning same.

(Just because the Tuesday Ring-
tum Phi people made mention of
Ariel in their Tuesday—or was it
Wednesday—edition of this week
is no reason for me not to tackle
the subject. We of the Friday staff
don’t talk to that Tuesday bunch
anyway and we certainly don’t read
their newspaper.)

Allow me to state first of all,
proximally and for the most part as
we say in Philosophy 275, that I
like the color of the cover. A truly
great shade of yellow, a veritable
golden sun-drenched literary cover.
I do wish they had used some sort
of transparent ink instead of that
heavy black stuff for listing the title
on the cover—I had a devil of a
time trying to read what was going
on underneath. I was really getting
interested in what Pro. was saying

to Mira. and what Ari. said when he
came bursting in on them. And in
the thick of things Mira. had to fall
asleep. It looked like they all were
having themselves quite a little time
there.

The two illustrations were really
magnificient. The inside front cover
is a close-up of a tiny section of
Van Gogh's Sunflowers, and the back
inside cover is a photograph of a
coward eating a lemon.

Turning now to the more literary
aspects of Ariel, I should like to
point out that in listing the staff
on the first page, all the names come
out to the end of the line, which
is one hell of an accomplishment.
Good work men.

Incidentally, I liked the stories
and other stuff, but found some of
the poetry to be a little, well, dirty.
Perhaps the poets are trying to
qualify for the big time: the South-
ern Collegian.

The best writing, of course, was
the shirt ad on the back cover. Talk
about your clean-cut style, mighty
metaphors and socking  similies.
Whoo boy.

Other features which endear this
issue of Ariel to the reader are its
nice size—it fit well into the hand—

Assistant Professor of
Political Science

One of American conservatism’s
most frequently-voiced complaints
against reform liberalism is that the
latter’s plans usually bring about
“unintended consequences.” Thus
Professor Warren Nutter recently
noted in an address at Washington
and Lee that urban renewal pro-
grams destroy more housing units
than they replace, thus forcing
people to double up and exacerbating
the social problems caused by con-
gestion. Milton Friedman, another
conservative economist (or “liberal”
if you prefer), has been most effec-
tive in cataloguing the undesirable,
unintended consequences of many
of the specific programs which liber-
als have gotten through Congress.
And Senator Goldwater himself has
frequently urged that when changes
are proposed the burden of proof
should be on the proponents of
change ,who must demonstrate in
addition that the means they employ
will not bring abount unintended
consequences.

Homework Undone

In a word, the concept of “unin-
tended consequences” is a favorite
of American conservatives, and yet
most of them appear to have over-
looked the probable consequences
of the kind of Goldwater defeat that
virtually every informed observer
was predicting. The reasons for this
are not entirely clear. A few con-
servatives, perhaps, were pure
ideologues (whether classical liberal
or neo-conservative) and uninterest-
ed either in the future of the Repub-
lican Party or in the future of the
two party system ;a few, perhaps
possessed a kind of political death
wish ;but most, it seems to me,
simply failed to do their homework.

Knockout Blow

What are the probable conse-
quences of Goldwater's massive
failure and, more to the point, how
many of them were predictable
before the campaign got under way?
Within the Republican Party, of
course, the likely consequences is
a marked revulsion against those
“responsible” for the debacle. Such
a reaction is both traditional and
understandable. The point, how-
ever, is that by supporting Gold-
water in 1964 the conservatives,
whose power had always stemmed
from their stragetic position in the
Republican Party (although not ex-
clusively so) and in Congress—not
from numbers—placed their best
weapons in grave jeopardy and at
poor odds.

Look at from a slightly different
standpoint, the November election

 

 

also delivered a knockout blow to

Unintended Consequences
Of Goldwater’s Candidacy

“Goldwaterism,” however one wishes
to define that term. If this phenom-
enon reappears at all it will almost
certainly be in a much altered form.

Conservative Victories

ered a whole series of substantive
victories which conservatives had
been winning over the years. Among
such victories, according to Will-

Hank Williams’ Biography
Subject Of Good Flick For
Country And Western Fans

By JAMES JENNINGS

In To Kill a Mocking Bird, Scout
talks of bringing Boo Radley into
the limelight and says that if Boo
is brought out it will be like killing
a mockingbird. Your Cheating Heart
deals with the same kind of thing
only the mockingbird is Hank Wil-
liams, who in the movie is brought
into the light and killed.

Hank Williams, who has been
dead for over ten years stands as
the outstanding figure in Country
and Western Music. His songs are
sung every Saturday night over
WSM, and periodically a wave of
Hank Williams memorial albums hits
the market. This man still has fans
everywhere and Your Cheating
Heart will probably bring on another
wave of Williams’ memorials, for
Country and Western fans are among
the most loyal to their idols, and
will never let their man go as long
as there is a record to be heard.

Your Cheating Heart is handicap-
ped by the fact that much of Hank
Williams’ life cannot be disclosed if
he is to remain a popular figure in
the city as well as the country.
However, fear of success, his desire
to just live as he pleases, and his
love for down home music. George
Hamilton does a commendable job
portraying Hank Williams and at
times even resembles the Alabama
boy.

The movie leads us to believe
that Hank’s wife drove him to his
aleoholic state which brought death
and that it was she who killed the
mockingbird by trying to make him
sophisticated. There is probably some
truth in this, but Hank Williams
loved the spotlight and his fear was
of losing it, something which is only
intimated in the movie.

Your Cheating Heart is a good flick
even if you do not like Hank’s type
of music. It is in line with many
biographical flicks that have come
out, but it has a better script than
most, and far better acting than just
about al lof them. “The good Lord
willing and if the creek don’t rise”
you ought to go see it.

Fact and Fiction of Interfraternity Snowball Fight

Fact

By JIM AWAD
War Correspondent

The usual serenity of Lexington
was shattered this week as W&L
students had their final fling before
entering that horrible exam period.
It was a typical Monday afternoon;
the students were cither busy pre-
paring to meet their creator the
following week or recuperating from
the previous weekend. With snow
still on the ground, the DU’s and
Kappa Sigs indulged themselves in
a small snowball skirmish

But the skirmish developed into
an idea. The enemies decided to
unite and launch surprise attacks
on a number of unsuspecting houses.
SPE was the first target; “Operation
Surprise” had begun. There being
too few people in the SPE house

for a good fight, a few windows were |
broken and the force moved on down |

the street to the Sigma Chi House

Here too, most of the members
had dispersed to lab, library,
apartment. Resistance by the few
remaining Sigma Chi's was short-
lived and futile, and Sigma Chi suf-
fered casualties amounting to
windew panes. “Operation Surprise”
was a succem

Massive Retaliation
Unbeknown to the DU's and Kap-

sik

pa Sigs, however, the battle was
far from finished. At 7:00 p.m., the
thoroughly inflamed Sigma Chi's

and SPE's gathered before the SPE
house for “Operation Retaliation.”
They were joined there by some
FLJI'S from next door. The leaders
gave the word, and around 150 stu-

denta moved silently toward the
DU house
All was quiet at the DU house at

 

or’

been finished some time before, and next tried to drive the attackers,
off with a barrage of coke bottles, |

the DU’s still in the house were set-
thing down to their regular study
routine. Then suddenly, unexpect-
edly, all hell broke loose. The front
yard was filled with screaming at-
tackers. A barrage of snow and ice
went smashing through the most
vunerable front windows. The raid-
ers quickly removed the window
screens from the windows that had
them, and a fresh set of panes were
destroyed.

As a couple of Lexington squad
cars stood helplessly by, the DU's
tried in vain to fight back. An at-
tempt to rally out the front door
resulted in the DU front hall being
raked with snaw balls. The DU's

=—

—

but the only effect of this tactic was
to provide the raiders with fresh, and
much more effective, ammunition.
Someone even threw a chair down
from the third floor.

After the annihilation of the DU
house, the strike force moved on
Kappa Sigma. The Kappa Sigs were
forewarned, however, and were able
}to push the attackers out of range
of the house before too many win-
dows could be trashed.

The Sigma Chi's SPE’S, and FIJI's
next retired to their houses to pre-

pare for a counter-counter-attack
The SPE’s barricaded their win-

 

dows with bandstands, and the Sig-

 

ma Chi's shoveled away all the
snow in the vicinity of their house.

Further bloodshed was avoided,
however, by the Hill, whose benign
influence made both sides see the
wisdom of an armistice—at least
until Fancy Dress is over.

Some had gone to bed early.

Outside the house, a blanket of

Generals Lose 12 Straight
Seek Win Here Tonight

By GUY UNANGST

Washington and Lee’s basketball losing streak is reaching
record-making proportions—but it could end tonight.

Last night’s 87-63 defeat by Bridgewater is W&L’s 12th
*non-win” of the season, and 13th in succession.

The all-time General futility record
game of the 1957-58 season through*————

the first 15 games of the following
year, before W&L finally beat Ran-
dolph-Macon by six points in the
season finale.

The whole disaster began March 1,
1958, in Dom Flora’s final game.
Flora, with 2,310 points holds the
school’s career scoring record, but
he couldn’t stop Villanova. The Wild-
cats started the 16-game streak, 71-
46..

Tonight W&L gets a shot at No.
14—or No. 1—against North Car-
olina Wesleyan here. The Methodist
school is also having a bad year, and
lost to Lynchburg College before
Lynchburg had Wayne Proffit and
Ronnie Pugh, who combined for 57
points as Lynchburg edged W&L by
six. Game time is 8:30.

Both Jeff Twardy and Larry Per-
rault are unlikely to play, Twardy
because of a twisted knee, Perrault
a sprained ankle

One Win in 23 Tries

If it weren’t for a lapse late last
season, when W&L beat RPI, that
record would have been broken long
ago. The Generals have lost 22 of
their last 23 games.

Still, it’s only the school’s third
best losing streak. From the fall of
1951 through the winter of 1953,
W&L lost 15 straight. The 1957-59
streak, however, had the benefit of
what may well have been W&L’s
worst loss—to Virginia Tech by
105-24.

Freshman guard Perrault, lately
a starter, missed Monday’s Pfeiffer
game because of a Naval Reserve
meeting .He’d missed so many they
said they’d draft him if he didn’t go.

For a change, Monday’s 81-69 loss
can’t be laid to fouls and rebounds
True, W&L fouled 25 times, but no
one fouled out and Pfeiffer made
only 21 one-pointers. W&L scored
almost as many, 19 in 21 attempts,
and out rebounded the Falcons, 46-
44, a truly unique experience.

The problem was a 25 per cent
first half shooting performance. W&L
hit only 10 of 40, fell 10 points back,
and never could catch up. In all, it
missed an even dozen shots from
directly under the basket.

Sweitzer Leads Scorers

Latest statistics, through Monday’s
game, show Steve Sweitzer still
leading team scorers. He’s averag-
ing 12.6 points a game to lead Dick
Livingston (12.3) and Fred Mindel
(11.7).

Sweitzer also leads the team with
a 50.5 accuracy mark, although Min-
del leads from the foul line with a
78.6 percentage on 33 of 42 free
throws. Bob Spessard leads re-
bounders with 9.9 per game.

W&L opponents, however, con-
tinue to make all this academic.
They're averaging 95.5 points a game.

Frosh Lose To Bridgewater

Washington and Lee’s freshman
basketball team kept its perfect
record intact yesterday as they lost|
to the Bridgewater College JV’s in
a game there by an 86-62 score.
W&L is now 0-7.

Bridgewater jumped off to a quick |
lead carly in the game and never |
were in any trouble. They took a}
48-23 lead with them into the dress-
ing room after the first half.

The second half featured a W&L
comeback, but it was the old story
of too little too late. Bridgewater
was outscored by Washington and
Lee 39-38 making the final score
86-62.

John Hulsizer led General scorers
in the game as he came up with 15.
Jim Madison chipped in with 13
and Bill Rassmussen added 10.
Leading all scorers was Bridge-

A batch of W&L swimming rec-
ords should fall tomorrow as the
powerful East Carolina tankmen
invade the Doremus pool.

That was the prediction of coach
Norris Eastman, who described
the Carolinians as “the best we'll
face all year.” The Greenville, N. C.,
school, which is a traditional swim-
ming power, went on from a 57-38
win over the Generals last year to
take second in the NCAA College
Division finals.

Their strong competiton
push the W&L swimmers to their
best times of the season, Eastman
said. The meet is set to begin at
2:00.

Steve Sweitzer maintains a nar-|
row lead of just eight points in the}
scoring race among W&L basketball |
players through last Monday's loss

Sweitzer has scored 137 points for
an everage of 12.5 per game. He
is followed closely by senior cap-
tain Dick Livingston with 129 points
and an average of 11.7 and by Fred
Mindel with 127 points for an 11.6
average.

Livingston was the big gainer in
the last week, getting 34 against
D.C. Teachers and another 16
against Pfeiffer. This pushed him

ders, and Bob Spessard, as well as
Mindel in the scoring race.

Washington and Lee's varsity
wrestling squad will go after its
fourth win of the season tonight as
they grapple Hampden-Sydney. The
meet is due to get underway at 7
p.m. at Doremus Gym.

W&L prospects for an outstanding
season have received a setback from
injuries and academics, according to
coach Dick Miller. Tonight’s meet
will be the first for the Generals
since before Christmas holidays when
they lost to West Virginia. The

Bowling Tops
I-M Activity

By JOHN BEAGLE

Due to exams, this has been a
slim week in intramurals. About the
only thing happening was bowling
on Tuesday night. Sigma Nu defeated
DU by forfeit, NFU upset defending
champs Kappa Sig, 3-1, and Phi
Kap beat PEP, 4-0.

To all those interested in hand-
ball, there will be a summary after
exams with the favorites heading
into the finals.

Phi Kap Leads Overall

At the halfway point in the intra-
mural season, Phi Kap leads the
standings with 495 points, followed
by SAE at 463 and ZBT with 461. It
looks like any one of these three
could be the overall winner.

None of these three are strong in
handball, but both SAE and ZBT
should make the basketball finals.
All three should also make the
bowling finals. Look for a real fight
all the way to the end.

In the standings for the Intercol-
legiate Trophy, unofficially Delt has
regained the top it had held over
the last six years, except for the
last year when it came in second.
Pick Delt to win this race with no
trouble.

Strictly predicting, the race for the
Grand Athletic Championship will
again be tight this year. Delt and
Phi Kap have the best chance and
ZBT should be rated as the best
dark-house. Indeed the second se-
mester will see some stern competi-
tion among the fraternities for the
top prizes.

Students Can Bowl In ACU Championships

Would you like to compete for

ment?

You don't have to be particularly
brawny. Bowling, bridge, billiards,
chess and table tennis now rate
national tournaments at the college
level under the auspices of the
Association of College Unions, In-
ternational. All of them are classed
as ‘minor’ sports on the physical
education agenda, but are practiced 15
by thousands more students than

the ‘major’ sports.

ACU Rules

To compete, students must be
amateurs and also sign an affida-.
vit to the effect that since Sept. 1,
1962 they have conducted them-
selves in accordance with ACU
feomtations pertaining to amateur-

m.

The amateur provision is deemed
to have been violated if a student
participates in any type of league
or tournament where money is
awarded under any condition.
Other conduct which would make
a student ineligible for ACU com-
petition includes competing under
an assumed name; accepting finan-

cial aid, other than that adminis-

tered through his school, due to his
skill in a particular game; coach-
ing for money; signing a pro-
fessional contract in any sport;
accepting money from any profes-
roup or commercial
or personal endorse-

In bowling at least, it is consid

ered possible that any future ad-

mission of tenpins into the Olympic

games might depend on furnishing

collegiate bowlers adhering to the

wre such as those now enforced

Hawkins On Repercussion Of Goldwater’s Loss |

(Continued from page 2)

moore Kendall, a leading neo-conser-
ative political scientist, were the re-
strictive immigration laws, the refus-
al to evpand public power, the suc-
cessful defense of the House Com-
mittee on Nn-American Activities,
the relatively loose income tax laws,
and a minimum of federal aid to ed-
ucation. One should probably also in-
clude medicare and the heretofore
largely successful defense of the
strong committee, weak party sys-
tem in Congress.

All of these conservative victores
have been placed in the gravest peril
bv the Johnson landside, not only
because the liberals can claim some
kind of a mandate for liberalism but
also because the new Congressional
line-up includes scarcely a corporal’s
guard of conservatives. The loss of
key committee positions is also per-
tinent here.

Blind Conservatives

Moreover the conservatives have
continued to play directly into the
liberals’ hands in an almost comic
manner. For example, one of con-
servatism’s best arguments against
liberal majoritarianism is that the
latter’s assumptions about majority
mandates cannot be adequately sup-
ported. But Senator Goldwater has|
claimed time and again that his 27
million votes are “conservative”
voes, thus inviting, if not forcing,
the counterclaim that Johnson's 43
million votes are “liberal” ones.

Another matter of interest to some

 

people calling themselves conserva-
tives is the fact that the civil rights |
movement (considered generally) |
has been sustained almost entirely |
by judicial and executive power—|
not legislative—and that there has|
never been a clear expression of |
national suppor for it. The problem |
of the lack of legislative support)
was met prior to November 3, and
the problem of a national “mandate”

was met on that date.

Still another serious loss for con-
servatism stems from the fact that
during 1964 a  disproportionately
large number of new _ voters
registered Democratic. It is true, of
course, that more new voters had
been registering Democratic than
Republican in any case, but the evi-
dence suggests that in 1964 this
tendency was accelerated. For a
party still suffering from the enor-
mous disproportion that developed
during the depression such a ten-
dency raises the gloomiest of pros-
pects.

Other conservatives and/or Re-
publican losses include the enormous
reshuffling of state legislatures,
which is doubly important in view

Miller and is now directed by his

Friday Edition

But That Was Yesterday...

And it came to pass early in the morning of the last day of
the semester, there arose a multitude smiting their books and
wailing. And there was much weeping and gnashing of teeth,
for the day of judgment was at hand and they were sore afraid.

And at the last hour there came among them one known as
the instructor, he of the diabolical smile, and passed papers
among them and went upon his way.

And many and varied were the answers which were given,
for some of his teachings had fallen among fertile minds, others
had fallen among the fallows, while still others had fallen flat.
And some there were who wrote for one hour, others for two,
but some turned away sorrowful. And many of these offered
up a little “bull” in hopes of pacifying the instructor, . .. .

But that was yesterday.

Today is Friday, the beginning of Fancy Dress Weekend.
Today marks the 50th anniversary of the initiation of the
weekend which was begun by the university librarian, Miss
Annie Jo White in 1907. Although the weekend has a back-
ground and reputation surpassed by few college dance sets,
and although it requires great effort to match with reality the
reputation which the weekend has acquired, we feel safe in
saying here, at W&L, we have this weekend, Fancy Dress, a
collection of talent that is unsurpassed by any other college

dance set in the nation.

Consider the fantastic variety of music represented by the
various groups that are entertaining here this weekend: dance
music, Glenn Miller Orchestra;
and Eddie; popular, mood music, The Lettermen; ballads and
blues, Tom Pasle (performing during the concert intermis-
sion) ; rock and roll “juking’’ music, Ambassadors, Vibrations,
Thornton Sisters, Rufus Thomas, and Corvettes, etc.

Consider the careful planning that has been done by Dick
Kreitler and his vice-presidents in decorating, renting costumes,
publicizing the event, and co-ordinating activities in order to

bring this weekend about.

Small wonder that this weekend shows potential of being
the best ever. Exams have been breathing down our necks,

but that was yesterday.

A Voice From the Past Tells Us How

 

Fancy Dress Can Be A Social Disaster

(Ed. Note—This column, written
two years ago by Sandy Fenn,
is being reproduced in this Fancy
Dress issue. If any reader identi-
fies with Fenn, to you our sin-
cerest condolences.)

For some it was the leading col-
legiate social event in the South, but
for me it was just another social dis-
aster. You see, I had this perfectly |
wild and gorgeous date coming in
from the North and all. I had given
her the big pitch one night when I
was slightly ripped, and had allowed
as how Fancy Dress was the greatest
small college weekend any girl
could ever hope to attend. Boy, that
brought her ears up just like a
blasted Doberman Pinscher, because
she was a bit of a social climber.
In fact, if you looked at it perfectly
objectively you'd have to admit she
could outelimb one of these skinny
little natives out in the Pacific who
scurry up palm trees to shake out)
coconuts and stuff like that.

 

Anyway, she was supposed to |

call me Friday afternoon and tell |

me how the devil she was get- |
ting from Washington to Lexington

so I could meet her. Well. I sat
there all afternoon waiting for
her to call or something, but
she didn't. All I could think of
was that I was missing the cock-
tail party with the Brothers Four
and drinking sours, By the time
she finally did call at six o'clock
I was sure missing the sours and
the Brothers Four a whole lot more

the history of his own life—and the life of his times that has
become forever inseparable from his achievements. It was a full,
rich and inspiring one over decades, but surely it reached its

while she was on that thing.

Anyway, I tried to play it cool
and didn’t bother to mention just
how much I hated her at that mo-
ment. Instead I told her “gosh,
wasn't it awful for her to ride the
bus,” and “wow, wasn't it wonder-
ful that she was finally here,”
which it wasn't. Then I went to get

she announced that her costume
was strangling her. Well, I couldn’t
try to argue that with her, be-
cause it was pretty obvious not
only that it was strangling her
but also where it was strangling
her. So we left, and went back to
try to berrow some clothes to go
to the combo party in.

That effort pretty successfully fin-
ished the weekend for both of us
because there wasn’t anyone around
quite her size. And after seeing her
in that Cleopatra outfit I could easily
understand how such a thing could
be possible. Anyway, she spent the
rest of that night, and most of the
next day, sulking around in her
room and calling me every two and
a half seconds to find out where her
bag was. Cripes, you’d have thought

I was hiding it from her or some-
thing.

Finally Saturday afternoon she
got real good and mad, walked
right down to the hound station in
her one fine dress, and took the
bus back to Washington. Some
weekend, man was it ever great.
Still, I couldn’t really blame her
for for not wanting to go around
all weekend in the same dress.
Therefore, just to show her I have
no hard feelings after all this time,
I've invited her down to Fancy
Dress again, And if the same thing
should happen again, at least I'll
be prepared. She doesn’t know it
yet, but I sent off and, in keeping
with this year’s theme, ordered
seven bunny outfits for her—each
about thirty sizes too small.

Generals ‘Defeat Wesleyan for First Win

Varsity Subs To Play As Team
Members, Schedule Not Yet Set

By LOCK HANDLEY

The 1964-1965 freshman basketball team, one of the most
consistently outclassed aggregations to represent W&L in any
sport in recent years, is no more.

Joe Lyles, their coach, said of them after they dropped
their sixth straight game to the Lynchburg JV’s on January

6th,

“They realize they’re not the best, but they also realize

that someone has to represent the*—

freshmen class.”

Since then, the freshmen have
picked up another loss (to Bridge-
water JV’s, by an 86-62 score), and
coach Lyles and varsity coach Verne
Canfield have thought it over and
decided that somebody else should
do the representing.

So when practice resumes after
Fancy Dress, the former freshmen
team will be replaced by a junior
varsity squad made up of the more
experienced members of the old
team and some of the varsity players
who have not been seeing action.

The main purpose of this move,
besides providing better representa-
tion for the school, is to give more
playing experience to the younger
members of the varsity squad. A
look at the statistics shows five
players who have been scoring few-
er than five points a game, some of
whom would obviously benefit from
getting to play more regularly.

According to coach Canfield, the
change has been in the works for
some time. If next year’s crop of
freshmen live up to the expectations
raised by his recent recruiting drive,
he said, the teams should return to
their normal status next season.

Schedule To Be Set

Details on the new team
to be worked out after Coach Lyles

ing trip. These include the exact
composition of the new squad, the
arrangement of a practice

Yale Interested
In Coach Mac
As New Coach

Head coach Lee McLaughlin of
the General football team reported-
ly is one of three leading candidates
for the head coaching job at Yale,
according to a story carried Wednes-
day by the New York Times.

When reached for comment yes-
terday, Coach Mac said he hadn't
heard anything from Yale. He added,
“If that’s so they ought to tell me
about it.”

Yale has been looking for a new
coach since John Pont resigned the
job last week to take over as head
coach
Times, the other leading candidates
along with McLaughlin are Ben
Martin, head coach at the Air Force|
Academy, and Joe Paterno, an as-|
sistant coach at Penn State.

The Times also reported that Yale)
athletic director DeLaney Kiphuth|
has reactivated a committee of sev-
en which was first formed before)
Pont was selected two years ago.
Coach McLaughlin said that he
the committee
and Kiphuth two years ago befor«
they hired Pont. He added that “it
was a very pleasant trip.”

He didn’t close the door to
possibility that he might accept the
job at Yale if it were offered. He

did say, however, “I'm happy where
I am.”
Kiphuth told the Times that he

hoped he would be able te announce
a new head coach for Yale by the

end of the week.
McLaughlin first came to Wash-
| ington and Lee for the 1957 season,

when his team was 0-8. His best
teams have ben 1960, '61, and ‘62.

Noted Journalist To Address CONTACT

 

After Heinzerling Resigns

Last Monday’s regular EC meeting
reached decisions regarding a new
representative to that group from the
Freshman Law Class, an audititing of
the budgets and accounts of the vari-
ous university organizations and clubs,
and a follow-up discussion of the re-
sults of a recent student body refer-
endum on the role of the Assimilation
Committee in university life.

EC President Jim Kulp announced
last night that Peter Martone, a new
student from Norfolk, was elected to

 

 

 

Town Problem
May Require
Closed Parties

Dean of Students Edward Atwood
warned the Interfraternity Coun-
cil Monday night that continued
trouble between Buena Vista and
Lexington high school students
and the individual fraternities could
lead the school organizations into
serious trouble.

Atwood reported that several in-
cidents of violence had been re-
ported over the Fancy Dress Week-
end. Atwood stated that the fra-
ternities were not responsible for
the actions but the admittance of
teenagers into frat parties could lead
to serious charges against them for

 

serving alcohol to minors. This pen-
alty could bring immediate closing |
of those houses involved.

In an interview with the Ring- —
Phi IFC president Steve Hibbard
stated that this is becoming an in-
creasingly difficult problem due to
the negligence of the fraternities in
taking pains to keep uninvited per-
sonnel from crashing their parties.
Hibbard suggested that each frater-
nity representative bring this prob-
lem to the attention of his house in
an attempt to minimize future trouble.

In addition, Hibbard plans to write
letters to the Lexington and Buena
Vista papers explaining the situation.
If future incidents arise, it may be-
come necessary for visitors to pre-
sent their college LD.’s to be ad-;
mitted to the parties on big week-
ends

Still on the subject of Fancy Dress
woes, it was noted that $300 was
stolen from fraternity houses over
the wekend, mostly from the purses
of girls whose dates failed to make
sure that the purses were not left
out where they could be pilfered)
by any stray individual who might)
wander in. Sheets reminding the
girls of this danger are being plan-
ned for posting at all the neighbor-
ing girls’ schools before big week-
ends.

the EC in a special election yesterday
to replace former member John Hein-
zerling; Heinzerling dropped out of
school this semester.

Plans are also underway for the
Committee to collect and audit all the
books and accounts of each school
group for the past semester. Work is
being done on this now with the ten-
tative completion date set for February
15.

In what was perhaps the most im-
portant decision of the Monday meet-
ing, the Committee made plans to re-
view and evaluate the results of the
student body referendum of Decem-
ber 13 regarding a possible change
in the powers and purposes of the As-
similation Committee and, if need be,
the student attitude toward the neces-
sity of the conventional dress tradition
itself.

Final results of the referendum will
be presented to the EC at next Mon-
day’s meeting. Kulp emphasized that
particular attention will be paid to
Section No. 2 of the write-in ballots to
see if there is any one general trend
in the way of new ideas on conven-
tional dress and assimilation. While
there is no way of telling exactly what
the outcome will be—if there is to be
any change—Kulp said that this issue
will be given a great deal of considera-
tion before any final decision is
reached.

DANCE BOARD NOTICE

The Dance Board advises all stu-
| dents who plan to have dates staying
in the Lexington area during the
Springs Weekend (April 23-24) to get
rooms in town immediately. VMI's
Spring Weekend occurs on the same
weekend and will create a severe
rooming shortage.

Bus Service
To Operate
Each Weekend

For the remainder of this semester.
bus service will be provided to and
from the local girl's schools on the
weekends. On regular weekends, buses
will arrive from the girl’s schools at
1:00 p.m. and return to them at 11:45
p.m. The service which is sponsored
by the Interfraternity Council will cost
$1.25 one-way and $2.00 round-trip.

The bus service is not totally new.
It was experimented with last semes-
ter. Since then the program has been
improved and many of the defects
ironed out.

A major change in the revised pro-
gram is that transportation will now
be provided from the girl's schools and
not just back to them. Also students
will no longer have to sign up for the
service ahead of time. A regular sched-
ule has planned, taking into
consideration the activities of all the
schools involved, so that anyone wish-
ing to use the buses only has to board
the bus at the scheduled time

Schedules

been

for this semester are
available at the Corner Grill and at
the three clothing stores here in Lex-

ington.

By GARRY APGAR
Joseph Shane, a southern labor

eral classes the following morning.

Mr. Shane, who received both his

Chaffin Sees
Heavy Activity
As Necessary

The snow now covering this Lex-
ington campus seems no more
blanketing than Washington and
Lee’s debate program for the sec-
ond semester. The program will at-
tain a “new look” according to
coach William Chaffin in one of a
flurry of announcements issued from
his office this week.

“We have been pleased with the
program thus far”; said Chaffin,
“however, we hope to expand it to
include more people during the next
semester.”

Chaffin said he plans more activity
both on the intercollegiate and cam-
pus levels.

“Intensive practice and research is
what makes a winner,” commented
Chaffiin. “We have some of the best
personnel on the East Coast and we
hope to prove it this Spring. How-
ever, in order to accomplish this
we're going to have to practice and
do quite a bit of case research.”

He went on to explain that a
winning combination was hard to at-
tain because there were not enough
intercollegiate tournaments to allow
each individual student to attain
his full potential. Chaffin believes

 

local tourneys will help solve this!

problem.

Rick Kneipper and Billy Cannon
were given R. E. Lee Research
| Scholarships in other debate activity
and join Dave Marchese, Sam Fra-
zier, Bill Grant and Alan Cohen
on the team’s central staff. Kneipper,
a Lambda Chi senior from Port
Charlotte, Fla., will head the pro-
gram’s research department. Cannon,
|a Phi Ep junior from Culpeper, Va.,
will serve as the freshman team
coordinator and publicity director.

In an interview with the Ring-
itum Phi Thursday Cannon said a

local novice tournament has ben
scheduled for Wednesday February
| 10.

“The tournament is open to any
i student who hasn't debated intercol-
legiately this year whether they've
| been involved in other phases of the
idebate program or whether they
| believe that they'd like to give it a
itry,” Cannon said.

“Times” Editor To Speak
On “Presidential Politics”

BY TOM DOSS
Thomas G. Wicker, Chief of the Washington Bureau of
The New York Times and author of Kennedy Without Tears
has accepted an invitation to speak at CONTACT according

Mr. Wicker’s address is to be
An Evolving Concept.”

Wicker’s ac-
ceptance, Brownell stated that “Mr.
Wicker is unusually capable in the
area of Presidential politics. Repre-
senting a newspaper that many con-
sider the finest in the world, he will
be able to bring to CONTACT a
sense of proximity to power.”
“Mr. Wicker has also expressed
his willingness to talk with people
interested in journalism and politics

on an informal basis,’ Brownell
added.

Born June 18, 1826, in Hamlet,
North Carolina, Mr. Wicker is a

1948 graduate from the University
of North Carolina. From his gradua-
tion until 1952, he was associated
with various North Carolina news-
papers. In that year he entered
training at Officer’s Candidate
School at Newport, Rhode Island
and became ensign, USNR. He serv-
ed for two years in Japan and was
discharged in 1954.

Washington Reporter
He returned to the Winston-Salem
Journal and in 1957 became Wash-
ington reporter. Later that year he
was awarded a Nieman Fellowship
to Harvard University.

In 1960 Mr. Wicker joined the
staff of The New York Times Wash-
ington Bureau and covered the
White House, Capitol and national
politics. In this capacity he covered
most of the events of the Kennedy
Administration, and he was riding in
the Presidential motorcade in Dallas
on November 22, 1963, when the
President was asssinated.

Kennedy Without Tears

He is the author of six novels,
the most recent being Kennedy
Without Tears. This book, sixty-one
pages in length, was first published
in Esquire Magazine. In his intro-
duction to the book, Arthur Krock
(of the Times) says, “...Tom Wicker
has rendered the service to contem-
porary and future history of striking
at a legend in the first phase of its
mounting evolution. The truth ex-
plains what the gathering myth ob-
scures—that Kennedy was endear-
ingly and admirably human.”

M. L. Kalb, writing in Book Week,
said of Kennedy Without Tears:

. Wieker’s is a perfect conclusion
to a tour through Kennedyana. It
is itself witty, well written, and
wise.

Clothes Do Not Reflect Individualism

While frantically scanning the bulletin board in front of
Payne Hall at 8:25 in search of the room number in which
Horticulture 208 met, a mimeographed sheet caught our eye.

By the time we returned to read it after class, someone had
placed an advertisement for a used Maserati 5000 GT (bright
red) over it. But, ever mindful of our duty to know all, see all,
and say nothing, we removed the ad. After reading the sheet
more carefully, we felt a better purpose would be served by
leaving the ad where it was.

“Down with tradition... tear off your rags of conform-
ity...,” or something like that. It was an old approach to an
old queston. Washington and Lee was compared to a huge
metropolis where insecure youngsters band together on street
corners to fight the hardships of the big city wearing the same
kind of leather jackets. Dramatic, isn’t it?

The wearing of a coat and tie was, as usual, the point of
this type of document. By now this should be a dead issue, but
some never-say-die, change for the sake of change advocates
feel all tradition must go.

What these freshmen (obviously) do not realize is that
becoming adjusted to one’s environment does not mean total
and weak-willed conformity.

One W&L professor asks, “Why can’t we have at least one
beatnik on campus?” We can, if that’s what we need; but it
seems that “at least one individualist (or a lot of them) would
be a bit more beneficial to campus life.

We fail, however, to see how wearing a tie or not wearing
a tie will, in any way, reinforce a person’s individualism.

 

Head of Student Library Committee
Describes Its Procedures, Purpose

Editor’s note: In order to inform
freshmen and upperclassmen on
the workings of their four student
committees, the Library Commit-
tee, Cold Check Committee, Stu-
dent Control Committee, and the
Assimilation Committee, we are
running a series of articles by the
respective committee heads. This
is the first article of that series.

Hidden among its associate organ-
izations (the Cold Check Commit-
tee, the Assimilation Committe and
the Student Control Committee) is
the Student Library Committee.
Students, in many instances, are

 

unaware of its existence or unfamil-
iar with its aims.

The Library Committee does not
consider its task to be chiefly a
disciplinary one. It doesn’t fulfill the
role of a student proctor or over-
seer. Primarily, the committee seeks
to promote better cooperation be-
tween the student body and McCor-
mick Library with its six depart-
mental branches. It strives to in-
sure the libraries’ facilitites are kept
free for general use, and that li-
brary privileges are not abused.

The Committee acts as a mediator
between the students and the li-

 

Liberty Hall Society Serves

As Informal Seminar Group

By STEVE MEIXNER

In the tradition of the campus tit-|
erary societies which were the cen-
ter of student life during the first
half of the nineteenth century, the
Liberty Hall Society was established
at Washington and Lee University. |
Founded in 1959 by Peter Lee, Tim|
Ireland, and Jon MeLin, the Society
is aimed at stimulating discussion on}
a wide range of topics between it’s!

 

If it takes an open collar to make a W&L man an individual-
ist, then either W&L men or individualism leaves a great to
be desired.

Toward A Better Grading System

Has it ever seemed unfair to you that two students, one
having an 81 average and the other an 89 average, receive the
same grade in a course and are credited with the same number
of quality points? Each receives a B in the three-hour course
and each is credited with six quality points, even though the
student having the 89 average has just missed getting the A
and the student having the 81 average has just escaped a C.

Our grading system is too general if it makes no distinction
between such differing averages. This system motivates the
student to shoot for the lowest possible B since there is no re-
ward for increased effort within the B range of grades. The
same holds true for the C, D, and F grade range.

We would like to propose for the consideration of the
self-study committee on grades a system of plus-es. A B*
would be worth 2.5 quality points, a C* would be worth 1.5
quality points, a D*—.5 and an F* would be negative .5. It
seems that this system would increase motivation and incorpor-
ate some of the advantages of number grading now lacking.

College Pressures Part One: The Student

 

Tragic Tale of Chaz Bimberg

as normal-looking as any other stu-
dent at Ampersand, except, per-

By TIM CROWLEY

Author's note: The following
case history was disclosed to me
by Dean Rodriguez of Ampersand
University. It concerns one Chaz
Bimberg, a student who enrolled
in the freshman class last Septem-
ber, suffered a complete mental
collapse one week later, and since
that time has been shut in the
locked Reserve Book Cage until
his parents arrived from Majorca
(Mallorca?) and make more suit-
able arrangements with the local
sanitarium. Dean Redrigues’ desire
that this stery be made public was
a direct result of the issue of Life
last month which discussed the
rising pressures on college stu-
dents at Eastern Universities. At
Ampersand (the Queen's college
of the South), the Dean found in-
dications of just such pressures
on his students and is now under-
taking a reorganization of policy
which will serve to prevent any
more freshmen from following in
the footsteps of the unfortunate
Bimberg. In the meantime, we at
Washingten and Lee can undoubt-
edly benefit from this transcript of
the Dean's report te the Adminis-
trative Committee at Ampersand

lem. What's that? Oh yes, of course.
Those are his eyes, that’s his nose,
and this undoubtedly is his mouth.
But as you can see he seems per-
fectly ordinary. The point I'm mak-
ing is that what happened to Chaz
could have happened to any of our
students

But let us get down to facts.
Until he arrived here last Septem-
ber, Chaz had spent his entire life
on the island of Maporca or Mal-
lorca with only an eccasional trip
to Balleny to break the monotony
of his existence. His father, a
prominent olive grower who inter-
married with a member of the
native population, never allowed
Chaz to drink, smoke, or associate
with any of his classmates at Mo-
jorea or Mallorea High, and it
seems that on Chaz’ tenth birth-
day Mr. Bimberg bought his son
a pet gibbon which has been his
sole childhood companion and
playmate. (Oddly enough, it was
the gibbon which served as an
additional setback te the boy's ad-
justment when, at the termination
of Rush Week, Chaz was forced

Then he assigns them Plutarch’s
Lives as parallel reading, in Latin
of course, and tells them that the
person sitting in the desk next to
them will either be flunked or
dead or both by second semester.
After that, he reads an editorial
from the school paper with which
he disagrees and tears into bits.
Then he dismisses class.

“After sitting through this lecture
five times in two days, Chaz was on
the verge of collapse, but what
really put him ‘over the hill,” so to
speak, was the incident in the Mick-
or-Mack library that evening. With-
out reading the library rules pamph-
let, Bimberg went there to check out
books he would need for a term
paper ,and strictly by chance all his
selections from the card catalogue
were on Locked Reserve. As is the
custom, the librarian remined him
that his books had to be returned by
nine o'clock the next morning and
that there was a fine of fifty cents a
minute if they were overdue. It was
then that Bimberg'’s mind cracked
and we were forced to confine him

To prevent such acts, it has the
power to fine students directly or

To the Editor:

I am both shocked and saddened

to

believe your readers deserve to
learn something about the dastardly
activities of this insidious menace
to our society.

So far as I ean tell, the group
is mainly composed of freshmen, and

 

at the present time they are rela-
tively dormant in their activities.
However, given the proverbial rash-
ness of the freshman, there is no
telling what might happen.

This cell is so highly organized
that it even is headed by the usual
“Grand Lizard” at the top. This
despicable individual apparently is
the founder and motivating spirit
behind the whole plot.

The goals of this group are shad-
owy and dangerous. There is talk of

their plans blossoming into some |
terrible fruition are frightening to |

If Washington and Lee is the type |
of school at which a KKK chapter |
can exist, it is a sad day for the}
“Lee” end of the University’s name.

condoned the mysterious silly busi-|

Professor’s Salaries
In Rider’s System

By BRUCE W. RIDER

Now that the Great Machine (peo-
ple are such damned nuisances) has
spewed forth the various copies of
semester grades (white copy for the
student, green copy for the parents,
and purple copy for the draft board)
it might be wise for us of this fine
paper of news to explain to those
who may not be enlightened what all
those little grades really stand for.

Here at Washington and Lee, the
finest institution of higher learning
in Rockbridge County if not in the
entire Shenandoah Valley—here, I
say, at W&L, we have a neat system
of grading which is as follows: the
highest grade is an ‘A,’ given to sen-
iors majoring in the subject in which
the grade is given. The next grade,
‘B, is given to juniors under like
circumstances.

Should the student, foolish lad,
stray from his major subject to
another course, he is given a Hook,
or ‘C, since his name is not on
the Departmental List of Majors.
The next grade down is a ‘D,
which signifies that the student
has cut too many classes and has
thus incurred the wrath of the
professor, who does not get any
cuts and is jealous of those who
do. And an ‘F’ signifies that the
student is “not activating his max-
imum potential,’ as we say in
academic circles. There is also a
grade given in Physical Education,
a ‘P, but since this newspaper is
sent through the mails I am not
at liberty to say what this letter
represents.

3ut why, may ask (clever
reader you) should we have all this
fuss and bother about such a silly
matter Aren't we just
supposed to be Learning for Learn-
ing’s Sake and not to be concerned
over such a trivial thing as semester

reader, a good question.

reports?

We have come upon an idea or
two (in part suggested by a friend)
which might help us arrive at a
happier situation concerning grades
in this intellectual Disneyland called
college.

Why not have the students grade
the professors? There is precedent
for something like this: during the
Middle Ages (roughly between
the Fall of the Roman Empire—in
color—and the New Deal) univer-
sities were established for the
benefit of (it's hard to believe) the
students, At the end of class the
students would plunk down his
little bag of coins on the pro-
fessor's desk in payment if, of
course, the lecture had been a
good one.

Instead of students being graded

iat the end of the semester by the
teachers, let's try it the other way
around. Each class would decide

upon a grade for the professor in
and all of the profes-
sor’s class grades would be averaged
together to get his grade point ratio.

An article appeared in the Fancy |

&L Cagers Lose to Roanoke C., 71-61

Inability to Score Early in 2nd Half
Proves Fatal for Cold WGL Squad

By GUY UNANGST

Washington and Lee’s basketball team was like a morning
shower last night—hot and cold. Or hot and non-hot.

The Generals poured in shots for awhile—when they could
get the ball downcourt—then found the basket curiously hos-

tile. Things got curiouser and curiouser and they lost to Roa-
*

noke, 71-61.

In the first half W&L didn’t miss
for six and a half minutes, and this
had it even at the half. In the sec-
ond period, the Generals didn’t hit
for 9:15, and Roanoke had a 12-point
lead.

W&L showed the effects of the loss
of their No. 1 jumper, Jeff Twardy,
who fell on the academic rocks.
Roanoke outrebounded W&L, 51-31,
and 2-1 in the second half.

That told the story, since Roa-
noke was doing worse from the floor.
The Maroons hit only 28.6 per cent,
compared to W&L’s 32.8 per cent.

The Generals hit eight of their
first ten shots, and moved into a
29-21 lead three-quarters of the way
through the first half. Then they
stopped hitting and Roanoke pulled

ahead, 32-31. Five foul shots tied
the score.

Roanoke outscored W&L, 17-4
early in the second half, W&L

making only one of its first 17 shots.
The Generals came alive briefly,
pulling within nine points, but then
Butch Prillaman (eight points in the
last ten minutes) led Roanoke out
of trouble.

Prillaman got 13, John Mongero
17, but W&L's Dick Livingston was

the game’s high scorer. He had 22
points, nine on three-point plays.
Jody Kline added 11.

For a change, fouls weren't the big
problem. W&L collected only 18, a
season low. ..Bob Spessard fouled
out midway in the second half...
Kline and Larry Perrault started at
points (guards) last night... . One
good thing: North Carolina Wesleyan
is on next year’s schedule—the third

W&L Weentlors
To Face N.C.
State, Duke

By TOM WHITE

Ready for action after a three-
week exam break, the Washington

and Lee wrestling squad goes after
its fifth and sixth wins of the season
in two home encounters this week-
end.

The Generals tonight will face
North Carolina State while tomor-
row night Duke will be in town.
Both matches will start at 8:30 p.m.
at Doremus Gym.

N.C. State last year defeated the
Generals by a 19-13 score. But coach
Dick Miller reports State is not too
strong this year. State was hard-hit
by graduations after last year’s sea-
son and, as a result, has only one
starter back from last year’s squad,
Brawlee at 167 pounds. He will face
Pete Winfield. One other tough
wrestler for State is Wayland whom
coach Miller described as “a good
heavyweight.”

State has met only one squad
W&L has already faced and that is
North Carolina. W&L downed N.C.
earlier this season and N.C. then
went on to defeat State.

Duke should provide the tougher
opposition for the General matmen.
They have already beaten N.C. State
and also have several veterans back
from last year’s team which lost
to W&L 21-13.

The Generals should find their
toughest competition from two Duke
wrestlers who defeated W&L men
last year. They are Holden at 147
who beat Jamie Andrew last year
and Lam at 167.

While refusing to predict the out-
come of the weekend’s competition
coach Miller did say, “If we are in
good condition after the layoff—and
I think we are—we should do all
right.” He cautioned, however, that
“Duke is always unpredictable.” No
General matmen were lost due to
academic trouble.

While the varsity wrestlers seek

Grebanier Speaks at VMI
In University Center Plan

The University Center in Virginia
will present its first speaker of a
series at VMI’s Scott Shipp Hall,
room 318, on February 23. Profes-
sor Bernard Grebanier, a prolific
author and noted Shakespearing
critic entitles his topic “A Measure
of Shakespeare as Poet and Dram-
atist.”

Born in 1903, Professor Grebainer
studied to be come a concert pianist.
But during his last weeks as an un-
graduate at the City College of New
York, he was offered a_ position
there teaching Shakespeare the fol-
lowing year, and accepted. In 1930 he

the IFC, your columnist for the
mighty round-table of fraternity

representatives is back with his pro-
ductive and critical pen—( productive
and critical—sure!)

The first and most startling news
of the evening was the IFC financial
report. It included approximately
$2,000 income and $3,965 expendi-
tures, thus contributing to an over-
all $1,542 deficit plus the foreign
student assessment of $1,200 yet to
be paid. The total for the year will
probably reach at least $2,742. Faced
with this deficit, the IFC voted to
pay off the debt with a general as-
sessment of all the houses

tensively in his field. In the period
between 1928 and 1962, Mr. Gre-
banier completed more than fifteen
books.

Writing criticism or Shakespeare,
however, was has not been the
professor’s only interest. Various of
his stories, essays, and poems have
appeared in such nationally known
periodicals as The New Yorker,
Story, Gentleman’s Quarterly, and
Shenandoah. His particular article
in the Washington and Lee Review,
entitled “Lady Macbeth of London,”
appeared in the Summer 1962 issue.

“Visiting Scholar” program is only
one of a number of enterprises un-

Organized in 1946 by nine cooper-

the University Center represents a
group effort to bring noted thinkers

its founding, fifteen other colleges
have joined, thus enabling additional
cooperative ventures, such as a Fac-

chosen soon to serve with them for

Ideas for Change

Among the various proposals for
change in the policy the following
were considered the most construc-
tive by Brown. The membership of
the committee should be larger and
subject to election by the students
rather than appointment by the EC.
There was also a plea for open hear-
ings and more lenient discipline.
Finally, one student proposed a sys-
tem of enforcement through the fra-
ternities. The fraternities would be
held responsible for violations of
their members.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

The University Infirmary

On Saturday night a junior varsity wrestler broke his
arm in two places in a match in Doremus Gymnasium.
Coach Norris Eastman correctly diagnosed the arm as
broken and sent the man to the infirmary. There, how-
ever, the victim was told that his condition was not very
serious, and that since the case was not an emergency,
he could not be sent to the hospital and the University
physician, Dr. Feddeman, could not see him.

On Sunday the arm was x-rayed and the double frac-
ture discovered by Dr. Feddeman, who wrapped the arm
back up in an Ace bandage and told the victim to come
back the next day, when the swelling would have subsided.

In this case the policy that a student must go through
the infirmary before receiving any medical treatment in
Lexington, could have resulted in serious trouble—and it
wouldn’t have been the first time. There is absolutely no
reason why a college man should be hindered in going to
the physician of his choice or in going to the hospital
when he thinks it necessary. Of course, the infirmary re-
plies that there is really no rule that W&L men can’t go
to outside physicians; but if this is so, where did the hos-
pital get the idea of an infirmary “okay” for W&L Men?
And why does a coach tell the men on his team they must
go through the infirmary? Worst of all, why does the
University refuse to accept an absence excuse from any
doctor other than Dr. Feddeman?

Beyond the usual exaggeration in stories about a
school physician, there is considerable justification in com-
plaints about the W&L infirmary. There is also consider-
able substance to some of the stories about students who
have been “mistreated” at the hands of the infirmary
staff; the sample case of last weekend is not one of the
worst examples. Criticism from the Ring-tum Phi has been
consistently modest, but it would not be difficult to find
students with stronger opinions on the subject of Dr. Fed-
deman and the infirmary. In this year of complete self-
study we hope the University will not neglect its infirmary
program, and that this long-standing problem area will
be improved in some measure.

 

The Collegian Answers Critics

The Fancy Dress issue of the Southern Collegian con-
tained one of the most hopeful developments in student
activities this year:the revival of the Collegian as a serious
vehicle of campus criticism. For the first time in recent
years the Collegian printed an editorial focusing its at-
tention chiefly on the danger that academic excellence
may be reached at the expense of the social graces which
supposedly characteize the “W&L gentleman.” The edi-
torial also commented on the library, the possibility of
separating the law school from the college, and the possi-
bility of allowing dates in the dormitories.

Each of these issues deserves the fullest consideration
of the administration as well as the student body. (Mem-
bers of the administration who have treated themselves
to the privilege of not reading the Collegian for many
years, would do well to give it one more chance.) In par-
ticular, the inadequacy of the library is a problem which
should be sharply outlined in the present self-study pro-
gram and ought to receive immediate attention.

The “new look” of the Collegian is less an innovation
than a return to traditional policies of the magazine, which
is in its fourth quarter-century of publication. It is defi-
nitely a change for the better, one which gives the maga-
zine a purpose other than to revel in its own obscenity—
a remarkable tendency of some past issues. And the Fancy
Dress reversion to a serious purpose, whether by coinci-
dence or not, was matched by some of the best articles—
and more of them—which have appeared in recent col-
umes of “the South’s most maligned magazine.” The
Fancy Dress issue is a good answer to the Collegian’s
critics, who were becoming more and more vocal.

The Vestiges of Hazing

Despite the fact that the administration and the IFC
have officially abolished Hell Week and “Help Week,”
several fraternities managed, as usual, to preserve last
week the essentials of their programs to degrade their
pledges. It is amazing that there exist such barbaric haz-
ing practices as were carried out in the last week; it is
even more fantastic that college men could pretend to
believe that this medieval terrorism can induce brother-
hood in the typically sophisticated young men of Wash-
ington and Lee's freshman class. And perhaps it is also
amazing that a college junior or senior should be willing
to waste his time in the horseplay of brotherhood-by-
degradation.

It is incumbent on the Interfraternity Council to
be more active next year in preventing Hell Week prac-
tices. Even more, it is incumbent on this year's pledges
to remember what hazing is like from the viewpoint of
the pledge. If they are able to retain a realistic viewpoint,
they will not support hazing next year as sophomores. Let
the freshmen remember that it is only a desire for ven-
gence which perpetuates hazing, and let them resolve now
that next year they will have no part of such “revenge”;
that they will have no part of activities which waste the
time of all concerned, which can benefit only the twisted.

  
 
 
 
 

* Doremus Revisited”

 

y BIFF BARKER

Tuesday Columnist
It was just a lazy winter day. The
sun was shining, and it was warm.
It would have been a perfect day
to go off into the hills somewhere,
sit in the snow, and study for exams.
But on the Washington and Lee
campus, the students were so excit-
ed, they could hardly study. This
was student assembly day! Terrified
lest they break The Absence Rule,
(“We have but one rule...”) the
law students streamed forth from
Tucker Hall and raced to the mag-
nificent Doremus Auditorium. Huff-
ing and puffing in the other direc-
tion, a French professor slid past
the library on his way to his office.

He had forgotten his robe.

The students filed into the rear of

the auditorium, respectfully saving
the front seats for the faculty. The
place was packed. Some couldn’t
even see, and had to sit on the
wrestling mats on the balcony.

Soon the students were all seated,
awaiting the picturesque pageant
which was about to unfold for them.
The procession began with a dramatic
blast, as a scratchy recording of
Tachaikovsky’s “March of the Wood-
en Soldiers” blared forth from the
public address system. First came
someone carrying a beautifully dec-
orated wooden club on a_ velvet
pillow, but no one was quite sure
who he was. Then, bedecked in their
colorful black regalia, in all their
academic splendor, in marched the
faculty!

Delighted, the students with awe

  
 

drank in the sight of these men
marching past them—these men who
had guided them; these men who
had broadened their horizons; these
men who had nurtured their intel-
lectual curiosity; these men who
would be giving them exams the
next day. Some freshmen students,
woefully ignorant of their military
obligation, wondered why the ma-
rines in their dress blue uniforms
had infiltrated the academic line.
The procession completed, Presi-
dent Cole announced that Dr. Hodges
would give the invocation. Enthusi-
astically rising to the occasion, the
students stood up. Following the
invocation Dean Sprunt to a captive
audience gave a talk on Robert E.
Lee. Dean Sprunt’s speech was a

Rives Looks Forward to “Thunderball”

 

Critic Praises “Man from Rio”

By MAC RIVES
Cinema Columnist

Sometimes there’s nothing to write
about. Not about movies, at least,
which are then discussed, inade-
quately (sic), through random notes.

Two Women has returned to the
Lyric. It’s from the Moravia novel
of the same name, which is to say it’s
bittersweet. The direction is by De-
Sica, in deterioration since Bicycle
Thief, but who still composes with
precision, an unusual, if here unex-
citing, characteristic. Moreover, the
acting is good, just as it was three
years ago, when Two Women first
played at the Lyric, and as it will
be the same time hence, in Lexing-
ton. Due preda. Raf Vallone is par-
ticularly good as the truck driver.

Goldfinger is completing a week's
run at the State. One either laughs
with Bond or he doesn't. The reac-
tien isn't so much conditioned by

one’s taste as it is at his frame of
mind (an extremely subtile distinc-
tion which can be overlooked). Still,
reluctantly, I am looking forward to
Thunderball and a better seat, the
latter with a concomitant absence
of anterior remarks, not previously
referred to: “She's terrible:” “They
expect me to believe that?”
Critics, reviewers, writers continue
to pose intelligent, much as another
personality pretends, again to have
scheduled an interesting array of
movies. Recently, an associate, en
route to High’s lee Cream, was drag-
ged into the foyer highlighted by
a blurred flame profie of Richard
Widmark. He was ,obviously enough,
then informed of the _ ensuing
month’s program. “I've got some real
good ones. “Yeah.” Aictually he has
booked That Man from Rio, chosen
Best Picture of 1964 by the New
York Film Critics, yet appropriately.

It features Jean-Paul Belmondo and
Francoise Dorleac and poison darts
and Brasilia. Carping becomes tire-
some and it is nice to be able to
praise and anticipated a movie, the
success of which, one judges, is to
be credited to the wild direction of
Philippe de Broca and the music of
Georges Delerue as well as to the
principals mentioned above. One can
apply the current criticism of God-
ard to de Broca—he allows private
film jokes to mar is work (ie., Dele-
rue’s score is a parody of that from
Black Orpheus); but it is more
likely that the viewer will forget
such relations, if he happens to be
aware of them, and enjoy the movie.
It's hard not to.

Also coming: The Magnificent Sev-
en, The Girl with the Green Eyes
and The Silence, the last predict-
ably exploiting the now-famous s-t
elisions.

The Pressure Mounts at Ampersand:
Dean Rodriguez Himself Is Stricken

By ARTHUR McBLAIR CROWLEY

In last week's article, I reviewed
the plight of the Eastern universit-
sity student, using the unfortunate
Chaz Bimberg as an example, At
the time of the incident, it was
generally believed that the stu-
dent was the only victim of col-
legiate pressures. This supposi-
tion was satisfactorily invalidated,
however, when:

At 8:00 in the morning on may 7,
1964, Hugo Redriguez, Dean of Men
at Ampersand University, was found
under his desk by the local authori-
ties. This led to immediate conjec-
ture among the members of the
demic community a to the reason
behind such a move on the Dean's
part. Was he hiding? Was he search-
ing for something that had fallen
en the floor? Was he dead”

Speculation rapidly mounted until
two weeks later when an official
statement was released by the Ad-
ministrative Committee which de-
elared: “The Dean was examining
the weave of his office rug.” Al-
though this did much to dispel the
apprehensions of many, other
skeptical individuals pointed out that
there were quite a number of anoml

“ca

alies in the report: a) There was no
carpet in the Dean’s office; b) It was
impossible to see the weave of the
carpet under the desk because it
was dark there; c) The Dean had
been under his desk for more than
a week ample time to discern not
only the pattern of his rug, but
that there was, in fact, no rug at all.

Twin Beds and a “Vague Unrest!”

Other embarrassing questions were
raised. How had the Dean's absence
gone unnoticed for such an extend-
ed period of time? To this query,
there were interesting replies

Mrs. Lolita Rodriguez: “Huge

have twin beds.”

(The following letter was not
written for the Ring-tum Phi but
was addressed to a member of the
W&L administration. It is printed in
the belief that the author, an alum-
nus, would wish his thoughts to be
made public.)

Dear Sir,

Thank you for Washington and
Lee University. This is not meant
to be dramatic or trite, but from
the heart. As an alumnus one isn’t
confronted with the rigors of the
academic world, although one never
forgets the honor system as a stu-
dent, or the importance thereafter of
being an honorable man.

The Air Force Academy scandal
portrays all too vividly the lack of
integrity in so much of our populous
today. How can one fail to differ-
entiate between telling on your six
year old sister, and upholding a code
of honorable conduct.

Washington and Lee was so for-
tunate to have been able to choose a
Student Body dotted by scholars
both above average and _ below,
thinkers, conformists. Christians and
Jews, but all of whom respected
and revered the system of honor.
This, more than any other quality
makes the phrase School of Gentle-
men meaningful.

Very Sincerely
WARREN R. WELSH

To the Editor:

I would like to protest the letter
from Mr. Naaman Fletcher printed
in the Friday Ring-tum Phi. Mr.
Fletcher is entirely mistaken in his
concept of the Benevolent and Pro-
tective Order of KKK, and indeed
he seems to attempt to lead the read-
ers of your paper into accepting an
image of our organization which is
highly unjust to it.

Actually the KKK is a service or-
ganization, not unlike the SSS, MM,
NOTO, and SWMSFC, and many
others. It performs many highly val-
uable services to the University and
the student body; indeed, without
the Loyal Order of KKK, as we are
also known, who knows what might
happen to the grand traditions of
W&L?

It is true that we favor a return
to the ancient traditions of the Old
South, but this University itself
sands for some of these traditions.
We only go a bit father.

The KKK, is, I might point out,
non-discriminatory. How could an
organization which backed Barry
Goldwater be discriminatory?

In closing, I would like to add that
I hope Mr. Fletcher and his ilk see
the light and cease and desist. If they
don’t, they are likely to find the
Loyal Order of the W&L Un-
American Activities Committee
breathing down their necks.

Sincerely,

THE GRAND LIZARD

W&L Is Third
In ‘Who’s Who’

Washington and Lee ranks third
among private liberal arts colleges
for men in number of graduates list-

Following Williams and Ambherst,
W&L has held the number three po-

appendix to the 1964-65 addition of
Who's Who states that “Williams,
Amherst, and Washington and Lee
seem to be the perennial leaders”
in number of graduates listed in
their category.

The other colleges in the top ten,
in order, are Haverford, Bowdin,

Supposedly out of shape after a two week exam lay-off, the

team is far ahead of its opponents

In recently released statistics, the Washington and Lee wrestling

feat of the season swimmers Nelson
Head, Kester Denman, Bill Wildrick
and Bart Taylor smashed the pool
record set by Maryland in the open-
ing medley relay with a time of
3:41.3. In this same event freshman
Head set a school record for the
100-yard backstroke with a time of
57.8 seconds.

The next record to fall was the
200-yard individual medley in which
George Bokinsky lowered his own
mark to 2:09.1.

Wildrick followed suit by lower-
ing his own mark in the 200-yard
butterfly a significant three seconds
to 2:06.

In the most surprising feat of the
day, sophomore Taylor broke the
record for the 100-yard freestyle
with a time of 48.7.

The final record of the day was
set by Head who slashed eight sec-
onds off the existing school mark in
the 200-yard backstroke by going the
distance in 2:07 minutes.

Such surprising strength shown
Saturday prompted Coach Eastman
to look hopefully for an upset vic-
tory over American University in
Washington this Saturday.

The Washington and Lee basket-
ball team added a new distinction
to this season by becoming Saturday
night the 42nd consecutive victim for

home court. The Ashland, Virginia,
ball club found victory number 42
easier than most as they rolled to

The Generals had a phenomenal
shooting percentage from the foul
line, hitting 19 of 22. Mindel was

How many of you can give the
starting line-up of the 1950 Phila-
delphia Phillies, better known as the
whiz kids? Better yet, who was the
pitcher who served up Roger Maris’
61st home run ball?

Do these sound like ridiculous
questions? They are no more ridicu-
lous than trying to find something
worthy of mention on the local ath-

 

a good reason for the team’s 6-1 record.

W&L has, in the individual matches, outscored the other men, 188-
128. If this does not seem too overwhelming, the General grapplers
have added 19 pins and five forfeits to their total, while holding the
visitors to five pins and no forfeits.

As a team, Coach Miller’s charges have outscored the opposition
171-60 on their way past such foes as Duke, N.N.C., N.C. State, and

the Generals from oblivion.

Speaking of Livingston, I might
mention that it is a pity that Dick)
has had the misfortune this year
to play on a team that has been able
to win only one game. Livingston
deserves more credit than that which
he receives from the students and
athletic department of W&L, but
playing for a losing ball club is not
conducive to getting more than local
recognition. I hate to think how

News Sheet

The Wall, a one-page bulletin pub-
lished by THRUST will make its
first appearance on Wednesday,
February 10. It will be, according
to a THRUST spokesman, a collec-
tion of “brief opinion, sharp satire,
cornball homilies, and pithy com-
mentary.” Material for The Wall will
come from students, faculty, and a
varied group of periodicals.

Bob Stack, an SPE pledge from
Silver Spring, Maryland, will be ed-
iting the bulletin, with assistance
from a committee which includes
Senior Craig Cotton; Junior Jeff
Skarda; and Freshman John Godehn,
Ric Berard, and Steve Saunders.

Styled after the model of a posted
newssheet of the same name at the
University of Edinburgh, The Wall
will be placed on all campus bulle-
tin boards every two weeks. When
asked if there would be any prob-
lem with bulletins being ripped down
by dissenters, Stack said that, “There
is always the group which is going
to display its intolerance of ideas
not in agreement with its own. How-
ever, we believe that the majority
of the Student Body is sufficiently
mature and responsible to see the
foolishness of such a course. We
don’t expect a big problem in that
area.”

Comments on and contributions to
The Wall may be mailed to P.O. Box
10, Lexington, Va.

Due to VMI having a party week-
end this weekend, the IFC buses will

schools at 4 p.m. Sunday.

FASHIONS

BY 0. E. SCHOEFFLER, ESQUIRE’S Fashion Director
THE LAST HURRAH for 1964 is now an echo. The last Christmas

tree has been piled on a blazing bonfire, and your New Year’s reso-
lutions have already had a chance to stand the test of time. One

Chas Bimberg that brought beck resolution every alert college man should make (and keep) is to

old and terrifying memories. Per-| |

look his best at all times. With this thought in mind, let’s take a
quick checkup on your mid-winter wardrobe.

CHESTNUTS ROASTING ON AN OPEN FIRE, ana you warm and

fashionable in your camelhair sweater—an ideal mid-winter pic-
ture. The camelhair sweater is showing a marked popularity this
year on campuses across the country. And again, cardigans cap top
honors, both in button-front and shawl-collar models, and in smart
border stripes. Look for the new cardigans zipped and border-
striped up the front and leather patched on the
sleeves. A continuing favorite is the Shetland
pullover in soft heathery shades of muted blue,
brown and tan with a “brushed surface” effect
in both crew and V-neck styles.

WALKIN’ IN A WINTER WONDERLAND, or

skiing down the powdery white slopes, you'll find

The turtleneck identifies the HOOT. A high-
standing, fold-over turtleneck of rugged rib-
knit, or a “mock” turtle—the high crew-neck—
gives the HOOT a handsome, masculine look.
Heavier, bulkier yarns, and bold patterns, especially the Scandina-
vian designs, are the thing. Brilliant blues, greens, reds and golds
in solid or multi-colored combination stripes and argyles make the
HOOT Sweater an eye-catching invigorating new campus fashion.
HOOT Slacks in tan and bronze corduroy are tapered, trim and
pleatiess, and coordinate perfectly with all ingredients of the HOOT
LOOK.

BABY, IT’S COLD OUTSIDE! But with the proper accessories, you

won't have to worry about the outside weather story. Gloves, often
ignored by college men, are much more than hand-warmers; they
are an integral part of the fashion picture. Sturdy pigskin in the
natural “cork” shade with linings of lambswool or fur are favored
on the cold-weather campus, as are tan knitted wool gloves with
leather palms. Crisp and correct are woolen mufflers in solid colors
or bold Tartan designs. In scarves, the knitted cross-stripes or
border stripes have the edge.

INSIDE OUT, the new reversible outercoat is a

lively, practical way to add variety to your out-
erwear wardrobe. An offshoot of the Tow Coat,
it has a bold plaid wool on one side, and cordu-
roy on the other, and is characterized by a
bulky-knit shaw! collar that stands or rolls down
flat. Rugged and lightweight, it makes an ex-
cellent addition to your mid-winter apparel.

LET IT SNOW! With a sturdy lining to seal out

the cold, you'll be ready for that time-honored

 

 

campus tradition: the annual snowball fight.
There’s a wide-open, warm-up selection to
choose from in color and type of lining. Pile
fabrics, ranging from natural-fiber, natural
color alpaca pile and acrylic fiber piles in bril-
liant colors are high on the popularity list, as
are bright, nylon fleece linings. A real pace-setter is the zip-out
ning of patterned knit. Many linings spill over on the collar fac-

ing for a snappy exterior accent.

So much for our mid-winter checkup. Next month, we'll survey
the exciting fashion news in stretch fabrics. Button-down collar
shirts, sportswear and rainwear will all fall under the fashion eye
So long until then,

Master Plan To Be Outlined

ODK Leadership Forum
To Discuss Self-Study Plan

By BILLY CANNON
News Editor

Dr William Hinton, Chairman of Washington and Lee’s Self-Study
Committee, will present to the Omicron Delta Kappa Leadership Forum
Wednesday, February 17, the University’s master plan for self-study,
touching upon its present value and future implications.

The meeting will be held at 7:00 p.m. in Evans Dining Hall. After Hin-
ton’s presentation there will be a question and answer session at which
time coffee will be served. All members of the Faculty Committee for Self-
Study will be present to answer questions.

The leadership group which includes the presidents of all W&L ac-
tivities was chosen to hear the presentation because it was felt that a de-
tailed presentation could not be given effectively to the student body as
a whole. The ODK Forum allows all segments of the University to be rep-
resented yet keeps the group small enough for an effective questioning
period. Other members of the student body who are particularly interested
in the presentation are invited to attend.

Omicron Delta Kappa President Steve Smith urged all members to be
present. Smith said that it would also be helpful to look over the de-
tailed presentation concerning the self-study given to each member this
week.

Hinton, head of W&l’s Psychology Department explained, “Washing-
ton and Lee University has achieved a reputation for high educational
quality and holds a position of dis-
tinction among American institu-
tions of higher learning. It has
achieved this position through the
effective cooperation of its trustees,
members of its faculty and adminis-
tration, its students, and its alumni. |
These groups, working together)
during many decades, have sought
to maintain and improve the qual-

Zeta Beta Tau regained top academic standing last semes-
ter after a semester’s dethronement. The ZBT house average
was 1.711 as compared with their last June’s average of 1.640.

Although ZBT’s average is higher than PiKA’s top av-
erage of 1.684 last June, 1964, the all men’s average, the all
fraternity men’s average, and the all non-fraternity men’s av-
erage fell from last June. The all men’s average fell from
1.509 to 1.447, the all fraternity men’s average fell from 1.489
to 1.425, and the all non-fraternity men’s average fell from
1.578 to 1.533.

self-study will be conducted to al-
low (1) an appraisal to be made of
the University’s current strengths
and opportunities for immediate
and future improvement and (2) recommendations for change to be form-
ulated and implemented now and in the future.”

 

The self-study is to be undertaken for two related and complementary
purposes:

To prepare Washington and Lee for a visit by a committee from
the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Col-
leges and Schools. Such a visit, under the Institutional Self-Study
and Periodic Visitation Program, is required by the association
each ten years and should be completed at Washington and Lee
in 1966. In preparation for the visit, it will be necessary to com-
plete a comprehensive self-study and prepare a thorough self-
study report.

To provide the University with more comprehensive and
definitive plans for its own future development than now exist.
These plans can provide a foundation for further planning effort in
years ahead.

“We have no worries about meeting the Association's accreditation
standards,” Hinton said. “However, the real purpose of this study is much
broader and deeper. We hope to study all aspects of life here at Wash-
ington and Lee. The recommendations of each of our committees will be
made available for future use in possible improvement of facilities and
conditions.”

The self-study program in itself will not lead to any direct
action concerning future actions. The information obtained from
the study, however, may be beneficial to the famulty, administra-
tion, and Board of Trustees when they meet to consider possible
future actions.

The study does contain sections which ask the individual
committees to judge the University’s needs in five and ten years
and make recommendations concerning these needs.

“We can't determine how useful the study will be,” Hinton
commented, “Only time will reveal the long run implications of a
program of this nature.”

The target date for the completion of the program is January 1966

Thus far the entire study has been in the hands of the Self-Study Commit- |

tee. They have met 17 times since October to set up the basic objectives
and work out the mechanics of the program
Aside from Hinton the committee is composed of Dean Lewis W.

In announcing Mr. Ives’ acceptance,
Brownell stated that “Mr. Ives is con-
sidered by many to be one of the
most able exponents of the Conserva-
tive political philosophy in America
today, and he is therefore unusually
qualified to provide a certain ‘political
balance’ for CONTACT.”

A native of Connecticut, Mr. Ives
attended Brown University where he
graduated cum laude in 1925, receiv-
ing an A.B. degree and in 1938 he re-
ceived an M.A, degree from Yale Uni-
versity. He was associated with vari-
ous newspapers before joining the
Baltimore Sun in 1939. He is current-
ly an associate editor for the Sun.
He is also co-editor for the Burke
Newsletter.

Mr. Ives was a visiting lecturer in
political science at Goucher College
from 1952 to 1956. His most recent
college appearances were in a pro-
gram of the Edmund Burke Society
at the Georgetown University anni-
versary commemoration and on an
orientation panel for freshmen at
Goucher College.

In commenting on Mr. Ives’ topic,
Brownell stated that “his topic will

Self-Study: Now’s Our Chance

A little known, but important, survey being conducted at
W&L has received so little publicity that few students realize
more than the fact that a self-study is in progress.

In order to maintain its position of distinction as an insti-
tution of high educational quality at a time when the needs of
society and the programs of other institutions are changing
significantly, it was decided that an institutional self-study
would be conducted. Thus, an appraisal could be made of the
University’s current strengths and opportunities for improve-
ment, and recommendations for change could be formulated
and implemented.

The self-study was undertaken to prepare for a visit from
the Commission on Colleges required of all accredited insti-
tutions, and to provide the University with more comprehen-
sive and definitive plans for its own future development.

It becomes immediately obvious that students, as well as
faculty members, alumni, trustees, and administrative officials,
must be included in such a self-study if it is to have a more
nearly complete degree of validity. Without the student view-
point, the self-study would be grossly lacking in perspective
in the areas of class scheduling, grading, community service,
the library, publications, religious life, discipline, student gov-
ernment and organizations, the honor system, extra-class ac-
tivities, fraternities, dining halls and dormitories, intra-mural
athletics, inter-collegiate athletics, and student health services.
The void left by a lack of student participation in such areas
is obvious.

One important aspect of student life now omitted in the
self-study program is that of non-fraternity life, particularly
in reference to facilities (the need for a real student union).
Perhaps such a blatantly deficient area has been deliberately
ignored.

The success of the self-study depends in large measure
on the effective involvement of all members of the University
community. Students may participate in various study and dis-
cussion groups on topics related to students’ affairs and of con-
cern to students. Indeed, their participation is vital if the self-
study is to be valid in the area of student life.

The Leadership Forum, to be held Wednesday the 17th,
will treat the self-study program. Dr. Hinton, chairman of the
study, will review its plan and purpose in a brief talk and the
floor will then be opened for questioning. We applaud the pur-
pose of this forum and urge that any students interested in
hearing about the self-study be present. The forum is to be
completely open.

Participation in the program may be sought by consulting
with the Dean of Students, the Dean of the College, or Dr.
Hinton. Those concerned with taking part in the self-analysis
should plan to attend the forum. The administration will not
force you to participate; future plans for the University’s
development depend, partly, on your initiative.

Springs Weekend: A Proposal

Saturday classes may be generally ineffective, but the av-
erage Saturday class is a veritable fortress of intellectual curi-
osity compared to the Saturday classes held during Openings
and Springs weekends.

Professors are dismayed, but hardly surprised, at finding
two-thirds of the class absent at these times. Only those stu-
dents who have to be in class for fear of overcutting and flunk-
ing the course or those who find anything to be better than
facing that awful last-minute blind date again are present.
The result is that both students and faculty members are in-
effective, and the class is a total loss.

 

 

Furthermore, the University sponsors the social events
held on Friday and is somewhat idealistic in expecting a stu-
dent to recover from such in time for a Saturday morning
class. The University has sponsored the event, it knows the
student will be up late, yet demands that he deposit his body

in duPont 561 at 8:25 the next morning. Such a demand seems
unrealistic.

We propose, therefore, that the University do away with
the classes usually held on the Saturday of Springs Weekend
as an experiment to see if anything would be lost by not having

these classes. Surely their rescheduling can’t be too much of a
task,

 

Heart Fund Deserves Support

The students of W&L have been given an excellent Op
portunity to help in the Heart Fund Drive on Thursday, Feb-

bridge County, Mr. Otis Mead, originally confronted the IFC
with the possibility of a student canvass of the county. The re-
sponse of student volunteers from the fraternities and the
Circle K Club has been most encouraging.

There are two reasons why more than 60 students have
already decided to give their time. First, heart disease, accord.

America’s number one killer. Second, in helping with the

I was not aware of Washington and
Lee until about ten years ago when
I was travelling among the prep
schools of the country. When I say
I was not aware of Shakespeare until
I was thirteen, I may show myself to
have been an uninformed child.
Shakespeare is not lessened. When I
say I didn’t know about you, I’m cri-
ticizing you. I was raised on academic
talk.

Is your University as great as
Lee? Is William and Mary to be

compared with Yale or Princeton?
Is The University as great as Jeffer-
son? The source of your lassitude

 

 

and slightness is not to be found in
the men who founded these Virginia
universities but in a complex set of
factors. Let me examine in this and
following articles, one factor among
these: a hesitation to criticize and
discipline yourself.

My criticism is neighborly and
brotherly and hard. I want to be fair
and understanding and even merciful.
You must be generous to allow my
criticism at all. After all, I dare to cri-
ticize a university in which I have
neither studied nor taught. I will at-
tack, not for the first time, fraternities
I have never entered. On the other
hand, I have lived and taught near you
six years now, and have attended lec-
tures and meetings in Lexington. I
have talked with your teachers and
student leaders whom I respect and
admire. My impressions are gathered
from open discussions and this news-
paper, from talks with your alumni
and nearer neighbors. My impressions
are disciplined by the skills I learned
in professional visits to 350 secondary
schools and to universities in eight
countries.

I speak for myself.

You show two faces. You show

the moral schizophrenia common in
our culture. I meet two kinds of
Washington and Lee men. First, the
brave and pleasant students anyone
is glad to see and rejoices to know.
some of you graduates are my fel-
low teachers, now, and my brothers
in the ministery. Second, however,
the slack-bellied, loose-lipped gold-
en drunks deluded into thinking
they are welcome everywhere. I try
not to note one set more than the
other, I remind those who see only
your second face, that the other ex-
ists too.

Our commanding general in Japan
warned us that one careening GI run-
ning down an old woman on the
streets of an occupied village wiped
out the good work of an army. The
men who vomit into our chapel and
relieve themselves in our parking lot
like unhousebroken puppies, who yell
their dirtiest words at the decent wo-
men who work with our students,
erase from our memories too many
gentlemen and _ scholars.

You disappoint your friends when
you play away your opportunities. “I
want some benefit from you.... Re-

Monday a different kind of thing
will happen in duPont Hall.

This time, how-

ry Southern.

What some people say about Candy:
Gore Vidal—“Terry Southern is the
most profoundly witty writer in our
generation.”; Nelson Algren— “There
is no more serious writer in the US.
today ...absolutely first rate... the
work of a major satirist.”; James
Jones—“ salty, irreverent wit and
penetrating humor”; Dwight MacDon-
ald—“The funniest book I have read
in a poon’s age”; Herbert Gold—“Good
grief, it's a very funny book.”

It is for the sake of contrast that
I mention these comments, for quite
frankly I thought the book if taken
in its entirety, to be pretty much of
a bore. And that, I would suggest, is
probably the one response the au-
thors most wanted to avoid. For those
few of you yet unfamiliar with Candy
it is the story of a sexually proco-
cious, though at the same time naive,
young lass who in one way or an-

to practically every extant variety of
manhood—a hunchback, a gardener,
a doctor, her uncle, her father, the
whole array.

In content, Candy, is both satirical
and pornagraphic. Some say the por-
nography is there for the sake of
satire, Others that the satire is for the
sake of pornography. I suggest it i
neither. The authors appear to me too
cynical of human nature to have writ
ten this book with the main intent of
satire, for satire implies an attempt to
ameliorate what is satirized, in this
instance, the pretentiousness of our so-
ciety. A pretentiousness which Hoffen-
berg and Southern would hardly have
expected to puncture effectually

As for the pornographic element in
the book, it is more than ample, both
in quantity and vividness of descrip-
tion. It is presented, however, in a
manner so obviously designed to point
out the absurdities of sex that rath-

 

students are interested in other people.

He first went to the Royal College
in London in 1958, on a Fulbright
Grant. Following a year at the Royal
College, Brewer installed himself in
a studio in Chelsey, England, re-
maining there until his return to
North Carolina a year ago.

His European stay culminated in
1963 in a major exhibition of his work
in Paris. (Some of the pieces from
his Paris show are included in the
duPont exhibition here).

Other major showings of Brewer's
work have been at the Detroit Insti-
tute of Art in Detroit, 1958; at the
Isaac Delgade Museum in New Or-
leans, 1957; at the Galerie Marcelle
Dupuis in Paris, 1961; and at the
Granville Gallery 1963 exhibition in
Asheville, North Carolina.

At present, Brewer’s works are in
three exhibitions in North Carolina
and Virginia.

Spontaneity seems to be the key
both to Brewer the man and Brew-
er the artist. He works in welded
irons and bronzes, he says, because
there is less of a barrier in these
media between the artist’s creative
inspiration and the expression of that
inspiration. Furthermore, he will
not give organized, pre-planned lec -
tures on his work, He prefers sim-
ple spontaneous conversation about
it, freely discussing technique in
general and individual works in
particular, His art is an art of im-
mediacy, of dynamic creativity—
and a pleasing direction in the artis-
try of the atomic age.

The new world employs new tech-
niques, and nowhere is this truer than
in art. Marble and bronze is succeed-
ed by steel and iron in the realm of
sculpture, Brewer uses the new tech-
niques energeticaliy and with consum-
mate artistic result.

The show here is a first for Wash-
ington and Lee. It represents both a
trend and a man that neither can be
nor should be given less than the

Washington and Lee Basketball coach Verne Canfield

for Canfield.

sard played 18 minutes with four
fouls, and got 13 rebounds. Fred Min-
del, a sometime scorer, got 19 points.
But mostly it was Larry Perreault.

Perreault is a 5-foot-9 freshman
guard who played under Canfield at
Anexandria’s Groveton High School,
then spent a year at Bullis Prep. When
Canfield won the W&L coaching as-
signment, Perreault was his first re-
cruit,

He has been a fan favorite all
year, and a starter since W&L’s ninth
game, but often has been inaccurate—
he hit only three of 19 against Roa-
noke a week ago—and has taken many
shots he should not have. He had nev-
er scored in double figures.

Last night the Generals returned
to their losing ways as Roanoke Col-
lege downed W&L 85-75. The game
was close throughout with Roanoke
leading by three at halftime at 36-33.
The game was tied 11 times.

Larry Perreault led General scorers
for the second straight time, netting
21 points. He was followed by Dick
Livingston with 20, and Fred Mindel
and Steve Sweitzer both with ten.
John Mongero led Roanoke with 18.

Perreault scored Tuesday on 13 of
19 shots for 30 points, stole the ball
10 times and had five assists.

When Old Dominion took an early |
lead, it was Perreault that caught the
Generals afire—he scored 11 points
in the first eight minutes. When the
Monarchs went into a second half full
court press, it was Perreault that
broke it. When they pulled within two
points late in the game, it was a pair
of Perreault free throws that ended
the threat.

Perreault called it “just a lucky
game,” and credited the rebounding of
Spessard and Livingston. Nevertheless,
his 30-point total was nine points bet- |
ter than he had ever done in high)
school.

Tuesday, along with a multitude of
other morale-boosting signs, Canfield |,
had blocked the locker room doorway |g
with a roll of tape that read, “Cross.
over the line.” He had been telling
his players all year that there was an)

“invisible line” beyond which they |
hadn’t gone but were capable of go-
ing. They finally went.

Generals play at home Tuesday
against R.P.1., which won first meet-|
ing, 101-77 ... Canfield credited cheer- |
ing section under basket—the Delt)
freshman—with part of Tuesday's |
win... .Less than 200 fans showed up

 

 

 

 

 

Va. Episcopal, Mennonite
Defeat Frosh Cage Team

It looks like the Washington and
Lee freshman basketball team will
wind up the season with a_ perfect
record.

The baby Generals kept their perfect
record intact with these two most re-
cent losses to Virginia Episcopal and
Eastern Mennonite. Their record is
now 0-9.

Against Virginia Episcopal the final
score was 68-51. The Generals were
never in contention in the game as
five Episcopal players scored in double
figures. W&L had the game’s high
scorer however, in the person of Cor-
bet Bryant who netted 14. High for
Episcopal was Heald with 12.

Moving into their next game against
Eastern Mennonite on Tuesday, the
W&L frosh were completely outclas-
sed in the first half but then came
on to stay fairly even with Mennonite
in second half scoring. This in spite
of the fact that Mennonite kept their
first string in for most of the game.

The score at half time had been 39-
25 in favor of Mennonite. In second
half scoring, it was 31 for W&L and
34 for Eastern Mennonite. Four of
their players and one W&L man fin-
ished in double figures. High scorer of
the game was Mennonite’s Beiler with
25. Yoder followed with 18. W&L was

‘led by Bill Rasmussen with 14.

The baby Generals face just two
more foes this season. This afternoon
they go against Greenbrier here and
on Monday afternoon they go against
Virginia Episcopal in a game there.

O DC; Loses to Roanoke

 

By TOM WHITE

An old nemesis and a newcomer to
the schedule are the competition this
weekend as the Washington and Lee
wrestling team faces two out-of-
town matches.
| The old nemesis is Franklin and
|| Marshall, whom W&L has never beat-
en, The newcomer is Loyola of Balti-
more. Last year, in the most recent
meeting between the two schools,
Franklin and Marshall defeated the
W&L grapplers by a 19-9 score.

This year not much is known about
the Pennsylvania school, who the
Generals will meet there Friday night.
They have had four meets this year,
but only scores from two of the meets
are available.

They defeated Harvard in a close
match by a 15-14 score, and they lost
| to Columbia in another close match.
The score in that one was 17-14.

See Chances as 50-50

Coach Dick Miller says W&L has
a “50-50 chance to win this one.” Top
| wrestlers for F&M are Schneiderman
| at heavyweight, Donovan at 167, and
| Kistler at 147.

Miller bases his estimate on W&L
chances against F&M on the fact that
W&L has strengthened itself consid-
erably since last year’s loss. Last year

 

Shown above are Larry Perreault on the left and Dick Livingston on the} W&L was in an awkward position
right, Perreault paced Generals in win over Old Dominion with 30 points| since Coach Miller had to end up ref-

while Livingston had 22.

Wrestlers Face FRM and Loyola;
Make Two Changes In Line Up

Only two changes in the starting line
up are contemplated for this week-
end’s matches. Bob Payne, a freshman,
will replace Kemble White at 137
pounds and Don Patterson, a sopho-
more, will replace Tom Stover at 147.

Coach Miller said the decision to
insert Payne in the lineup was made
after he beat out White two days run-
ning in practice matches this week.
Patterson will replace Stover because
the PiKA senior has to take his law
boards exams this Saturday.

Miller praised Patterson as a good
wrestler who will do well. He added,
however, that he lacks some of the
ability that Stover’s experience gives
him.

Optimistic Against Loyola

Turning to the meet against Loyola
of Baltimore, Miller was optimistic as
to the outcome, although he added that
not too much was known about their
squad. That match will be held Sat-
urday afternoon there.

The only foe common to both teams
is Hampden-Sydney. Both squads
have defeated that school, but the
Loyola victory was a close one while
the Generals defeated H-S by a 30-3
score.

The Generals go into the weekend's
two meets with a 6-1 record overall.
The only loss was to West Virginia
just before the Christmas break. After
this weekend’s matches, W&L has only
two meets remaining, on February 20
against Old Dominion there and on
February 27 against U.Va. here.

 

NOTICE

There will be a brief meeting of
SPEPOOJCA tomorrow night at 11:00
in Mr. Jennings’ Office to familiarize
members with the rules of the group’s
latest creation, “jaggling.”

the same three teams were in the

playoff was such a dogfight last year
that each team lost once in the finals

If you can persuade her to take two
overnights, the IFC will provide her
transportation. Buses are leaving the
girl’s schools on Friday at 2:00 p.m.
and will return to them on Sunday
at 4:00 p.m. The reason for the change
in scheduling is VMI Mid-winters.

Hibbard emphasized that the buses
leave Sunday, NOT Saturday night.

Amid placards reading, ‘The Worst
thing since Petty Pants” and “Girls
aren’t Mummies,” the board members
for the Ban the Body Stocking League
received an encouraging progress re-
port last night. It seemed to indicate
that their devoted effort of the past
two months is paying off. “If present
trends continue” the report read, “the
body stocking will have lost all sup-
port by June of this year.” After last
night’s meeting one board member
commented that it was a successful
meeting, but not as successful as last
week’s when the body stocking was
modeled.

FASHIONS

BY 0. E. SCHOEFFLER, esauine’s Fashion Director
THE LAST HURRAH for 1964 is now an echo. The last Christmas

tree has been piled on a blazing bonfire, and your New Year’s reso-
lutions have already had a chance to stand the test of time. One
resolution every alert college man should make (and keep) is to
look his best at all times. With this thought in mind, let’s take a
quick checkup on your mid-winter wardrobe.

CHESTNUTS ROASTING ON AN OPEN FIRE, and you warm and

fashionable in your camelhair sweater—an ideal mid-winter pic-
ture. The camelhair sweater is showing a marked popularity this
year on campuses across the country. And again, cardigans cap top
honors, both in button-front and shawl-collar models, and in smart
border stripes. Look for the new cardigans zipped and border-
striped up the front and leather patched on the
sleeves. A continuing favorite is the Shetland
pullover in soft heathery shades of muted blue,
brown and tan with a “brushed surface” effect
in both crew and V-neck styles.

WALKIN’ IN A WINTER WONDERLAND, or
skiing down the powdery white slopes, you'll find
the “Ski Look” influence in the HOOT Sweater.
The turtleneck identifies the HOOT. A high-
standing, fold-over turtleneck of rugged rib-
knit, or a “mock” turtle—the high crew-neck—
gives the HOOT a handsome, masculine look.
Heavier, bulkier yarns, and bold patterns, especially the Seandina-
vian designs, are the thing. Brilliant blues, greens, reds and golds
in solid or multi-colored combination stripes and argyles make the
HOOT Sweater an eye-catching invigorating new campus fashion
HOOT Slacks in tan and bronze corduroy are tapered, trim and
pleatiess, and coordinate perfectly with all ingredients of the HOOT
LOOK,

BABY, It’s COLD OUTSIDE! But with the proper accessories, you

won't have to worry about the outside weather story. Gloves, often
ignored by college men, are much more than hand-warmers; they
are an integral part of the fashion picture. Sturdy pigskin in the
natural “cork” shade with linings of lambswool or fur are favored
on the cold-weather campus, as are tan knitted woo! gloves with
leather palma. Crisp and correct are woolen mufflers in solid colors
or bold Tartan designs. In scarves, the knitted cross stripes or
border stripes have the edge.

Policy Is

Meeting

that as a result of this it was unable
to speculate on the opinions of the
remainder of the students. Basing its
assumptions on data gathered by the
poll, the EC endeavored to discov-
er a meaningful concensus. A variety
of possible proposals were put for-
ward, but these lacked complete en-
dorsement.

Referendum Sub-Committee Formed

In an effort to fully explore the
relevance of the referendum and to
place it in the context of the entire
student body, a sub-committee was
formed to handle this comprehensive
study plan. The EC will continue full
discussion of the issue pending the
report of this group.

Several members of the EC em-
phasized the “tremendous amount of
importance attached to the conven-
tional dress issue.” They furthe1
stated that the ultimate purpose of
the study was to reconcile the tra-
dition of conventional dress and the
Assimilation Committee with the
reality of campus opinion.

The obvious concern of the EC for
this matter is illustrated by its in-
tention to act on the issue as quick-
ly as possible. A definite statement
of policy will be presented to the
student body in order to eliminate
widespread misconceptions.

Publications Budget Discussed

In other action Jim De Young,
| chairman of the student finance com-
mittee, submitted a semi-annual re-
port on the financial condition of
the EC, Calyx, Southern Collegian,
|Mock Convention Committee, and
the Ring-tum Phi. The other mem-
bers of the committee are, Jerry
Turner, Fred Mindel, Mark Apple-
feld, and Mr. Rayder of the Rock-
bridge National Bank.

Thus far the EC has totaled ex-
penditures of $193 which represents
a budget surplus if present trends
continue. The Calyx which also
shows a budget surplus at this point
has not yet achieved its advertising
goal. With a budget surplus of $150
and one of the strongest advertising
programs in recent years, the South-
ern Collegian maintains a stable fi-
nancial position. Although the Ring-
tum Phi has a budget deficite of $284,
the EC decided to take no action in
hopes the various difficulties which
have beset the publication will work
themselves out.

Politics and Student Government

If the status quo in campus politics lasts through next
spring or longer, there may be serious damage to student
government. The present situation is normal for W&L
insofar as the existence of an overwhelming majority
party is concerned; but it is something new that the fra-
ternities not‘included in the majority are not even organ-
ized into a party. It is something new, and something
dangerous for the existence of an effective student govern-
ment.

If, as is now possible, the University Party nominates
candidates who are unopposed by candidates of another
party, there will be no doubt as to the results; the Uni-
versity Party will, by nominating candidates, be electing
officers. In other words, student body officers will be elect-
ed not by campus vote, but by Clique representatives, the
University Party wheels. Such a system of selecting stu-
dent body officers will have two particularly harmful ef-
fects on student politics: first, it will mean that on many
occasions the best men will have no substantial chance
of being elected; second, it will destroy interest in and
competition for student body offices, and thus eventually
undermine student government itself.

The possibility of any improvement under something
like the present party system is not encouraging. Party
history in the last several years has been a story of switch,
collapse, and start again: four years ago the University
Party held an unapproachable majority over the hapless
Independent Party. This began to dissatisfy some campus
politicians, who formed the Progressive Party, which held
a majority for one election. Then the University Party
made a brief return to power, only to fall before the
formation of the Liberty Party, which began the present
school year with ten houses. The Liberty Party, however,
didn’t even last through its first election; discontent-
ed with its nominations for freshman EC, some of the
Clique members revived the University Party, which then
elected its freshman EC nominee and now commands the
enviable position of being unopposed.

Despite this history of instability, the present frame-
work offers the only possible immediate solution to the
dilemma we face: let the nine houses who are presently un-
affiliated with a party join together in opposition to the
Big Clique. The new party would not be close to a major-
ity, but it would have a chance of electing candidates if
they were outstanding nominees. At least such a minority
would prevent the unopposed election of University Party
men, and by opposing, force the party Big Clique to em-
ploy some care in picking its nominees.

If such a new party were formed, it would be a vast
improvement over the status quo. However, the basic
problems of campus politics would remain untouched.
Whereas a two-party system would at least allow the stu-
dent body a real vote, it would not prevent each party
from nominating candidates on the old principle of
“whose turn it is this year” among the houses of the
party. A two-party system cannot prevent campus poli-
ticians from nominating candidates with fraternities in
mind, with Rush Week impressions in mind, instead of
student government in mind.

What is a better answer? We aren't sure. It should be
an answer which holds out as its end effective student
government, rather than the proper schedule for the
gravy train. We appeal to the Executive Committee to
consider a solution. We appeal to students at large to
propose a system which might work fairly. We appeal to
members of the faculty who have known better methods
of electing student governments than the W&L system,
to explain them to students. And finally, we appeal to the
fraternity Clique representatives to reason together to-
ward a more fair political system at W&L.

 

Support for Ariel

One of the best arguments (and possibly there are
few) that the Washington and Lee student body is ser-
iously interested in a liberal arts education, is the exist-
ence of Ariel, its literary magazine. Ariel is W&L’s only
outlet for student literary expression; as student maga-
zines go, faculty members say that it compares favorably
with almost any in the country. It is all the more regret-
table then, that Ariel is on the verge of ceasing publica.
tion because of its lack of support.

To save Ariel, the English Department could con-
ceivably be asked to pitch in with relief. Or, the student
government could be asked to consider granting funds
to Ariel, which has seemed to many to be more worthy
of receiving student body funds than the Southern Col-
legian. These solutions, however, since they would put
Ariel under foreign control, are rightly looked on by the
magazine's editors as last resorts. A student literary pub-
lication should not be under the thumb of the faculty, and
neither should it be subject to the flow of campus polli-
tics,

The very need for such outside support for Ariel
is something of an indictment of the Washington and Lee
student body, The magazine has been published for only
several years; it has consistently contained good work
and it has been edited in good taste. Yet already it is falt-
ering, it is close to failing. Surely we can do better than
this in responding to work of the quality of Ariel. It is
on sale at a number of spots all over the campus; if you
haven't read Ariel, pick up a copy.

“Where Did We Go Wrong???

 

Roy Tyler Replies to Chaplain’s Attack
On School; Says Girls Must Share Blame

ByROY TYLER
Though I have not spent a great
deal of time in the Hollins chapel
in the last two and a half academic
years, I have on occasion, heard Dr.

Alvord Beardslee speak. He is a
rather young man; a man most
everyone would like, and a man

everyone can easily talk to.

His letter to last Friday's Ring-
tum Phi has caused a great deal of
comment, mostly bad, of course,
about what he had to say.

First of all, “The” University, to
Virginians is not always meant to be
the University of Virginia. With this
in mind, let us continue.

My opinion of what Dr. Beardslee
is attempting to do, is a favorable
one. He feels that the grossness and
the immature behavior has gone too
far at Washington and Lee. But, let
me ask one thing, are those who
“ ..vomit inte our chapel, relieve

themselves in our parking lot...”
merely Washington and Lee stu-
dents?

Are there more W&L students who
do this than other students?

Granted, there is a great deal of
behavior that should not go on, but
the fraternities are not, as Dr.
Beardslee implies and has, on other
occasions, said; the source of all
the “trouble.” W&L is a fraternity
school and W&L students contribute
a great deal to the type of “moral
decay” Dr. Beardslee criticizes; but
I have seen students from Virginia
Tech and even some junior colleges
in the area perform some of the
most outlandish acts of repulsion I
have ever seen.

A great deal of the blame, I be-
heve, lies not in fraternities but in
the girls’ schools themselves. There
are certain “groups” of girls who
delight in the activities of the, as Dr.

Beardslee terms them, “...slack-
bellied, loose-lipped golden drunks.”
These girls gather in the dorms be-
hind doors on Sunday night (usually
after hearing Dr. Beardslee at
Chapel) and try and outdo each
other concerning the grossness of
their weekend dates.

These girls are the ones who stand
around and laugh when one of their
friends (who is just not “with it”)
gets a trash can full of garbage
dumped on her head or is bitten by
a “mad” student. The more the girls
think this great comedian’s actions
are, the more he will continue to
perform. He might even request a
a repeat performance which she, of
course, accepts.

But, what if she turns him down?
Is she condemned to attend the Fri-
day and Saturday night showing of
Friendly Persuasion, originally film-

bright pink, ‘65 Porsche glides to

Welcome W&L Alumni. Inside the
car are two people. One is an in-
credibly corpulent man of about
fifty-five, dressed in a sharkskin
suit, Countess Mara tic, Weejuns.
Sitting next to him is a person who
appears to be his twin brother, but
is in reality his son. The boy is
equally fat and similarly dressed,
wearing a pair of thick, chrome-
rimmed glasses. As the pair gets
out of the car, two students ap-
proach, then stop to stare.

Ist Student: Hey, pretty fat beel you

his hand along back fender)

Alum: Fat?

2nd Student: Yeah. Real fat wheels.

Alum: (smiling, putting his hand on
his son’s shoulder) Are you two

Ist Student; No bird. What's the
scoop?

Alum: Gentlemen, my name is Hor-
ace Fabsmacher—W&L ’34—and
this is my son, Leonard. He plans
to attend here next year.

2nd Student: That's close. I’m the
Gnat. This is Booboo,

Alum: How do you do? I brought
Leonard up so he could take a
look at the fraternities and decide
which one is best for him.

Ist Student: Man, you're not sparin’
us any pain at all, are you? Don’t
take offense, but the kid’s got

WEL-Hollins Study Group

 

Question of the ‘Educated’ Choice Explored

By JOUN KIRKLEY

Why do we come to college?

In the discussion group between
Washington and Lee and Hollins last
Friday night, the
freshmen answer-
ed this question
with reasons like
these: because it’s
expected of us by
our parents and
society; because no
matter what one
wants to do event-
tually, he needs a
college degree to
do it; beeause of
the “earning pow-
degree; because |

er’ of a college

wanted to meet new people who held
ideas different from mine; because I
want to be a doctor (or teacher or
lawyer); because I want to find
something or learn something—the
answer to various questions or prob-
lems.

Note the variety of these answers.
Most of them would probably be
mentioned sooner or later during a

similar discussion—or in ordinary
conversation with any college
ireshman in the country. In faet,

most of us have thought of all these
reasons at one time or another. Yet
most of us will, if pressed, say that
we came here to learn something or
“get an education.” And what is it
that we do learn at college? What

is it that we are actually taught?
We could begin to answer by
enumeration: we learn some history,
some science, some English.... Or
we could say we learn facts; but
to answer the question, “Facts about
what?”, we would probably turn
to the subjects again. Or we might
answer: we learn how to think. How
to handle ideas. And isn’t this really
what we are “supposed” to learn?
Something about points of view.

In English we learn to see a situa-
tion in a novel from the point of
view of each of the main characters,
or to see the novel from the point
of view of a variety of critics. In
sociology we learn the facts that all
men have in common certain biologi-
eal, social, and psychological needs,
but also that different groups of men
(different cultures) go about meet-
ing or satisfying these needs in a
variety of ways. In the sciences we
see that, from practically any theo-
retical problem, there are a variety
of theories purporting to solve it. We
learn that men have held different
philosophies, that there a number of
ways of interpreting history, that
Keynes viewed economic problems
in a way different from Mill. And so
forth

What we learn is this: that for any
given situation or problem there
are a number of solutions or an-
swers. We can approach the problem
from different points of view: and,
depending on what our particula
point of view is, we might solve it
in different ways

But why are we taught this? What
is the orientation, the point of view
that would have this as the goal of
a lengthy educational process?

Isn't the view of man that that
would support this educational goal
something like this: man is essen-
tisily a problem-selving creature
continually thrown into a variety of
sittations which unique and
which involve him in contact with
his world and other persons; and
what he should do in each situation
is perceived thal there are a num-
of ways of thinking or acting or be-
having in this situation; finally, he
should do what is best in each situa-
ton

But then the question each of us
must ask himself is this
that is best te do?

Our culture provides us a great
variety of answers, including many
forms of religious, ethical, moral, or
political fundamentalism, to the
problem we all face: “What is best
to do—here, now?”

We are taught to see the answers,
the variety of possible solutions. But

Congratulations To Us
To the Editor:

Outlined against a star-studded
sky last Tuesday night, the nine
studs of W&L ‘hooped it up. They
are being congratulated on their fine
efforts which teemed with good plays,
and especially for their win over
Old Dominion. The size of the crowd
was truly heartwarming, especially
in view of the fact that the athletic
support is often next to none

Anyway, congratulations boys, you

medley relay, Nelson Head did a
fine leg of the 100-yard backstroke
in 1:03 minutes as did his fellow
freshman Kester Denman with a
time of 1:06 in the 100-yard breast-
stroke.

Co-captain Andy Broaddus went
a minute flat for the butterfly and
anchorman Gary Bokinsky wrapped
up the final 100-yard freestyle to
give W&L a lead that was never
threatened. Bart Taylor, usually a
sprinter, followed with a second in
the 200-yard freestyle, while co-
captain Chase won the 50-yard free-
style as did Bill Wildrick in the 200-
yard individual.

Noel Clinnard and Rich Stevens
took second and third in the diving,
and Broaddus followed with a win
in the 200-yard butterfly after his

of |

victorious teammate was disqualified. |
| Next came Bart Taylor, who turned
lin his best time for the 100-yard|
ifreestyle with 55.6.
| Head repeated with a fine time of|
}2:22 in the 200-yard backstroke as|
'did Denman in the 200-yard breast- |
istroke. Bill Wildrick won the 500-!
yard freestyle and Generals’ Broad-
dus, Busse, Clay, and Huston won
the final 400-yard freestyle relays.

Encouraged by the fine perfor-
manees, Coach Eastman looked
hopefully for a repeat against power-
ful American, but the Generals were
flat. The opening medley relay went
uncontended to W&L, but AU.
swept the 200-yard freestyle, the 50-
yard freestyle, 200-yard individual
and diving, thus swamping the Gen-
erals.

W&L managed only one legitimate
first place with Kester Denman in
the 200-yard breaststroke. Bill Wild-
rick lost a close race in the 200-yard
butterfly, and the Generals won the
400-yard freestyle relay via forfeit.

This Saturday the Generals will
conclude their season against weak
Georgetown. It will definitely be a
record day with special attention}
on the 200-yard freestyle or butter-|
fly depending on Wildrick, the 100-
yard freestyle, the 200-yard individ-
ual medley, the 200-yard back-
strocke, and the final 400-yard
freestyle relay.

I received many comments from

were even comments about my state-

a big asset on a basketball team of
greater stature than the one for
which he is starring now.

Two former high school players
who participated for the freshman
team two years ago said they thought
I was exaggerating Livingston's abil-

basketball authorities? Anyway, it

The Washington and Lee varsity wrestling team invaded
the North this weekend, splitting two matches to run its rec-
ord to 7-2. Franklin and Marshall handed the W&L matmen
a 14-13 defeat on Friday, but the Generals sprang back a night
later to trample Loyola of Baltimore, 27-5.

At Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Butch West got the Generals
off to a good start with a 6-1 victory*§—————————

the 123 pound class. At 130, however,
Dick Musick suffered his first loss

came through in fine style, winning
10-3. F&M evened the match again
George Schnyder edged Don
Patterson, 3-2. The match remained
even as W&L’s Jamie Andrews and
Chuck Geddes struggled to a 1-1
deadlock.

At 167 co-captain Peter Winfield
recorded his third pin of the sea-
son at 1:32 of the final period, giv-
ing the W&L grapplers a 13-8 edge.

Minks B-Ball

The Varsity Club at Washington
and Lee under the leadership of its
President, Butch West, will sponsor
the annual Faculty-Student basket-
ball game at 7:30 on the night of
February 22. Each fraternity as well
as the Independent Union will send
one representative to be on the stu-
dent team coached by Gordan Gay,
a member of Delta Tau Delta.

Dr. Shillington will assume his
regular position as coach of the fac-
ulty team which will consist primar-
ily of those members of the academ-
ic faculty who wish to participate;
“those with special talents as show-
men, gamesmanship, or ability are
being especially solicited” says Coach
Lee McLaughlin, who is aiding the
Varsity Club in coordinating the af-
fair.

The price of admission will $1.00
per person, and the proceds will be
employed towards “some pressing
need in the Athletic Department.”
Coach Norman Lord and Buddy
Deaver will serve referees be-
eause of their ability as showmen
well as referees. Although the
Faculty has managed to win in the
past—that is with a litle help from
the referees, the game should prove
amusing and quite enjoyable.

company which finishes the year with
the highest parade rating is awarded
special recognition.

On April 28, 1965, the most import-

ODK Leadership
Wednesday On Self-Study Plan

(Continued from page 1)

The Self-Study Program has been
designed primarily to allow “an ap-
praisal to be made of the University’s
current strengths and opportunities
for immediate and future improve-
ment,” and also to encourage “recom-
mendations for change to be formu-
lated and implemented now and in
the future.” The program is to last
for approximately eighteen months.

Edward C. Atwood, Dean of

Students and member of the Self-

Study Committee, explained the

program as “a comprehensive sur-

vey of all aspects of Washington
and Lee. It will include not only
the academic field, but also stu-
dent organizations and extracurri-
cular facilities, as well.” Dean At-
wood also made clear the fact that
the program is aimed not only to-
ward immediate change, but also
will hopefully project into the fu-
ture. He stated that “the program

Here, I believe, is the problem.
Do girls have to change their atti-
tude concerning toleration before
the boys will change the actions
they are tolerating? Or will the boys
change their actions, thereby leaving
no reason for the girls to change?
One might as well argue “... what
comes first, the chicken or the egg?”
But merely because fraternities
exist and merely because certain
things which should not go on with-
in them do go on, is no reason for
their dissolvement. A great deal of
the “trouble” encountered by Hol-
lins girls could be avoided by the
girls themselves. If you destroy the
source of the problem, you would
destroy the problem; but you would
have to destroy the student body of
all area colleges, not merely frater-
nities and not merely the W&L stu-
dent body, to destroy the source.

 

   

 

 

 

BY 0. E. SCHOEFFLER, esauire’s Fashion Director
THE LAST HURRAH for 1964 is now an echo. The last Christmas

tree has been piled on a blazing bonfire, and your New Year's reso-
lutions have already had a chance to stand the test of time. One
resolution every alert college man should make (and keep) is to
look his best at all times. With this thought in mind, let’s take a
quick checkup on your mid-winter wardrobe.

CHEST NUTS ROASTING ON AN OPEN FIRE, and you warm and

fashionable in your camelhair sweater—an ideal mid-winter pic-
ture. The camelhair sweater is showing a marked popularity this
year on campuses across the country. And again, cardigans cap top
honors, both in button-front and shawl-collar models, and in smart
border stripes. Look for the new cardigans zipped and border-
striped up the front and leather patched on the

sleeves. A continuing favorite is the Shetland
pullover in soft heathery shades of muted blue, :
brown and tan with a “brushed surface” effect *\.

in both crew and V-neck styles,

WALKIN’ IN A WINTER WONDERLAND, or
skiing down the powdery white slopes, you'll find
the “Ski Look” influence in the HOOT Sweater.
The turtleneck identifies the HOOT. A high-
standing, fold-over turtleneck of rugged rib-
knit, or a “mock” turtle—the high crew-neck—

fs)

    

fives the HOOT a handsome, masculine look.

ileavier, bulkier yarns, and bold patterns, especially the Seandina-
vian designs, are the thing. Brilliant blues, greens, reds and golds
in solid or multi-colored combination stripes and argyles make the
HOOT Sweater an eye-catching invigorating new campus fashion.
HOOT Slacks in tan and bronze corduroy are tapered, trim and
pleatiess, and coordinate perfectly with all ingredients of the HOOT

LOOK.

BABY, IT’S COLD OUTSIDE! But with the proper accessories, you
won't have to worry about the outside weather story. Gloves, often
ignored by college men, are much more than hand-warmers; they
are an integral part of the fashion picture. Sturdy pigskin in the
natural “cork” shade with linings of lambawool or fur are favored
on the cold-weather campus, as are tan knitted wool gioves with
leather palms, Crisp and correct are woolen mufflers in solid colors
or bold Tartan designs, In scarves, the knitted cross-atripes or

border stripes have the edge.

Hinton

The Washington and Lee Self-
Study Program, subject of the ODK
Leadership Forum conducted Wed-
nesday night, was introduced by Dr.
William Hinton, chairman of the
study. Hinton opened his brief ex-
planation of the program by saying,
“The responsibility for this self-study
lies with the University. Unless
those involved receive full support
of the Washington and Lee Family,
the self-study will not be able to
fulfill the requirements of such an
analysis.”

The official reason for the study is
not only to fulfill the requirements
of the Southern Association of Col-
leges, but also to produce something
which will serve as a guide to a
productive future, he stated.

Hinton outlined the structure of
the self-study program, emphasiz-
ing the role of the steering com-

mittee into which he said other
committees would funnel their
findings. In getting everyone in-

volved in such a program, you
create a wide base of responsibility
and interfere less with the various
duties of the faculty and admin-
istration.

tives of the University—its philoso-
phy of education, its needs, and its
aims. Various members of the steer-
ing committee have drawn up state-
ments, tentative in nature, and sub-
ject to the revision of the commit-
tee as a whole.

The steering committee found it
necessary to set up several sub-
committees to deal with such facets
of the university as the honors
program, pre-medical curriculum,
grades (on this committee, Hinton
said, quite a bit of use had been
made of student opinion), leave of
absence policy, alumni evaluation of
a W&L edueation, and class sched-
uling. Hinton emphasized that the
faculty was in the same stage of
ignorance concerning the self-study
in late November as the student
body is now. He went on to say that
student involvement was less easily
obtained than faculty involvement.
More student involvement is needed,
he felt.

“If I’ve given you nothing but the
feel of the self-study, this meeting
has been successful. The self-study
goes beyond the requirements of
accreditation into the future of
W&L.” Hinton concluded before the

meeting was opened for questions
from the floor.

The first question to come up
concerned the place Lee College
was to fit into the self-study. Hin-
ton answered by saying that the
proposed extension didn’t come in-
to consideration at present; how-
ever, he did say that if the needs
are sufficient, they might suggest
expansion in such a direction.

in answering to questions con-
cerning the availability of the results
of the analysis, Hinton said that the
final draft would of course be avail-
able and that tentative results might
be discussed at some future meeting.

Dean W. W. Pusey, a member of
the steering committee, stated that
students would be brought into com-
mittees in areas where student opin-
ion is important. These committees
have not yet gotten underway.

It was brought out that both Dean
Atwood and President Cole have
had experience in compiling self-
studies at other schools in the past.

In answer to a question as to
whether any opinions of the sub-
committees had come in yet, Hin-
ton replied that there had been
few. Dr. Wise pointed out that such

 

tentative opinions might not neces-
sarily be open information.

Troubadour Review

Critic Hann

By WILLIAM F. HANNUM, I

The Troubadour Theatre presentation of Henrik Ibsen's

vigorous positive response from its

audience. Such a response should be especially gratifying in light of
the fact that the play is difficult to wrest from its topical late 19th century

frame of reference. Dr. Cecil Jones, the Troubadours’

director, has clearly

succeeded in delivering the play of its explosive universal force, the ever-
lasting ironical conflict between different kinds of truth, without allow-

ing its Mid-Victorian socio-political

trappings to interfere.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-twm Phi

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

Friday Edition

Administrative Responsibility

Administrative responsibility at neighboring girls’ schools
includes the behavior of girls’ dates and punishing any behavior
which that college regards as improper. In most cases, the ad-
ministrations themselves take action, they call in the police if
necessary, and finally report such misconduct to the respective
men’s schools, W&L, UVa., Hampden-Sydney, etc., for their

action.

However, the W&L administration seems to feel as though
we are all “Virginia gentlemen,” and that all students’ dates
are “Shenandoah belles.” Even if the girl is six-five, weighs
two-twenty, and is totally uncontrollable after one scotch and
water, it is the student’s responsibility to see that her ladyship
never misbehaves in public. So the girl, after knocking out a
few windows or charging down the street drunk or emerging
from the fraternity house like a modern Eve, misbehaves. It’s
not her fault; she’s a lady. Instead, the responsibility lies with
the man; he’s the villain. Girls are incapable of misbehaving
or of encouraging misbehavior. It is, however, the fraternity
that’s put on social probation; it’s the man who suffers. Not
that the W&L man is any Sir Philip Sidney, but the responsi-

bility is not his alone.

The point, though, is that the administration accepts no
responsibility for the conduct of girls who date at W&L on
weekends. When asked by an official of one our neighbor-

ing schools what would happen if one of their students was
found weaving up and down the street drunk at two in the*
morning, one of our administrative officers replied that the
case would not be reported to the girls’ school, nor would any
action other than possibly from the Lexington police force be

taken against the girl.

The responsibility for controlling his date’s conduct does:

lie with the boy, but sometimes the girls’ misbehavior is not his
fault. This must be taken into consideration. It is not always

the boy or the fraternity that should be punished.
It may be that one reason W&L is so much criticized is be-
cause W&L men are held responsible for both their dates

Beardslee Questions Fraternity S ystem

not forward change.

How could I explain to this

For the former there is a severe pen-

Faculty Stars
Clash With IM
Stars Monday

By TOM WHITE

On the theory ‘that you can’t lose
‘em all, the 1965 edition of the intra-
mural basketball all stars has be-
gun to practice for its meeting next
Monday night at 7:30 with the facul-
ty stars.

To refresh your memory just a bit,
the IM stars last year were humiliat-
ed by the faculty in a game where
the scorekeeper was pretty much on
his own. He introduced a_ helpful
rule wherein faculty baskets counted
twice as much as student baskets.
Naturally, no accurate record of the
score was kept.

Anyway, hope springs eternal in
the human breast and IM coach Gor-
don Gay reports an enthusiastic
bunch showed up for last night's
first practice session. The starting
line up is still not known on the
IM side. However, coach Gay has a
good selection to choose from.

Sixteen houses have already se-
lected their representatives for the
game (each house gets to pick one
of its IM players). At the time of
this writing the players were: Beta,
Tom Burton; Delt, Lindsey Short;
DU, Chuck Boggs; KA, Skip Chase;

—, Lambda Chi, Dick Drew; Phi Delt,

: . peers P ee g | Barry Crosby; Phi Ep, Brax Tabb;
Spring Football Practice Underway; 27 Lettermen > ‘irzeairgn Pees Be:

Among 58 Candidates For Varsity Squad Positions

Phi Gam, John Morgan; Phi Psi, Bob

Dick Bradford; Sigma Nu, Buck
Clement; SPE, Roy Stallings; and
ZBT, Ron Laupheimer.

No word has been received from

|coach Shillington yet on the exact

make up of the faculty squad. How-
ever, some greats of the past in-
cluding the likes of Dean John, Dean
Atwood, Dr. Emmons, Dr. Cook, and
Mr. Hannum are expected to mak
the liniment squad. It is hoped that
a few more will brave the student
catealls to do their best.

Impartially officiating the contest
will be two of the most popular and
able area officials, coach Norm Lord
and Buddy Deaver. They have prom-
ised to be fair toward both sides

Admission for the game will be on«
dollar. Proceeds will go to the P.E
department for use on some project
deemed to be worthwhile. Right now
it looks as if the money will be used
to help finance a new scoreboard for
the football field.

Last year between five and six
hundred dollars was raised by the
game. Proceeds from last year’s game
went to pay for an original member-
ship for Washington and Lee in the
basketball hall of fame. Last year's
game was the first in this current
series.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi
The Ring-tum Phi is published Tuesday and Friday during the college
year. It is printed by the Journalism Laboratory Press, Washington and
Lee University. The mailing address is Box 899, Lexington, Virginia.
Entered as second class matter September 20, 1946 at the Post Office,
Lexington, Virginia, under the act of March 3, 1878.

Editor-in-Chief Business Manager

 

Ring-tum Phi Play Review
(Continued from Page 1)

Duvall gives a sensitive performance of filial dedication in the violent
crisis of the final act, and Miss Prohaska is consistently poised and ef-
fective as the sincere, perceptive Petra.

The gentlemen of the press, vox populi, are quite well played by Jay
Hight, Lew Davis and Bob Hudson. Mr. Hight, as the moderate Mr.
Aslaksen, publisher of the town’s newspaper, is winningly self-righteous
and super-cautious, giving a properly restrained and credible performance
in his first major role.

Once again the Troubadour production staff has distinguished itself,
overcoming some obvious physical disadvantages in the theatre to put
together imaginative and functional settings. Our congratulations to
them, and to Dr. Jones, with gratitude for his exceptional energy and
creative ability.

 

Bergman’s ‘The Silence’ Tiring

(Continued from page 2)

She is convinced that she com-
municates with her audience leaving
with it an overpowering sen-
sual feeling. If a horselaugh is
the response growing out of a sen-
sual experience, then I guess she
does. Someone ought to find Ann-
Margaret an Italian lover and ship
her off to Syria to make movies for
the Shell Oil Company, or at least
give her to Walt Disney so that he
can make another nature movie.

Ingmar Bergman’s The Silence is
now playing at the Lyric and is not
at all worth what it costs to see it.
The Silence is the second movie in a
triology, following Through a Glass
Darkly and is not quite up to the
fine first movie. The Silence seems
to be Bergman playing at being

small, well-trained and highly paid
group of professionals. The service
academies are sufficient for provid-
ing the officers for such an army,
and there are enough people who
would choose the military for a ca-
reer to fill up the ranks.

If we consider the soldier as a
weapon, we see that he is a five
times more powerful weapon today
than he was in World War IL. The
soldier, however, while an effective
weapon in Korea or Vietnam or in
any future trouble spot, would not
be of major importance in a large
scale war. If we ever again come
to the point where we have 200,000
men opposing each other, as we did
at the Battle of the Bulge, it will be
no conventional war and nuclear
weapons will take the place of the
soldier in the field.

Inefficient Army

The large army which we maintain
today is outdated and _ inefficient.
Citing from his own personal exper-
ience, Dr. Colvin stated that when
he returned to Ft. Bragg in 1957 to
train guerilla troops, neither he nor
any of his fellow officers had the
vaguest idea how to use the equip-
ment they were given. After two
years in this position, he could only

understand that it amounts to cut-

part of which contains much imagery
essential to the symbolic patterns.
To say that this movie is bad is
unfair to Bergman but to say it is
tiring is fair to the prospective view-
er. Those who are interested in
Bergman flicks will want to see it
for it marks the progression of Ing-
mar Bergman who is one of the truly

So until more funds are provided to

work odd hours, I am afraid my only
suggestion is that students remember
the five areas that remain open when
the stacks are closed during the sup-
per interval and arrange to transfer
some materials when the warning
bell rings each afternoon. I could
ramble on with statistics about the
size of our staff and the unusually

fense. The fact that the draft is al-
ready being phased out is evidenced
by the recent cut in the reserves and
the elimination of ROTC programs
from several university campuses.
Dr. Colvin’s personal feeling is
that this gradual cut down will con-
tinue over the next five years un-
til eventually the Draft Act is re-
pealed. He was quick to add, how-
ever, that his opinion is only an
opinion and that no one should
blame him if the big arm of the draft
were to pick them up in the near
future.

Dave Geer, as well as the manager-
ial swansong of six-year veteran
John Heinzerling.

The General JV’s closed out their
season Wednesday as Lynchburg
beat them 49-45. A disqualification in
the final freestyle relay, one of three
in the meet for W&L, led to the up-
set loss and brought the season rec-
ord down to 4-1.

Taking firsts in the meet for the
Baby Generals were Joe Huston in
the 50 and 100 freestyles, John Thor-
sen in the 200 free, and the medley
relay team of John Baker, Pat Cos-
tello, Bill Clay, and John Ballatine.
Shortly before today’s Ring-tum
Phi went to press, it was learned
that the Georgetown team will not
be able to show up for tomorrow’s
meet due to an epidemic of influenza
in Washington. According to Coach
Eastman, the meet will be resched-

uled for sometime next week.

You see, I don’t attack fraternities
for their painfully unimaginative
dating habits. It takes two to ruin a
date, I guess. No self-respecting wo-
man would go into some of your
houses.

No, I question your pledging prac-
tices. Serious universities have re-
formed this most obvious point of
abuse. I am solemnly assured that
your question cannot change. Let it
die on its feet then, one last noble
posture.

Panel Discusses Fraternities

“the democratic form of a social
organization,” “the ancient free-
doms and particularly the liberty
of the mind with its attendant
right of inquiry,” “the dignity of
the individual,” and “the dignity
of man,” as well as the universi-
ty’s “Christian ideal.”

With this background, the panel
will go on to discuss what respon-
sibilities the fraternity has toward
helping the university live up to
those goals, and what in turn is the
faculty’s and administration’s re-
sponsibility to the fraternity. Special
attention will be paid to the frater-
nity’s own ideals and goals.

Hones System

Changes Asked
By Rick Carrell

Senior EC Representative
Seeks Modified Penalty;
Turner Opposes Change

By MIKE HASH

The Honor System was the
subject of an extensive exam-
ination and reappraisal by the
Executive Committee last eve-
ning. Rick Carrell, senior class
representative to the EC, questioned
the “moral justification” of irrevoc-
able expulsion as a punishment for
honor violations, and asked for a
modification “based on a realistic
approach.”

Carrell Proposes Change
Carrell based his position on the
following three points. “First, we
must recognize that graduations in

honor offenses do exist and must be!

prepared to treat them as such. Sec-
ond, it is unfair both to the student
and to ourselves to permanently ex-
pell a student from our society as
irrevocably dishonest and immoral.
The present system does not allow
the students the right of forgiveness
or the right to redeem himself within
our society.”

“Finally, we must believe in the
two-fold purpose of the University.
The University must guide the stu-
dent's intellectual development and
also guide the student's social and
moral development. Irrevocable ex-
pulsion fails to recognize the social
purpose of the University and denies
this responsibility.”

“Forgiveness” Lacking

In addition Carrell stated that a
one-year suspension would be sufli-
ciently harsh to discourage cheating.
“It would admit forgiveness into the
W&L morality code and allow the
offender to retain his human worth
instead of being branded as a total-
ly dishonorable object.”

In answer to this position Jere
Turner, intermediate law represen-
tative, called for a careful approach
in dealing with the Honor System.
Much of Turner's remarks were
based on a survey conducted by
Columbia University on Student Dis-
honesty and Its Control in College.

Quoting from the survey Turner
said, “One obvious fact is that the
leniency with which academic dis-
honesty is treated on many campuses
may account, at least in part, for
its seriousness student dis-
ciplinary problem.”

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association
Tuesday Edition

A Clean, Efficient System

Last week’s Tuesday editorial criticized campus poli-
tics at Washington and Lee. This week the Ring-tum Phi
presents a plan for reform in campus politics—not under
the illusion that the plan below is the only answer to the
problem, but under the conviction that it is a good plan,
certainly with the knowledge that there is little to be lost
by changing the present situation.

Nine fraternities on this campus have no connection
with a political party. Some of these houses are remaining
independent in hope that a change in the political situation
will eventually enable them to join a strong party. But
others of the independent houses, apparently feeling
that parties are an evil in themselves, idealistically have
said that they will not join any party. These houses would
do much better for themselves and for student government
if, rather than condemning party politics altogether, they
sought to take part in forming a new party system which
would function efficiently and cleanly. Only in a recogni-
tion that parties are inevitable will our political situation
at Washington and Lee be permanently improved.

Our campus political situation demands a change, and
it must be one which embraces the party system—but
controls it. Such a change would be best initiated by the
Executive Committee, with which the primary responsi-
bility for student government rests. An improved system,
if proposed by the Executive Committee, would require
a majority vote of the student body to be incorporated
into the constitution; any change proposed by petition of
the student body would require a two-thirds student ap-
proval.

 

Creation of Elections Committee

A clean and efficient party system might be created
by starting with the division by the Executive Committee
of the eighteen fraternities into two parties as nearly equal
as possible. If the parties were numerically equal—and
this could be ensured by periodic rearrangements of the
parties by the E.C. if necessary—there would be a certain
pressure on both sides to nominate good candidates rather
than paying political debts.

The best way for the parties to nominate would be
through primaries held one or two weeks before general
elections. A good primary system could be set up with
students being eligible to vote in the primary of the party
in which they were members. Non-fraternity and law stu-
dents would be eligible to register with the party of their
choice and vote in that party’s primary.

The most important question to be answered in estab-
lishing a primary system is this: how to make sure that
a free choice of candidates is made available for each party
in the primary voting. The best method of nominating for
the primary would be simply to allow open nominations
from the floor at the same meeting held for the voting.
This would encourage individuals to nominate themselves
or the men they think would be effective officers. At the
same time, it would not rule out pre-primary campaigning
by students who desired to campaign on their own for
the nomination.

Equal Division of the Fraternities

To oversee this process the Executive Committee
could appoint an Elections Committee consisting, perhaps,
of several E.C. seniors plus the chairmen of both par-
ties. This committee could prevent any Clique backing
of a particular candidate prior to his nomination by the
primary; in other words, it would prevent fixed primaries.

The Elections Committee would meet before and
after the primary conventions, and the chairmen of both
parties would testify to the remainder of the committee
that their party Cliques had not met to rig the primaries;
thus free primaries would be certain, An elections Com-
mittee could also act as a “fair practices’ committee dur-
ing election campaigning.

A last measure to keep the old Cliques from controll-
ing the primaries would be open election of party chair-
men in the primaries themselves. There would, no doubr,
still be a Clique, a small group of behind-the-scenes poli-
ticians, but its function would no longer be to nominate
candidates, it would run the campaigns of the men nomi-
nated by the party primaries. This is the area where a
Clique is valuable—in creating an intense campaign in
which issues are debated before the student body. Election
of a Clique chairman by popular vote should change the
Clique from a semi-mysterious nominating body to such a
campaign machine; other Clique members would be elect-
ed representatives of each fraternity or perhaps the presi-
dents of the fraternities.

The Ring-tum Phi proposes this plan in the hope that
the E.C. will consider it and, if the plan is not adopted, at
least take some steps toward reform in student govern-
ment elections. The plan is also proposed with the hope
that the student body will take an interest in campus poli-
tics, stop leaving things to the Cliques, and put pressure
on the E.C. to correct or at least improve the present sit-
uation. In this edition of the newspaper the plan is pre-
sented sketchily, without much argument for its virtues;
next week, if the critics of the plan make themselves
known, there will be debate on its features.

Ring-tum Phi Columnist Kidnaps
‘The Phantom’ Of The Colonnade

Tuesday Columnist

It was three am. I crouched,
waiting in the darkness behind one
of the columns. Tonight was the
night—the night I would catch him
in the act.

All that knew about him was that
he lived in post office box 122, Not
much to go on. There was only one
way to catch the Phantom Writer,
and that was by beating him at his

own game of nighttime hide and
seek.
Somehow I felt sure he would

come. It would be a dangerous, per-
haps even deadly encounter. I was
stiff from cold, my fingers numb,
and yet I had every reason to be-
lieve that my opponent would be
warm (if not overheated), and that

his fingers would be quick and
strong from weeks of relentless
thumbtacking.

Challenges Idea of ‘Absolute Honor’

(The article below, prompted by
current criticism of Honer Systems

since the Air Force Academy
seandal, is one of a pair of articles
re-evaluating the Washington and
Lee Honor System. The answering
article will be printed next week).

By LIN HARTIN

During the past few weeks, the
Air Force Academy has had over one
hundred cadets to “resign” following
the exposure of a rather large cheat-
ing seandal. It seems that a cadet
obtained a copy of examination
questions and with the help of sev-
eral cadets proceeded to sell the
questions to various members of the
corp. The operation was exposed by
two freshmen who felt obliged to re-
port the matter.

The Air Foree Academy has an
honor code very similar to ours here
at Washington and Lee. The cadets

pledge that they “will not lie, cheat,
or steal, or tolerate anyone among
us who does.” As is the case here,
the cadets are honor bound to re-
port any infractions of the code.
The current problem at the Air
Force Academy should arouse sym-
pathy here at Washington and Lee
Contrary to the opinion of one alum-
nus expressed in a letter printed in
this newpaper recently this is by no
means an occasion for Washington
and Lee to pat itself on the back.
We need only recall what we have
been told of the 1953 incident here
to realize that Washington and Lee
was at one time faced with a prob-
lem very similar to that confronting
the Air Force Academy today. It is
not necessary to go into the unpleas-
ant details of this incident, which
really aren't available anyway. It is
sufficient to say that Washington
and Lee and the Air Foree Academy

 

‘Collegian’s’ Navel Policy Vindicated

 

 

suffered a major break-down in their
honor systems.

When one tries to determine why
these breakdowns occured, one must
first face (at Washington and Lee
anyway) certain widely held notions
of “absolute honor.” By absolute
honor I refer to the belief that the
people who make up the student
body of this university (or what-
ever the group in consideration may
be) held identical views of what is
honorable and dishonorable and that,
as a former student body president
put it, one eannot have a little bit
of honor. He must personally sub-
scribe to entire “honor code” or not
be honorable at all.

I challenge this notion completely.
It is best, I think, to consider one’s
obligation under the honor system
as an agreement. When we entered
this university, we all agreed that,

In Ring-tum Phi Poll of Student Body

By STEVE SAUNDERS

Associate Editor
Exposed armpits and naked navels
are the source of genuine concern
here as revealed by the results of
another Ring-tum Phi poll. This
newest sampling of public opinion
was prompted by the negative re-
action reported from some quarters
regarding the assortment of navels
presented in the Fancy Dress issue

of the Southern Collegian.
Of those questioned, 50 per cent
said that they were not in the least
offended by bare navels; 20 per cent

said that they were mildly offended;

10 per cent said that they were
startled: 5 per cent were thoroughly
repulsed; 4 per cent suid they be-

eame violently ill; 2 per eent giggled
and flew off before answering. The

conclusion is obvious. In the future
we just have to keep Collegians
away from those 2 per cent-ers.

A late-night anonymous phone
eall from a man speaking with an
ebviously phony Northern nasal
twang indicated that some dates
might have been offended by the raw
display of carnalism in the Seuthern
Collegian. Seventy-one cent
noted that their dates were offended
in a “pleasant sort of way”; 10 per
eent said that their dates became
hysterical; 9 per cent said that their
dates liked the picture: 4 per cent
said that their dates were in no
eondition to see anything, much less

Office.

The naked armpits which are such
a favorite of sports photographers
have alse come in for criticism. An
unsigned letter postmarked “Hollins,
Va.,” alerted us to the extent of this
criticism. This too was included in
our poll. We asked all these partici-
pating, “De you have anything
against armpits?” The replies ran as
follows. Sixty-three per cent said
“No”; 20 per cent said No, but even
your best friends won't tell you; 10
per cent confessed to having armpits
themselves and therefore asked to
be excused on grounds of bias: 5
per cent said they were opposed to

by me, his eyes alertly forward, and
melted back into the darkness.

What I saw next, you may not be-
lieve: a rope slowly being let out
from the third floor of Payne Hall—-
a shadowy figure sliding down. The
Phantom! I froze as he drew near
the ODK board, unfolded a slip of
paper, and began thumbtacking with
gusto. It was time to spring the
trap.

I crept silently up behind him, po-
tato sack in hand, and with a_ tri-
umphant yell threw the empty bag
over his head. A brief struggle en-
sued, but I had the advantage of
superior strength and eunning and
soon was on the way back to my

apartment with an __ ineffectually
struggling Phantom Writer slung
over my back.

“So this is the illustrious Phon-
tom Writer!” (1 said it as scorn-
fully as possible.) Before me, lying
half in and half out of the burlap
sack, was one of hte gnarfiest, pimp-
liest freshman I have ever seen.
“Boy! you sure are gnarfy and
pimply!” I said mockingly.

He looked up at me, his close-set
little eyes burning red with the
hatred of a cornered rattlesnake.
“Why did you bring me here?” he
hissed, slithering the rest of the way
out of the bag and coliing up against
a couch.

“Let’s just say I was curious to
meet the person who wrote... this,”
I dangled one of his letters in front
of his face. Instantly provoked, he
struck at it, but 1 jerked it away
at the last second, and the Phantom
went sprawling onto the carpet. I
began to read from the letter:

While I was reading, the Phantom
had been staring at my face. Then
suddenly he became very agitated
and began swaying from side to side,
raising himself up on his knees, his
tongue darting in and out, his eyes
glowing. “I know who you are! he

shouted. “You're Crowley! You're
going to put me in the Ring-tum

I sensed that he was about to
strike and that this time I might not
be able to dodge him. Luckily, I
had prepared for just such an oeca-
sion and drew from my belt a
rather large, forked stick. The fresh-
man recoiled in terror, prematurely
shedding his winter skin as he fran-
tically tried to wedge himself under

Fraternity All-Stars Paste
Frolicking Faculty, 38 to 31

It was smacks of Dom Flora at
Doremus Gymnasium last night as
the Intramural All Stars drubbed
the fancy but arthritic Faculty
Stars, 38-31. The event, bolstered by
promise of a PE cut to those who
shelled out the rubles to attend, was
a huge success.

Actually the primary intention was
to raise money for a new football
scoreboard, and while there will be
no Bill Veecks jobs with sirens and
fireworks on Wilson Field next fall,
we may expect a reasonable fac-
simile for the posting of future
bizarre General scores.

In last night’s encounter, Nimble
Norris Eastman ascended from the
mucky waters of the Doremus pool
to delight the throng with his fancy
moves and his quick tongue. To
complement the floor work of
Eastman were the steady hip shots
of Dean Atwood, who also captain-
ed the losing effort. Providing
board strength were Lyles and
Hannum, but indeed there was a
very real dearth of Faculty re-
bounds last night.

 

The Intramural All Stars were

 

By TOM CARPENTER

The Washington and Lee basket- |
ball team finished its season Friday |
in typical style, losing to Centre,|
105-81, in the first round of the)
CAC Tournament. This amounts to|
a fifth place finish in a five-team)
league. It was a happy affair for|
most of the Generals in that one of |
the worst seasons in W&L history)
has now come to a close. I imagine
most of them feel that next year is
certain to be somewhat more enjoy-|
able than this year was.

Verne Canfield is also probably
relieved to see this season come to
an end. For Canfield this was a new
experience, being head man of a
losing, to say the least, basketball
team. Now that he is over the hump,
having survived his first season as|
coach here, a feat that deserves rec-
ognition, he can look forward to
bigger and better things in the years
to «ome, and it appears that he will
be here for some time unless he
himself decides to move on because
of a better offer or the like. Don’t
take this vote of confidence,
Coach, because I don’t want to give
you the kiss of death.

The Centre defeat Friday left the
Generals with a final reeord of 2
victories and 17 losing efforts. One
of the two victories, the one over
Old Domniion, was an upset, while
the victory over North

a5 a

leyan proved that there was

paced by Bob Lohman, who con-
tinually broke into the clear for
valuable lay-ups; George Madison,
who brought down the bulk of both
offensive and defensive rebounds;
and Skip Chase, who managed to
weather the abuse heaped upon
him by Coach Eastman during the
entire contest. Indeed Skip poured
salt in his own wounds by inadvert-
ently attempting to stuff the nets
of the enemy, but to his dismay
the shot went awry.

After the initial stanza of the
battle, the faculty found them-
selves in their best position of the
evening, tied at 4-4. The IM
cagers then went to work to take
a 15-9 at the half—a lead ex-
tended to 28-19 at the end of three
periods. The hustling veterans then
closed the gap with a last minute
surge, but it was too late...

Of course the struggle was proc-
tored by Coach Lord, in good voice
and high spirits, who livened up the
activities. In addition to his antics,
the crowd was treated to the com-
ments of Doctor Shillington, in trib-|
al garb for the annual event. In-|
deed all were in a gay mood.

 

Generals, and even Wesleyan had
won one game.

The 105 points by Centre typified
the Generals’ defensive play all sea-
son, although one of the players
commented that Centre’s passing was
vastly improved over what they
showed in the previous game with
the Generals this season. All year
the Blue and White were suscep-
tible to the fast break, as was dem-
onstrated by RPI here last Tuesday.
Canfield’s boys seem to lack overall
speed. Before the Generals can have
a winning team they are going to
have to learn how to play defense.

The offense, on the other hand, was
hot and cold, usually cold. The out-

| Side shooting was generally deficient
jand the inside shooting was only

as good as Dick Livnigston on any
given night. Fortunately for Can-
field Livingston is the only important
loss from this year’s club, assuming

| that Jeff Twardy will be eligible to

play next season. The team could
get a big lift if Lou Paterno goes
to law school here next year. Pater-
no, who has one more year of eligi-
bility remaining, has proven in pre-
vious seasons that he can provide
the much needed outside shooting

threat. With Twardy, who could de-
velop into another Roger Fauber,
and Lou Paterno next year the

|Generals could provide the home-
Carolina |
Wesleyan was to be expected. Wes-|

town fans some really interesting
basketball. Without them it seems
safe to say that Canfield will be in
for another long season.

W&L Freshman Wins Triple Jump In State Meet;

Switrerland — The International Travel Establishment will locate job
opportunities in Europe for anyone who likes the idea of a fun-filled,
low cost trip to Europe. Jobs are available in all fields throughout

gue. Sewanee still managed to give

Tech stiff battles in their meetings

Actually Tech gave Sewanee a
rather sound beating, but the Vols
escaped with a twelve point vic-
tory. This is quite interesting in
light of the fact that Tennessee,
before their upset loss te Alabama

the nation and was top dog in the

Musick, Winfield,
White Victorious In
Win by Monarchs

By BOB MAY
Tuesday Sports Writer

The Washington and Lee varsity
wrestlers were handed a 17-11 beat-
ing on Saturday by highly-regarded
Old Dominion College. The contest
played at Norfolk left the General
grapplers with three setbacks
compared to seven victories.

In the lid-lifter tri-captain Butch
West ended up on the short end of
a 9-3 tally. At 130, however, Dick
Musick evened the match for the
W&L grapplers with a 10-2 trounc-
ing of Robert Hall, bringing his
team-leading record to 9-1. Kimble
White, in the 137-pound class, man-
aged the only pin of the day for
the Generals. Down 5-0, White re-
versed his opponent to record his

as

sixth win of the season after 33
seconds of the third period.
Tri-captain Tom Stover at 147

lost a wild match to Irwin Williams
by a 10-7 count. Paul Cote kept
Q.D. rolling with an 8-1 victory over
Jamie Andrew. Tri-captain Peter
Winfield at 167 kept the Generals in
contention as he edged the Monarch
captain Richard Harris 4-3. How-
ever, in the 177 division Warren
Stewart was whitewashed in a close
one, 2-0.

In the heavyweight class the Gen-
erals were further frustrated as
John Bogart was pinned by the op-
ponents Jeff Hall at 6:33 of the en-
counter.

The W&L grapplers finish out
their season Saturday night wiht a
home match against a tough Virginia
team.

ing away an old leaf, offering tem-
porary salvation. He is a father to
making love in a church. The irony
is astringent. God’s role mingles
imperceptibly with the Father’s, This
is made explicit in one of the film’s
key scenes when Ester confronts
Anna in her bed with a foreign
lover. “I hate you because you make
everything so important!” Anna
cries, “I’m fed up with your princi-
ples. When father died you didn’t
want to go on living. Why are you
living still?” Ester continues the
moral judgment inherited from her
father. Anna has rejected it and fol-
lows only the desires of her strong,
healthy body.

But Father is dead, as Ester re-
calls on what she thinks is her
death-bed. She makes what she con-
siders her “confession before divine
unction.” Placing her hand on the
valet’s head, she is overcome by
her fear and hate of sex, of “male
glands” and “horrible forces,” she
wipes the sweat off her chest and
lips and cries out her anguish, the
division of nature.

Then, in one of the film’s most
humbling moments, Bergman shows
us fear on the threshhold of death.
A sound like departing ship’s sirens
looms loudly and Ester gasps in a
panic of suffocation. Terrified, she
finally draws the sheet over her
head, as if to get rid of it once
and for all, to make a true winding
sheet at last. It is a naive and tre-
mendous gesture, witnessed silently
by the old valet, who has just been
identified as the owner of the watch
whose ticking has been present at
the beginning of the film and at all
the turning points, and is the only
noise without a naturalistic basis.

It is difficult not to believe that
on this deeper, more imaginative
level, the old man is not meant to
stand in the place of God—a slightly
absurd, fragil and temporary next-
best.

The meaning of several other im-
ages are beautiful and emerge only
if we forget the hullabaloo raised

agreement. One’s personal honor is

|quite a different thing. This honor

is a product of environment and up-
bringing and may or may not con-
sider the same things honorable or
dishonorable that Washington and
Lee as an institution does.

A former executive committeeman
once told me that when a student
is found guilty of an honor violation,
the university as a whole is simply
admitting an error in the admission
process. This is to say that a stu-
dent who was not “honorable” was
admitted to the university by mis-
take. This is sheer sophistry. How
could the office of admissions look
into the heart of the individual and
know his personal value? We simply
make an agreement and do our best
to live up to it.

To illustrate this point more clear-

ly, I must admit that I do not know;

positively that I will never lie, cheat,
or steal. Would I be strong enough
to not lie, cheat, or steal under great
emotional strain? For all I know I
might not. I do not know that I
could report an honor violation on
the part of a very close friend.

new 2-year

Army ROTC program means 10 you

A new Reserve Officer Training Corps program permits selected
college sophomores to be commissioned as Army Second Lieuten-
ants in two years. You can do this by:

1. Completing a special 6-week summer camp between your soph-

omore and junior years.

2. Completing the 2-year Advanced Course at any school offering

the ROTC program.

What are the benefits of Army ROTC training?

Management training for success in civilian or military life.

$40 per month pay while attend

ing the Advanced Course, plus

uniforms; pay and paid travel for summer camps.

Eligibility for free flight instruction at selected schools lead-

ing to a private pilot’s license.

A commission as an Army officer, with all of its accompanying
benefits, including higher income, greater opportunity for ad-

vancement and officer status.

The personal satisfaction that comes from knowing you're
trained to assume leadership responsibilities.

These benefits will put you a step ahead of other college graduates
and will pay off for the rest of your life. You owe it to yourself to
investigate these new opportunities.

| This brings into view what Mr.
| Eric Sevareid, in a recent issue of
|The New Republic, was quoted as
‘ealling “the choice between an in-
| stitutional conscience and one’s na-
utral conscience.” It is easy to see
that under pressure a conflict might
arise here and a breakdown similar
to the two under consideration re-
sult from this frustration,

The New Republic goes on to point
out that “American ethos has held
in ill repute the man who tells on a
friend....That puts a very severe
strain on an honor system.”

If we accept this explanation, we
must ask what can be done to pre-
vent any such problem in the future.
There is no clear cut answer. We
must all continuously analyze and
re-evaluate our own system with
the view of reducing these conflicts
as much as possbile. In this respon-
sibility, however, we at Washington
and Lee fail tragically.

WELCOME BACK to the Halls of Avademe! They may or may
not be covered with ivy—but what’s on our mind is what's going
to be covering you! So let’s take the plunge, and get your ward-

robe with it!

FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE-specitically, with

one of the new “Three-Alarm Blazers”! This is
a new breed of blazer, and one to keep clearly
in mind when you're looking for a new sport
jacket. They’re just what they sound like—

colorful!—in reds from brilliant
in greens from billiard-table

bright blues and, of course, in camel! Linings
blaze brighter, too—solids, stripes and patterns
to contrast or blend with the blazer. Buttons
account for the third alarm, in brilliant ce-
ramic with colorful motifs, or in bright, bur-

nished metals.

TAKE A GIANT STEP into “Giant Plaids,” for another new look in

sport jackets. These oversize plaid patterns can be found in rich,
mellow color combinations like brown with blue, tan and brown

with dark red, and light and da

course, with the natural shoulder styling favored on campuses

from coast to coast.

“BIG y” GETS A BIG VOTE for still a third idea in sports jackets.

This is your favorite herringbone pattern, but it’s magnified to a
mighty power—especially in black and white or black and gray
combinations of hefty, husky yarns! The “Big V” adds a bold
note to the classic sport coat this year.

“CLUB CHINOS” —NEW CLASS FOR NEW CLASSES. The new

Chinos are neater, trimmer and slimmer than last year—and lots
of them will stay that way longer! Practical polyester-blend fab-
rics contribute extra crease-retention, in or out of the laundromat.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

Friday Edition

 

A Representative Government

In its most decisive meeting this school year, the Executive
Committee proposed a change in the structure of its member-

ship which is long overdue.

If the student government committee is to be truly repre-
sentative of the student body, if it is to have balanced represen-
tation, the proposed amendment to allow the law school only
two members instead of three is a forward step. It seems strange
that a group of 163 students should have three representatives,
whereas a class of 338 students (freshman class) should have

but one representative.

First year law students number 65 and elect one represen-
tative; the freshman class, having 338 members, elects the
same number of Committeemen. The second year law class
has 51 members, while the sophomore class has 388; yet each
class is represented by one EC member. The junior class has
250 members and the senior class, 248; having two represen-
tatives from each of the two classes, simple math shows us

that there is one EC member

However, the third year law class elects one Committeeman
for its 47 members. The unbalanced representation is obvious.

The needed restructure has been caused, not only by the
gross imbalance of representation, but also by the nature of
the law school’s relationship to the rest of the University. The
dissociation of Tucker Hall from the rest of the campus has |
become more and more obvious lately. The fact is that the
law school has a proportionately large representation on the
Executive Committee, even though as a group it has less con-
nection with the life of the University and participates less in
the extra-curricular activities at W&L. Such a situation should

not be allowed to continue.

The situation has worsened in the past few years as the

law school has received more

colleges. The new law students have fewer interests in com-
mon with the undergraduates. Few law students attend under-
graduate activities; almost none concern themselves with under-
graduate problems. Law students are virtually never assimilat-

ed: honor trials are unheard of

Why then should one-third of the Executive Committee
be composed of law students, who represent a group of only
163 students—a group which is for the most part disinterested
in the undergraduate school and mainstream of university life?

We applaud the action of the Executive Committee in pro-
posing the law school amendment to the constitution. Surely
the unbalanced representation of the students’ governing body
is a situation which should be remedied.

Honor System Debate

 

EC Members

JERRY

Senior Law E.C,

‘URNER

Representative

As most W&L students must know by now, it has been

suggested that the permanent e

xpulsion penalty for an honor

system offense should be abolished in favor of a lesser penalty

involving temporary expulsion

, presumably lasting for one

year. In protesting against such a change, I am writing this
article because I sincerely respect and believe in the Honor

System as it now works,

The primary argument for change seems to be based on the
“moral justification’? of the permanent expulsion rule. Yet

the Honor System penalty does not
involve a question of “moral justi-
fication”; it is a matter of student
policy. The students of Washington
and Lee as a matter of policy, not
morality, have set for themselves a
standard of conduct, which forbids
the members of the student body to
lie, cheat, or steal under circum-
stances which concern the student
as a member of this student body.
In other words, this academic society
has set up a code by which each
student must live; if any student de-
liberately chooses not to follow this
code, he is required to leave this
society.
Violators Not Totally Dishonorable
By expelling a student from its so-
ciety, the student body does not
claim or think that the violator is

unfit for any other society, includ-
ing the world at large. Expulsion
under the Honor Syster simply
means that because a violator has
chosen not to live by the rules of}
this society, he is manifestly unfit to
be a member of this society.

But why must this expulsion be
permanent? IT answer that ques-
tion by asking: What can it prove
to allow the violator to return to
W&L? What good can it do? Rick
Carrell has said that it will “allow
the offender to retain his human
worth instead of being branded as
totally dishonorable object.” The
fact is that no one brands the vio-
lator as “totally dishonorable”; no
one denies his human worth. A
society, or student body, has simp-
ly required the student to leave

because the student of his own
choice will not, has not, lived up
to our society's standard.

Carrell has said that many stu-
dents leave the university under the
Honor System because of temporary,

The purpose of the Washington and Lee Honor System ts

primarily to guarantee a spirit

of academic honesty and sec-

ondarily to reinforce every student’s natural penchant for hon-
orable behavior. In order to maintain the integrity of the sys-

tem stiff and impartial penalties

must be assigned to every vio-

lator. The application of these penalties is occasional and
must be recognized as failures of the system: that is, the pur-
pose of the system is to maintain honor not to punish examples

of dishonor, but only the hope

Turner Justifies Honor Penalty

(Continued from page 2)

but very strong, pressures, and in
his opinion such a student is worthy
of W&L after a length of time. But
what effeet will temporary expul-
sion have? Does temporary expul-
sion mean that a violator can, and
in faet will, build up a resistance
to pressure while he is absent
from the University? I see nothing
in expulsion, temporary or other-
wise, which would in itself create
any interresistnce. Temporary ex-
pulsion provides no assurance what-
soever that this one-time offender
will not again violate our trust. As
a matter of fact, Columbia’s research
of Academic Dishonesty and Its Con-
trol in College has found by survey
that out of the total number of
those people who cheat, “there are
at least as many repeaters as one-
time offenders.”
One-Year Expulsion

Moreover, if I correctly under-
stand the proposed change, the one
vear expulsion rule would apply to
all first-time offenders (because of
the inequity of any possible distine-
tion). But these first offenders vio-
lated the trust of every W&L stu-
dent, Can we reasonably allow this
person to return here where trust
is paramount? That student made
his decision to live outside of our
trust, or beliefs, and our code.

It is apparent that a one-year ex-
pulsion rule has but one aim—to
punish the violator. This idea of
punishment, however, does not be-
long in our Honor System. We do
not seek to punish, but rather to
maintain our standards by exclud-
ing those who have not lived ac-
cording to our code. If the purpose
of the Honor System were to pun-
ish violaters, a fine or perhaps lower
grades would suffice. But punish-
ments could never assure us that
the violator will not fall below the
standard again, whereas permanent
expulsion does, because it removes

the student to another society whose
standards may not be so high as
ours.

As to Mr. Hartin’s statement that
honor is not absolute, I offer my
opinion that the absoluteness of this
Honor System lies in the fact that
conduct is either above or below
that standard which I mentioned in
my second paragraph. Within W&L’s
society conduct below the required
standard is absolutely dishonorable.
Again no one is saying that a vio-
lation of our code implies or man-
fests that the violator is dishonor-
able outside of our society.

Finally, even if we assume that
a few instances of injustice occur
under our Honor System (although
I know of no such instances), are
we justified in tampering with this
Honor System which has maintained
a lengthy record of outstanding suc-
cess: the many benefits of a suc-
cessful Honor System have remained
with W&L through many years and
many problems.

Don’t misunderstand me. I am not
fighting change as such, But change

gard to the risk involved. One ques-
tion remains: can we, in view of the
dubious benefits of this proposed
change risk the outstanding success
and innumerable benefits of our
Honor System.

System ‘Harsh’

(Continued from page 2)

The Columbia Universiiy Survey
on cheating suggests that in lessen-
ing the severity of punishment for
cheating the incidence
rises. In view of the usual definition
of “lenieney” in this context—ad-
monishment by the appropriate dean,
flunking the course involved, being
placed on academic probation, ete.—
a one year suspension with the ac-
companying stigma can hardly be
considered lenient.

Several of the JV Generals are re-

other who will help W&L in the

No, he hasn't. Therefore one might
question his ability to make a judg-

much more than a place to study;
it is a place where one makes life-

and yes, even drinks.

I am glad that Mr. Beardslee has
had “experience” with fraternities
at Lehigh, I would like him to clarify
exactly what first-hand experience
he has had with fraternities at W&L.
Evidently, he judges our fraternities
by the students who relieve them-
selves in the Hollins parking lot
and vomit in his chapel. Should this
very small minority be used to judge
our fraternities? I don’t really think
so. Another source of his misinfor-
mation sems to be from second-hand
evidence. If

reports or hear-say
Mr. Beardslee had taken the time
to visit some of our fraternities,

perhaps he wouldn't have been so
critical, After all, Hollins isn’t more
than fifty miles away, and the time
spent in visiting W&L would have
been well worth the price of not be-
ing so obviously misinformed.

Even after this prejudiced attack,
I’m sure that any fraternity on cam-
pus (even Phi Kappa Psi) would be
glad to have Mr. Beardslee as a
guest. Then he could form his opin-

‘ions with first-hand knowledge.

Gilliam Sees W&XL Unity Loss

(Continued from page 2)

some forty of fifty students. Thus
when the veterans returned to W&L
they made up the largest percentage
of the student body. His fear was
that these men, many of them 24 or
25 years old, might consider an honor
system somewhat corny or immature
and therefore vote it out. He was
thrilled, however, when these men
proved to be the system’s strongest
supporters.

Leaving the Honor System and
turning to the speaking tradition
and conventional dress, Dean Gil-
liam commented that, in contrast
to the Honor System, they are not
indispensible. They are, however, an
extremely valuable part of Washing-
ton and Lee.

Thes traditions grew up follow-
ing World War I. At the time there
was no need for enforcing them,
You spoke to everyone because
you knew them, and you wore a
coat and tie at all times because
leisure wear was not popular
among students. To look through
a Calyx of no more than ten years
ago, he said, you will notice that
the only time students are not
wearing a coat and tie is when

 

they are in athletic gear, It is cer-
tainly not the same today. |

Dean Gilliam attributes the gener- |
al decline in the observance of
these traditions to a number of fac-
tors. Most obvious of these reasons
is that our student body is now
larger and more individualistic than
at any time in the past. The unity
that once existed among the students
here is no longer present. Dean Gil-,
liam remarked that, in the “old
days” no one left Lexington except

and that fraternity meetings were
held at eleven o’clock on Saturday
nights.

Though times have changed, he
nevertheless feels that there is a
great deal of value still to be gained
from maintaining our speaking and
dress traditions. He believes them to
be a very valuable element of Wash-
ington and Lee, Many times over the
past thirty-nine years that he has
been with Washington and Lee, he
has been told that we have the
friendliest and best-dressed body of
students anywhere. Holding on to
this image certainly seems worth-
while, yet the present student body
has allowed it to slide. This is not
totally to their discredit, however,
for the thoughtful appraisal which
our traditions have been given is the
healthy sign of a reflective and con-
cerned student body. Still Dean Gil-
liam finds it hard to remain im-
partial when W&L’s traditions are
brought into question, “I only wish
I knew,” he said, “of some magic
formula which could be used to re-
store them.”

Kiwanis Club
Plans Operetta
For March 18-20

By FRANK L. FAIRCHILD, JR.
Rehearsals are now in progress for
the local Kiwanis Club’s production
of Sullivan operetta lolanthe. The
play, a musical with light hearted
lyrics and memorable melodies, is
sponsored by the local civic club
as a fund raising project for the Ki-
wanis Scholarship Fund. It is sched-
uled to be produced March 18-20 at
the Waddell School.

According to Mr. David Dick-
ens of the German Department,
one of the two co-ordinators for
the community production, Iolan-
the “is essentially a satire on
British politics.” It also pokes fun
at the Peter-Pan plays popular
in 19th century England,

In a brief compendium of the in-
volved plot, Mr. Dickens explained
that the title character, Iolanthe,

she is banished to the bottom of ¢
stream by the fairy queen as
Martha P. Laverty, a member of the
Music Department at Southern
Seminary).

W&L Students Participate

loalnthe’s son, Strephon (Dan
Manson, a W&L senior) possesses
the dual nature of a spirit and a
mortal. He falls in love with a shep-
herdess named Phyllis (Mrs. John
C. Allen, a resident of Lexington)
who is a ward of the Lord Chancel-
lor (VMI instructor Francis H. M.
Mackenzie).

The Lord Chancellor and peers of
parliament led by Mount Mountar-
arat (W&L senior Bill Supon) and
Lord Tolloller (Col. F. H. Barksdale
of VMI) are all in love with Phyllis
also. It is from this conflict that the
plot developes.

Stewart Conducts Orchestra

Apart from the principle roles,
there is active W&L participation in
numerous phases of the production.
The male chorus includes students
Tom Davis, Fred Taussig, and Peter
Strohm and, in addition, faculty
members Messrs. Hines, Freeman,
DeVogt and Dickens. The Orchestra
is being conducted by Mr. Robert
Stewart, director of the W&L Glee
Club. Dean John is a member of the
publicity committee while Dr.
Charles Phillips heads ticket distri-
bution.

Mr. Dickens emphasizes that the
local Kiwanis Club is hoping for
strong student support to justify
the liberal expenditures for cos-
tumes. Tickets, selling for one dollar,
may be obtained at Legget’s Depart-

ment Store, MceCrum’s Drug Store,
the Campus Corner, or from any
menrber of the cast

KA National Locates In Lexington

E.C. Studies Referendum;
Consider Political System

a group of students who enthusias-
tically support this tradition, fifty
to sixty per cent of those who par-
ticipated in the poll expressed some
degree of dissatisfaction.

Second Poll Overruled

In view of the poor response to
the first poll, the BC decided against
conducting a second one. It was
generally felt that a second poll
would provide little additional in-
formation. Mendel further empha-
sized that the EC must continue “to
study and analyze the issue of con-
ventional dress.”

Several members of the EC sug-
gested that the first poll should be
entirely discounted on the grounds
that its findings were inconclusive.
Once again there was strong sup-
port for stricter inforcement on
campus and especially in the l-
brary and dining hall The Commit-
tee opposed a move to ask the facul-
ty to require conventional dress in
class because the tradition is a stu-
dent rather than administrative
policy.

Assimilation Plans Coming

A motion was passed following the
discussion period which requested
Brooks Brown, chairman of the As-
similation Committee, to develop a
specic plan for the enforcement and
application of conventional dress.
The plan will be submitted to the
EC next Monday.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
On the Honor System:

Last week a proposal was made by a mem-
ber of the Executive Committee that the hon-
or system be modified by the introduction of
a lighter penalty, a one-year suspension. The
proponents of this change center their attack
against the status quo on the harshness of the
present penalty of permanent expulsion, and
on a supposed lack of moral justification for
this single penalty. Concern for students forced
to withdraw from the university because of
a breach of the honor system is understand-
able, for these men face a heavy penalty, one
which in many cases must be disproportionate
to the offence they have committed. Yet when
this concern for a few students who must sep-
arate themselves from the university each year
causes the form of the honor system to be
questioned, we can only say that it is a mis-
guided concern. It is misguided in that it
regards only the penalty faced by a few men
and is blind to the benefits to the many of the
honor system.

The heavy penalty paid each year by sev-
eral students must be weighed against the
principle of the “greatest good for the great-
est number.” There are a few men who are
too weak to abide by the obligation they un-
dertook, upon entering Washington and Lee,
to live under the honor system; these men
must suffer for their weakness. But in the op-
posite scale rest the happiness of the entire
university community and the advantages
which accrue to all from the atmosphere which
can be created only by a truly effective honor
system. In return for the price of separating
the several offenders from the rest of the
community, the remainder of Washington and
Lee men can consider themselves relatively
free of lying, cheating and stealing. This cher-
ished privilege is indeed a “moral justification”
for the mandatory withdrawal of those very
few who have violated the code.

To say that the college community can
consider itself free from lying, cheating and
stealing, is not to say that we can pretend
that each student is absolutely honorable. It is
to say that we can assume—and the assump-
tion is borne out by individual experience—
that the student body is generally free of
these sins insofar as they have been under-
stood to be placed under the system. While

this is a limited concept, in its own area it is
absolute, one which is maintained by the stu-
dent body with a very slight margin of excep-
tion. This means that Washington and Lee en-
joys an atmosphere of academic freedom and
trust which could not be achieved in any
other way. It means that a student is free to
leave his possessions anywhere on campus
without fear that they will be stolen. It means
that a student can be sure that his work
being done in the same individual effort which
every other student goes through, and that he
is being graded fairly for the amount of work
he does.
The Benefits at No Price?

The supporters of the changed penalty
will be quick to claim that they do not wish
to lose all these advantages. They want to
keep the benefits, but without the present pen-
alty of automatic expulsion. However, the fact
is that the change being sought would forfeit
the honor system as we know it—the most ef-
fective system imaginable. The advocates of a
lighter penalty want to “have their cake and
eat it too’’; this is what it comes down to to try
to preserve the honor system’s advantages
while discarding the disadvantage of harshness
to violators. The two ideas are mutually ex-
clusive. That the withdrawal of those men who
violate the system is necessary to its effective
functioning is evident both by experience
and by reason. The experience of schools
which have tried more lenient punishments s
has been that cheating increases with the eas-
ing of the punishment. A recent survey con-
ducted by a Washington and Lee graduate
now at Columbia University clearly illustrates
this lesson.

Moreover, common sense is sufficient to
confirm the expectation that offenses would
be encouraged, and therefore probably in-
creased, once the penalty for violation were
lightened and offenders allowed to return to
school. In the first place, offenses would be
encouraged by the fact that the present honor
system’s idealism would be removed; ice., with
the idea of an ideally honorable (if limited by
scope) community denied the honor system
would have become a disciplinary system rath-
er than a code of conduct. Thus it would be
more subject to violation. In the second plac e,

presented by the fraternity crities is

a student would be more likely to risk a year’s
suspension than permanent separation from
the school. A one-year suspension, it is true,
is no lenient penalty; yet it would be so much
lighter than the present penalty that it could
not help but have a staggering moral effect
on students’ concept of the honor system.
The greatest effect of this development would
not be that a few more students would com-
mit violations each year, but that such in-
creased abuse of the system would lead to
disrespect among the rest of the students.
Eventually increasing violations would poison
the honor system for the whole student body.
Since the honor system is dependent on an
almost unanimous consent of those who live
under it, an onslaught of disrespect, or sus-
picion of the system’s effectiveness, would
ruin it. This would be the final effect of a
softening of the penalty.

What would be the effect of inviting hon-
or system violators to return to the university
after a year’s separation? These are men whom
we generally do not consider basically dishon-
orable by any means; yet they are men who
have proved that they are unwilling or unable
to fulfill the specific obligation they agreed to
when they entered Washington and Lee: not
to break the university’s code of honorable
conduct. By reaccepting these men the school
would be taking a serious chance of sacrificing
the unanimous support required by the honor
system. Such a step, just like the factor of in-
creasing violations, would poison the system
for others, who would be forced to suspect
the unanimity of support which the honor
system must have to function successfully.

So a relaxation of the rigid penalty would
invite a breakdown in rigid adherence to the
honor system, not by actually making honor
violations more attractive—for such thinking
would inflence only a small percentage of
students—but through the harmful effect
which the actions of this small percentage
would have on the majority. While the pro-
posed easing of the penalty would introduce
the element of forgiveness into the system,
it would also turn the system into a disciplinary
rather than an honor code. This transition is
indeed what some proponents of the modified
penalty foresee i in the end. But we believe that

Modification of Penalty Would Destroy System

the vast majority of the student body is still
“idealistic” enough to support a way of life
which demands at least a defined quality of
honor from every member of its society.

This same idealism has existed in many
generations of Washington and Lee men, and
the fact that these men have passed the hon-
or system down to the present student body
indicates the constant esteem in which it has
been held. The honor system does not belong
to the present, but to all those who have gone
before and even more, to all those who will
come in the future. It is something which has
been given in order that it may be passed on
intact. It is a heritage of which Washington
and Lee men ought to be jealous, for it is
almost unique among honor systems. Its gen-
uine effectiveness, its quality of stren gthening
a spirit of honor in an individual, and the fact
that it is entirely a student product and re-
sponsibility—these things set our honor sys-
tem apart and make it the magnificent asset it
is to Washington and Lee students.

The Distinctive Single Feature

It is difficult to imagine Washington and
Lee without the honor system working as ef-
fectively as we now have it. The honor system
at the same time embodies all aspects of the
spirit of Washington and Lee, and it is itself
the most distinctive single feature of the uni-
versity. It is what Washington and Lee is
known for and respected for all over the na-
tion. It is also the thing that has left the deep-
est impression on the minds and spirits of men
who have attended Washington and Lee—and
this testimony alone ought to be evidence of
the value of the honor system.

The vitality of the honor system through-
out Washington and Lee’s history, the large
part it has in the makeup of the school’s"'char-
acter” — these considerations must be added to
practical ones of the system’s effectiveness
whenever changing it is discussed. Alteration
of the honor system must be approached es-
pecially carefully because it is a_ tradition
which once interrupted could not be fully re-
stored. It is the responsibility of each member
of the student body to evaluuate the honor
system for himself and to judge whether the
change now proposed would not one day de-
stroy a spirit which is beyond replacement.

By DAVID DOUGHTERY

Washington and Lee’s Warren Stewart stunned a wild

handling Virginia’s Alex Wells and allowing the Generals to tie
the Cavaliers, 12-12. Wells, the Wahoo captain with a spark-

ling record, was virtually conceded*

The Generals suffered a
blow in the opening encounter at
123 as tri-captain Butch West was
upset by Don Ruths, 7-3. West made
the match tight with a reversal in
the third period which brought the
score to 5-3, but the quick Ruths
reversed West to put the contest out
of reach.

WEL came back to knot the
score when Dick Musick won a de-
cision at 130 over Bob Rhodes, 4-1.

to the NCAA. I believe that the
Southern Conference and all other
leagues that have these post season
play-offs should re-examine the ad-
vantage s and disadvantages of them.

I think they will find that they do
'more harm than good. The abolish-
ment of the tournaments will mean
better representation by those errant
leagues and thus a better image in

Discusses CONT

(Continued from page 2) |
dicting exactly how many people |
will participate in CONTACT, but}
we strongly encourage all students |
to bring their dates and guests to |
any, or all, of the activities. The|
more people that can share CON-
TACT the better. CONTACT has
been widely publicized through the
University Information Services and
the groundwork is being laid for
maximum newspaper, radio and tele-
vision coverage.

CONTACT has been planned to in-
sure as much informality as possible.
In this way, students will be able to
discuss topics of particular interest
in greater depth, and the guest
speakers will always be available
to autograph their books or discuss
their contents. It is the hope of the
Steering Committee that CONTACT
will provide a relaxed and stimulat-
ing weekend atmosphere that will
offer a contrast to the normal party
weekends. We sincerely feel that any
student who takes part seriously in
the symposium will find it rewarding
and interesting. It is a rare oppor-|
tunity to meet and talk with men
of exceptional background and ac-)|
complishment.

The Steering Committee does not)
suggest that CONTACT will neces-|
sarily be a reflection of any “intel-
lectual atmosphere” at Washington |
and Lee. We feel it safe to assume |
that any relatively educated person |
in our age group is eager to learn

and has a curiosity of the things
about him. If CONTACT is success-
ful, then it is only what we had ex-
1. If CONTACT is not well at-
tended—if it fails—then we must re-
member that this will probably kill
the possibilities for another student
program of this type, and the cynics
will feel more justified in taking
more polemie shots at Hairy South-
ern Collegian, CONTACT is not out
to prove or dis-prove anything. It
is a completely student controlled
symposium for the benefit of the
students and faculty in our collegiate
community. CONTACT is clearly an
unusual opportunity, and one should
take advantage of it.

The Language Requirement

In order to obtain a B.A. degree from Washington and
Lee, it is necessary to complete a third year course in one of the
modern languages. It is judged that on the completion of such
a course the student will have either the ability to speak or
read that language fluently He has a choice of which he wishes
to emphasize.

We do not deny that either of these achievements is a
valuable contribution to a liberal education. We would even
go so far as to say that they are essential for a complete edu-
cation. At the same time, however, we recognize that there are
other valuable components to a liberal education. Philosophy,
religion and economics are three of these, none of which
is included on the list of required courses. Of those that are
required, none take as many class hours to complete as does
the language requirement. Only six hours are required in sci-
ence and math and only twelve hours in history and Eng-
lish. The language requirement, on the other hand takes eigh-
teen hours for completion. Our first complaint is then, that
though the object of such a requirement is noble, the time
required for its completion is excessive.

Our second objection to the three year language require-
ment is that very few students who complete the 201-202
level have the ability to speak or read the language fluently.
In the first place the department finds it hard to demand such
competence from students who are forced to take the course,
and secondly, the majority of the students are reluctant to
do even the work that is required. Among the students who are
coerced into taking them, these courses are known as “hook
courses. That is, a course in which one only seeks to be average
and to get a C.

As a general rule, we spend our money where we will get
the most for it. The same should apply for our time. In order
to take three years of language at Washington and Lee, it costs
the student $340, figured on the basis of two dollars per class
hour. Most would prefer to spend this money on courses which
do require classroom instruction, and considering the nega-
tive attitude which hangs over Robinson Hall classrooms, they

would no doubt get more from it if spent elsewhere. The time.

spent on these courses is again poorly invested for many of
these students. For those who lack the motivation or aptitude
to master a foreign language, translations become busywork
of no greater value than a crossword puzzle. Why not allow
such students to spend their time and their money on a sub-
ject in which they are interested and take the load of such
deadweight off the professors in the language department?

We do not intend in this editorial to slight the dedicated
professors in modern languages. We wish only to point out
that the emphasis laid on this program is totally disproportion-
ate with rest of our program here. How can we rationalize
having three Spanish, five French, and four German profes-
sors, when we have only two in philosophy, and how can we re-
quire a student to take eighteen semester hours of a foreign
language when we only require twelve hours in English?

Traditional Eyesore

An old eyesore which has proved about as useful as Old
George atop Washington Hall and of far less symbolic value
has been too long in useless evidence on this campus.

Students have gotten too used to seeing the unwanted
structure.

Editorial after editorial has been written about it.

The administration has successfully managed to sidestep its
removal or conversion into a useful building.

If it’s not to be used, let’s remove it so that the walk from
the freshman quad to the library will be a few steps shorter.

If the administration wants to soothe its conscience con-
cerning the glaring lack of a real W&L Student Union, it might
be converted into a quasi-Student Union.

At any rate, something should be done. If it can’t be con-
verted, it should be removed. If it can’t be removed, it should
be converted. Perhaps if it’s lefe just as it is, we can add it
someday to the list of W&L traditions.

The Ring-tum Phi would like to ask the administration
just what its plans for the building are. Thus far no one really
seems to know. The Old Co-op has been too long with us. So
has the need for a Student Union that is a Student Union.

 

 

A Bureaucracy?

In proposing the election of freshman class officers, the
Executive Committee has, admittedly, lived up to one of the

candidates to the ‘big three.”

The question is, however, what need is there for these ad.
ditional officers—except, of course, to fill the pages of the
Calyx? What functions would they perform? How valid would
be their election since freshmen seldom really know their class-
mates before fall freshman elections? Of what use would be
their election?

Mad As Hell

Dr. Fred C. Cole, President
Washington and Lee University
Virginia

Dear Dr. Cole:

Over Fancy Dress weekend I re-
turned to the school for the first
time since graduating in 1961.

Arriving in town too late to
change, my date, Miss Robbie Rad-
cliff, and I went directly to the dance
at about 11:30 in suit and sportcoat
we had traveled in. Seeing no ticket
desk we walked in to see the pro-
ceedings and to find Robbie’s broth-
er, Bob, an undergraduate. A stu-
dent officer of the dance immediately
asked us to leave for having no
ticket and being informally dressed.

Considering that the band was
finished and many couples had left
or were leaving I should have ex-
pected him to allow us to stay and
offer to help us find Bob after we
had explained the situation, but no
such luck and I’m mad as hell about
it. I hardly need add that Miss Rad-
cliff whose father graduated from
W&L and whose brother is now a
student there had a poor first im-
pression of the school after hearing
its praises all her life.

Initially 1 was inclined not to

ters To The Editor . . .

 

blame the school for one student's
conduct but, having observed the
general neglect of the speaking |
tradition and of conventional dress |
the rest of the weekend, I am f
moved to write.

The hospitality of the student body |
to visitors on campus has been well}
known in the past and, aside from |
being worthwhile in itself, has re-|
sulted in generous gifts from total |
strangers. I believe Doremus Gym)
was one such gift. Thus if you!
didn't care to maintain the tradi-
tional values of the W&L gentleman}
for better reasons, it would be prac-|
tical to do so

Surely everyone who knows
WAL will agree that its traditions |
have contributed immeasurably to
the schools fine reputation and
have set it apart from other schools
of similar size and endowment, In |
addition I'm certain the atmos- |
phere created by the school’s tra-

ically slow too. But you do have
the great spirit of General Lee, as
The University has the (embalmed)
spirit of Mr. Jefferson, to combat
Governor Berkley, Baron of Bote-
tourt. Berkerley prayed that educa-
tion and its cohort sedition, not come
to his Colony. I galute all efforts to
frustrate his prayer.

Fraternities and student leaders
ask for and receive enormous res-
ponsibility, My impression is that
more is granted in this state than
elsewhere. This does not mean that
Virginia school rules are less strict,
but that the cavalier tradition is
a cavalier flaunting of the rules.

Two items. My first introduction
to Washington and Lee was in a file
I inherited. It had an article on a
faculty meeting in Lexington which

(Don't try to defend yourselves,
boys, if you don’t want us to get
drunk, why do insist on serving us
that rotgut?)

Now we come to the resaon why

she drank it. Obviously because
either she didn’t know better, be-
cause she was thirsty and wasn’t of-
fered anything else to drink, or be-
cause she was so disgusted at what
was going on around her that she
had to drink it to ease the pain of
the company.

I have never understood why
you think this is fun for a date—

(if I may share my private |

Allows Cavalier Action

nearly reprimanded the Dean for a
remarkably generous allowance of
student public misbehaviour. The
Proctor was apparently appointed as
a result. Second, the history of ‘the
University by your sometime pro-
fessor, Marshall Fishwick, shows the
long tradition of social laissez faire.

The King who could do no wrong
is replaced by a boy courtier who
cannot be reprimanded or removed.
One such, carried yelling back onto
his school bus, uttered the aristo-
cratic cry at our night watchman,
“You can’t touch me.”

In the increasingly popular private
ethic, represented in The Southern
Conservative, fraternity brothers
show little responsibility for a broth-
er’s action, and lie to protect his
freedom.

One major reason why I have
pursued only a few of the viola-
tions I have seen here, is my im-
pression that the boy reported to
the righteous authorities is separ-
ated from the offended community,
but the fraternity or other system
which led him into trouble, is not
touched, Similarly, womanhood, as
reported in your February 19 edi-
torial, is protected, while the wo-
man herself may end in the gutter,

The privatist ethic, so appealing to
the cavalier, does not include anal-
ysis of the ground of disorder or the
influence of a dying system. It takes
a delight in being wrong, perverse
pride in bad reputation.

Let the University honour new
ways of forwarding ancient goals, Let
it find its corporations of academic
desuetude and social indulgence
without discernable purpose or con-
tribution, and close them, to the
health of their former inhabitants
and to the renewed honour of a
greatly -founded school.

 

 

I have yet to meet a girl who can
truly say that she had a good time
at one of your orgies. We get ac-
customed to them but never en-
joy them. Perhaps if boys didn’t
start hitting the bottle at 2 p.m.,
if they didn’t take such delight
in “grain parties” and the like,
and if they themselves weren't so
preoccupied with getting stoned,
they might find that their dates
would stay sober too.

I regret that you are so upset
that we are not punished for our
“misbehavior.” Frankly, I have never
noticed that you all were particu-
larly overburdened with punish-
ments. The fact is that girls, drunk
though they may be, are far more
discrete in their behavior.

You needn't fear that we women

there wasn’t any need for officers
and wondered what they would do.
Richard Nash, freshman E.C. repre-
sentative, who introduced the mea-
sure, argued strongly for its adop-
tion. Nash said that freshman officers
would greatly aid in more quickly
and smoothly assimilating the fresh-
man class into the University’s tra-
ditions and student body. He added
that,as a result the Freshman Class
would be more unified and could
take a more active part in helping
to set up such University functions
as dance sets and assemblies. This
proposal was one of the planks in
Student Body President Jim Kulp's
platform last spring, but was re-
jected by the E.C. earlier this year.

The so called Law School amend-
ment met with almost unanimous
approval. The consensus indicates
that the undergraduate body wants
a break with the Law School. Many
upperclassmen also feel that the law
students don’t particularly care to

Trackmen Beat Roanoke;

Meadors Stars for Generals

By TOM WHITE

Winning nine of 14 events, Wash-
ington and Lee’s winter track team
won its first dual meet of the season
in two starts last night as the Gen-
eral trackmen downed Roanoke by
a 42-point margin, 80-38.

In another meet last night, W&L
freshmen finished third in a triangu-
lar meet with Bridgewater and Fork
Union, Bridgewater came in first
with 59 points to 49 for Fork Union
and 18 for W&L.

Highlighting the W&L team effort
was the performance of freshman
Luke Meadors who picked up two
firsts winning the broad jump and
the triple jump. Meadors’ winning
effort in the broad jump was 19 feet
842 inches. In the triple jump his
total was 39 feet one inch.

The Generals also took two of
three other field events in last night's
meet. Winning the shot put was Tom
Sparks with a distance of 38 feet
three inches. W&L swept the top
three places in the event with Ben-
edict coming in second and Bob
Skinner third.

Rick Rogers added a victory for
W&L in the pole vault, another
event the Generals swept. Rogers
had a jump of ten feet six inches.
Johnny Graham was second, Clai-
borne Darden third.

The one General loss in field
events was in the high jump where
Clarke of Roanoke took first with a
jump of five feet four and three-
quarters inches. Caldwell of Roanoke
took second while Graham topped
General finishers in third.

Two team events were split. W&L
won the 440 relay with a time of
:47.2. Roanoke took the win in the
mile relay with a winning time of
3:37.7.

dergraduate students. As one junior
pointed out, “the law students don’t
like to have so many ties with un-
dergraduate school. They feel that
they are in graduate school now and
that a sharper distinction should ex-
ist between the two schools.” As
yet another student put it, “the
amendment is a step in the right di-
rection, still it’s a compromise which
falls far short of what should be
done, namely, that law students
shouldn’t be permitted to run for any
of the big three positions.” Finally
a seinor expressed the commonly
held view that law students strive
to be different anyway, so why try
to unite ourselves with them.

So the winds of change are blow-
ing strongly over the campus. As
the student body thinks in different

Smith Defends
Campus Political
Reorganization

By MIKE HASH
Managing Editor

 

Campus political parties and the |

clique system in particular were dis-
cussed last evening by the EC in
consultation with Steve Smith, the
author of revitalized political sys-

tem. Smith who presented his plan in |
a recent editorial answered questions |

and defended his proposal.

The general consensus of the EC
was favorable to the new plan. There
was some question of whether the
operation of open primaries within
each party would, in reality, be free
from clique domination. Although
several members of the EC felt that
clique control was inevitable, the
majority of the committee believed
that the new system would “once
remove the clique from campus elec-
tions.”

End of Clique Rule

In response to inquiries concern-
ing the feasibility of implementing
this proposal, Rick Carrell suggested
that open primaries be instituted in
the existing University Party. Carrell
felt that this would encourage the
nine houses not associated with any

pose of a primary. The open primary
would be required of all parties in
an effort to eliminate “rule by the
clique.”

Carrell further stated that if the
open primary system were adopted
the major opposition to party polities
would be removed. The so-called
independent houses have been, in
effect, protesting by non-participa-
tion in campus parties primarily be-
cause of the “machinations” of the
cliques

Sub-Committee Appointed

Final action on the proposal will
await the report of a sub-committee
headed by Rick Carrell and mem-
bers Fred Mindel, Bryant Kendrick,
and Dave Geer. This sub-committee
will present a specific proposal te
the EC at an early date. If passed
the proposals will necessarily require
a constitutional amendment and rat-
ification by the student body.

Springs Concert

For Saturday Eve
To Be Outdoors

By JIM CROTHERS

President of Springs Dances, Dave
Marchese, announced today that in
order to provide some variations to
weekend's format, Saturday
night’s concert in this dance set will
be held outdoors.

Arrangements are being made to
use the practice football field located
adjacent to Wilson Field. The vice-
president in charge of the concert,
Chuck Griffin, plans to provide
chairs for the faculty and explained
that students are urged to bring
blankets to sit on since seating fa-
cilities will not be provided.

There will be plenty of seating
space, but students are urged to be
on time to the 8 p.m. concert since
the space will be allotted on the first-
come basis.

Tickets and admissions for the
concert will be handled in the same
manner as they would for a regular
inside performance. The only en-
trance to the show will be at the

Although the entertainment for
Springs has not yet been announced,
Marchese noted that he was sure
everyone would enjoy the new ar-
rangement, and that every effort was
being made to insure good sound
reproduction.

In case of rain or wet grounds, the
Saturday concert will revert back
inside to Doremus Gymnasium, and
will be held at the customary 8 p.m,

NOTICE

There will be a Conservative
Society meeting on Wednesday
evening at 7:30 p.m, in the East
Room of the Law School. All

By WENDALL WINN

Friday night, February 26, a sym-
posium in the form of a panel dis-
cussion by four distinguished guest
speakers was held at VMI in which
the merits and failings of the pro-
posed Medicare bill were discussed.
The four panelists who were selected
individually, having no foreknowl-

edge of what one another had to
say, were introduced by the moder-
ator, Dr. Crawford, a practitioner in

nearby Woodstock.

The topics of the discussion ranged
from “Eldercare” to socialized medi-
cine and dealt with numerous as-
pects of the Medicare question from
several viewpoints. The first speaker,
Dr. Guy Hollifield, is an Assistant
Professor of Internal Medicine at the
University of Virginia, who was
concerned, “not with the philosophy
behind the proposed program of
Medical Ouare but application
among the people.”

“Zeal” Restrained

While supporting Medicare
those who would benefit from it,
Hollifield emphasized the
of restraining our “zeal”

The new Student Health Commit-

fall to make a comprehensive sur-
vey of the present health services

changes and improvements, has re-

Dr. Wingfield, a Lynchburg psy-
chiatrist, is now visiting the campus

basis of the Self-Study Committee's
consideration of the student health
area.

Initiation in April

The newly elected members will
be initiated in early April follow-
ing the University’s annual Phi
Beta Kappa-Society of the Cincinnati
Convocation. Shortened classes will
be held so that students can attend
the voluntary assembly honoring the
Phi Beta Kappa men.

The Phi Beta Kappa picture for
the Calyx will be taken in front
of Washington Hall at 1:00 p.m.
on Friday, March 12.

Phi Beta Kappa is the oldest
Greek-letter fraternity in the United
States. It was founded at William and
Mary in 1776. Early secrecy was
abandoned after criticism, and since
1846 the society has been strictly an
honorary scholastic fraternity. Mem-
bership in Phi Beta Kappa has long
been one of the highest academic
distinctions.

The purpose of the organization is
to recognize and encourage scholar-
ship and cultural interests. Qualifica-
tions for membership are high schol-
schip, liberal culture, and good
character.

Gamma Chapter

Washington and Lee's local chap-
ter, Gamma of Virginia, was found-
ed in 1911 with ten members. Since
that date the chapter has annually
conferred membership on students
| with outstanding academic records. It
now has over 600 living members

Gamma Chapter considers each
graduating class by itself, not by
comparsion with other classes. Elec-
tion is not based on any fixed per-
centage of the class and there is no
strict numerical requirement for
for membership

Election Procedure

Election of academic seniors is
based on seven semesters of work
Occasionally, however, a senior is
chosen who has made an improve-
in his grades during his eighth and
final semester of college. This year
three such students were elected to
membership. Election of LL.B. can-
didates is based primarily upon law

Unjust, Unreasonable

The University Absence Regulations provide that a
student who takes one unexcused absence beyond the
cuts regularly allowed him shall be dropped from the
course he cuts with a grade of “F.” Why? Does it show
in any way that he may not have mastered the material
in the course? Does it even show that he is not performing
the required work in the course? Of course not.

Then why fail the student for one overcut? The
reasoning is obviously that with such a penalty, students
will be careful not to take unexcused absences. This is
true, but it is also true that class attendance could be se-
cured by other means—means which would not needlessly
risk students’ college careers by failing them for one over-
cut. It seems to us that the penalty of overcutting should
be one which is on a level with the seriousness of the
“offense.” To fail a student in a course is much too serious
a punishment for one overcut; it might mean that a man
could flunk out of school for oversleeping one morning.

Moreover, the penalty for overcutting should be one
reasonably related to the “infraction.” That is, since un-
excused absences are really a disciplinary problem, the
penalty should be a disciplinary matter also, not the most
final of academic punishments.

Last year the faculty voted to liberalize the cut system,
giving the majority of students sufficient cuts to allow
them to cut practically as they please, which should be the
right of any man of college age and ability. But at the
same time, the faculty actually tightened up on the rule on
overcuts, reducing the margin at which an “F” will be
awarded from two unexcused absences to only one. There
is little reason and no justice in giving an “F” for over-
cutting in the first place, so why tighten up on the rule?
Again, this is a fear measure to force compliance with the
limits of the new cut system.

We do not believe the students of Washington and
Lee need this rule, nor that they deserve it. If there must
be such a rule at all, it should at least be backed by a pen-
alty fitting for the “infraction” it exists to prevent. Extra
“homework” would be just such a penalty.

 

Fair Election*Plan

The plan for a two-party political system proposed in
the Ring-tum Phi two weeks ago has been attacked for
being impractical. Inevitably such far-reaching reform
will be impractical to many people, since it is impossible to
change without stepping on toes. But opposed to personal
considerations—which are generally the essence of the
plan’s “impracticality”—is the welfare of student govern-
ment itself. Student government demands an improvement
in the corrupt method in which its officers are selected.

We will be the first to admit that the two-party system
plan will be difficult to implement. Indeed what is more
difficult, unwieldy, more impractical than any form of
democratic government? But though it will be difficult to
undertake, the plan is workable—in contrast to the status
quo, which is unbearable.

Basically, the Ring-tum Phi plan, or the Fair Election
Plan, as it has become known, is to establish under the
supervision of the Executive Committee two relatively
equal parties who will nominate their candidates, in open
primaries. To ensure that the Cliques don’t rig primaries
by passing the word as to the “acceptable” candidates,
the primaries will be administered by an Elections Com-
mittee, consisting of EC members from both parties and
the chairman of both parties. Probably such a system
could only be established by a vote of the student body
to incorporate it into the constitution.

Criticism of this plan to date has been aimed mainly
at the original creation of equal parties, and at the compli-
cations involved in a primary system. Both these points
are essential to open and fair elections. The first, creation
of equal parties, is the sine qua non of any improvement.
At present there is only one party, whose candidates are
assured of election; this party can nominate without re-
gard for their candidates’ fitness for office. If there were
equal parties, each party would have to be careful to nom-
inate men qualified for office.

Perhaps the quickest way for equal parties to be cre-
ated is for the EC to ask the nine houses who are presently
not organized to form a new party in opposition to the
University Party. The main objection to such a move is
that these nine houses might not be politically compatible.
However, this objection is a very weak one, since the party
shifts in the last four years have seen every house on
campus affiliated with almost every other house, volun-
tarily, at one time or another.

The second point of criticism is that the primaries are
too much trouble. Certainly a primary election would be
one more election for students to go through, but we
think this is a price worth paying. A primary election for
student body offices would require a meeting of each party
in one place, which may be unprecedented but is certianly
not an impossibility. The commons, the gym, or probably
even Lee Chapel could hold such meetings.

The primary elections for student body and class EC
offices would entail several ballotings in order to allow
men defeated for one nomination to run for a lower nomi-
nation. This would take some time, but not an inordinate
amount of time. It is a process which would probably
excite new interest in campus elections, since it would be
free of Clique control and open for any interested stu-
dent. We believe that students would not begrudge the
extra time, indeed that they might enjoy such primaries,

Apathy Saps Traditional Values

By JIM De YOUNG
Tuesday Columnist

Quality in education concerns
every one of us today. At W&L we
have this quality
and it has been
our strength that
we always have |
been able to pro- |
duce an effective
public image. It
has been our]
weakness at times
that so much em-
phasis has been
placed on this im-
age, and that the
reality has often
failed to measure up to it. This fault
is caused not by re@alcitrance on the
part of our student body but by
apathy and indifference.

   

De Young

Honor Convenient

Students often appear not to ap-
preciate the honor system or con-
ventional dress. However, I do ack-
nowledge the fact that the matter
of academic convenience is more im-

portant than the matter of dress. Yet
in recent articles in the Ring-tum
Phi, there have been numerous de-
fenses made for the honor system
and conventional dress, but in all of
these articles, there has been no
mention of what I consider the ob-
vious.

Above all, the honor system is a
system of convenience and rare priv-
ilege. It is for the students at W&L,
and each boy who comes here is
made aware of the system. Each par-
ent of a student is required to sign
a statement indicating that he under-
stands the workings of the honor
system. And when a boy enters
W&L, he ean be sure that he is
competing on the same level with
every other student. Futhermore,
when a boy leaves W&L, he does
so because he has broken the agree-
ment he tacitly accepted when he
came to Washington and Lee.

Conventional Dress

As for conventional dress, I suggest
that its detractors travel to other
colleges and  universities—Miami,

Cornell, and Princeton—and take a
good look at the students there. The
only observation I can make is that
we are lucky to have conventional
dress there, and that it is no wonder
that the many men who interview
here always comment on how well
a W&L man dresses and handles
himself, and how fortunate the school
is to have such a value inculeated in
its students.

Yet a good many students here
do not really have any sense of pride
regarding either of these values. The
W&L student would do well to be-
come aware of his role as a leader of
tomorrow. Amd he should place
much more value and emphasis on
having a true sense of responsibility.
This responsibility comes only when
the student is able to transcend his
own selfish aims and become aware
of the existence of forces and move-
ments outside of and far more im-
portant than himself. Everyone of us
can contribute our part to maintain-
ing these values and realize just how
valuable and meaningful they are to
us who attend W&L.

What happened was that I got a

a junior at Ampersand University
He sent me a clipping from the
Ampersand Cipher, and a note ask-
ing me to come down immediately.
The clipping concerned a psychia-

Obviously, it was up te me to check
him out

“You don't understand. I want to

“Go right in.” He jammed his
thumb over his shoulder, then licked
it.

I went through the door which
said: Dr, Leipzig Munzinger, Psy-

etching on the wall entitled “Alice

“Who...are you?”

I spun around, startled. Dr. Mun-
zinger had been hiding behind the
door.

“Crowley, Sir.”

Munzinger marched briskly to his
desk, took a puff on his cigar, gave
a cursory glance at the appointment
sheet, and raised an eyebrow

“A.M.?"

I nodded.

“Well, what can I do for you?”

“I want to be excused from P.E.,

Munzinger lay down on the couch,

For an instant, his whole body

wildly at his desk top.

“Quick! Two oranges, three greens
and a purple!” he gasped. I handed
him all the bettles on the desk, but
he just glared at me. “These aren't

bles! Marbles!” He smashed them on
the floor, then began crawling
around on all fours, sobbing violent-
ly and gathering up the brightly
colored objects in his trembling
hands.

“T've lost my marbles,” he whimp-
ered. “My marbles. My marbles!”

Just then the school doctor stuck
his head in the door and gazed at
Munzinger with evident disgust:

“Two greens, a red and three

To the Editer:

The Friday staff of the Ring-tum
Phi published two editorials in its
March 5 edition which indicates
that the Friday edition is grossly
misinformed upon subjects it wishes
to editorialize.

In one editorial entitled, “Tradi-
tional Evesore,” the Friday editor re-
marks concerning the Old Co-op,
“The Ring-tum Phi would like to
ask the administration just what its
plans for the building are? Thus far
ro one really seems to know.” If the
Editor had bothered to attend the
opening University Assembly, he
would have heard President Colc
very definitely remark that next vear
the present University Book Siore
and soda shop would be moved into
the Old Co-op and the ROTC depart-
ment would move into the present

brary more space

Student Rights

In Academics

by ROY TYLER
Tuesday Columnist

How far does “academic freedom”
go? The students at the University
of California believe it went far
enough to warrant riots and sit-ins
when they thought it was being
denied.

First, however, what is
freedom” and what does it guaran-
tee? “Academie freedom” can be in-
terpreted to mean and guarantec
anything, just as the word “freedom”
has so many interpretations as people
to interpret it.

One interpretation is that it allows
a professor to teach any subject in
any manner from any point of view
he wishes to teach from. This, how-
ever, can lead to serious problems.

How many times have you heard,
“T really want to take that course,
but the guy who teaches it is a rant-
ing, raving————_"? A great deal
often depends on the position of the
person making the statement, but
certain professors, even entire de-
partments, teach their courses from
one and only one political point of
view.

Does “academic freedom” allow a
professor to slant his teaching to
fit his own political outlook? Does
“academic freedom” allow a profes-
sor to teach a course in such a
manner that it will keep a student
who does not quite agree with the
professor from taking his course?
What if the course is a required one?

There is no reason, however, ‘to ask
for censorship of classroom lectures.
This, needless to say, would be ridic-
ulous. The object of this column is
not to call for any official or even
unofficial action on the part of the
administration, but only to ask the
faculty to restrain themselves from
certain “excesses” with regard to
partisanship in the classroom.

A prime example of this was the
dismissal of a scheduled class prior
to the election. After a short lecture
on the merits of one of the candi-
dates, a professor asked his class to
accompany him to aid in the distri-
bution of literature. One might ex-
pect this during an election, but a
great deal of this has continued.

In some courses a student's grade
is in danger of being lowered if he
merely disagrees with the professor
who teaches the course. This is not
merely rumor but the opinion of past
student leaders who have had to
keep silent when they disagree with
something a professor said beeause
their response would endanger their
grade.

It goes without saving that this
sort of thing should not go on. Na-
turally students want to know both
sides of the picture. If their are
reasons why “right-to-work”
should be maintained, students
would like to hear them instead ol
a constant one-sided criticism of the
laws.

There will be cries of protest con-
cerning the “police state” which
censorship of classwork would en-
tail. But there is no reason for cen-
sorship, only the relization by
fessors that there are two sides to
every picture and there are students
who do not think as they do

With this in mind, could we go
over the section dealing with labor
unions again?

“osceidemie

laws

pro-

 

sity in courses above 150. Thirdly,
the Editor states that it takes only
six hours to complete the
requirement, when the actual re-
quired figure is eight hours.

While admittedly these inaccur-
acies may seem trivial, in the future
the Editor should be well informed
and better informed on subjeets on
which he chooses to write. Needless
10 say, inaccuracies and misquota-
tions in journalism tend to throw a
bad light on a newspaper staff

door’ and soon there would be a
plea for more concessions. With
the proposed form of socialized med-
icine the government would be tell-
ing graduates what to specialize in
and where, thus taking away what
little incentive there is left to enter
the medical profession. Considering
the cost, says Dr. Shaver, the figure
would be around $35 billion and “if
you put the U.S. government in on
it, then you can just double that
figure.”

The next speaker was Mr. Foristel,
who is a lawyer and an Assistant
General Council for the Department
of Health, Edueation and Welfare.
He explained that such a program
would be revolutionary in that

the existing policy of the Assimila-

Poll Was Vague

This does not mean, however, that
we have ruled out the possibility
that strong feelings regarding change
do exist, but rather only that we
have not been able to definitely pin-
point this through the referendum
or other student action. If there is
in facet a substantially strong feeling
of dissatisfaction among the stu-
dents, we on the EC wish that some
consistent, positive and definite sug-
gestions be brought before us. We
then will try, as accurately as pos-
sible, to act in a manner reflect-
ing what is demonstrated to be a
majority of student opinion.

ed a program of aid for those who
can help themselves’—the proposed
Medicare bill would provide aid for
all people over sixty-five regardless
of need. He pointed to the fact that
no other benefit program in Ameri-
ca administered to those who did
not really need help.

Mr. Foristel went on to explain
the position of the American Medical
Association which would accept the
bill as feasible only under three con-
ditions: 1. the aid must be restricted
to those who have a need; 2. the
benefits must be administered to
people at a local or state level; 3. it
must not involve the use of Social
Security funds.

Foristel described the Eldercare
or Herlong-Curtis legislation being
supported by the AMA; under this
proposed plan, the elderly group
would be divided into three cate-
gories according to their need as
determined by statements of income
and health, and the medical serv-
ices would be alloted accordingly.
He completed his talk by pointing
out the high standards attained by
modern medicine in the United
States and issued strong encourage-
ment to college graduates to take the
initiative and pursue a career in
medicine—“we have a big decision
confronting us today, for we must

realize that socialized medicine is
never the end of socialism, it’s the
beginning!”

The final panelist was the Honor-
able Jack Marsh, a member of the
House of Representatives from the
Seventh Congressional District, a
graduate in law from Washington
and Lee, a veteran of World War II,
who was recognized as the most out-
standing young man in Virginia | in

JIM REDENBAUGH OR RICK CARRELA,

 

1959. His topic was “What the Ulti-
mate Bill May Be?”, and he began
by saying that we must first examine
the need; the advances of technoligy
have resulted in longevity of life
and thus created a social problem
that must be resolved by the indi-
vidual. Senior citizens who have
need as well as many others are put-
ting pressure on Washington to ar-
rive at a solution suitable to all and
steps are being undertaken to rem-
edy the situation. Rep. Marsh goes
on to suggest feasible approaches in-
cluding a Welfare System, and he
discusses the advantages of the
omnibus King-Anderson bill which
s “a highly technical piece of legis-
lation.”

The Medicare bill is a Revenue
Bill emerging from the Ways and
Means committee, and Rep. Marsh
mentioned that the voting by sec-
tions on the bill would begin short-
ly. He went on to say that the final
product would probably be a hybrid
of the various bills now under con-
sideration; he concluded by saying
that “we need a dedication and a re-
dedication in re-emphasis on the
pursuit of a career in medicine.”

The symposium was followed by
a short period in which students
were given an opportunity to ask
questions and express their opinions.

called it simply, “coats and ties.” At

Letters To The Editor

\things taught,

 

The debate is open to all students | ary interest, and in addition meant
and faculty and especially those con- jas a compliment to you and to the

will be ample opportunity for dis- |

the values of which
occur later.

I do not challenge your question-
ing the reason. In fact, 1 now wonder
at my own dullness for not having
done so. However, I do submit a
reversal of your thesis. I suggest in-
stead of the need for innovations in
our significant systems, it may be in
some cases more important to pro-
vide protections.

In this instance, after submitting
the practice to thorough review you
were to find it time proven and de-
serving, then the issue should be-
come one of preservation. The mean-
ingfulness of conventional dress ten
years ago or in Lee’s time is in
question today. Innovation and
change is suggested, so that man-
ner of dress might conform with the
need of the present. This is an up-
grading of an idea and conforms with
the principles of progress. However,
who will preserve the benefits of
today’s innovation, ten years hence?
The answer might be, let there be
another innovation ten years hence
to meet the condition of that day,
and so on. If that is the real answer,
then the final question has to be;
is there no place for the continuity
of a proven idea ‘to be passed from
one generation to another?

My letter does not ask for an
answer or acknowledgement. It is
merely an expression of contempor-

others in your student body who, it
is apparent, are thinking.
Sincerely yours,

ANEW PROGRAM OF INTEREST TO

 

It isn’t easy to become an officer in the United
States Army. Only the best young men are selected.
The training and course of study are demanding.
But if you can qualify—and you should find out

if you can—you will receive training which will put
you a step ahead of other college graduates. Army

aging other men, in organizational techniques, in
self-discipline and in speaking on your feet. This
, kind of experience will pay off in everything you

do the rest of your life.

Army ROTC has a new program designed spe-~
cifically for outstanding men who already have

two years of college, and plan

college work. During your junior and senior years
in this program, you will receive $40 per month,
Want to find out more about the program? Simply

Friday Edition

Don’t Miss It

CONTACT, less than a year ago only a dream, began this
afternoon at 2 p.m. when Dr. James W. Silver conducted a
seminar on “The Lack of Leadership in the Anti-Bellum
South.” This symposium stands as proof of one of the positive
goals for which Washington and Lee’s Interfraternity Council
can strive and, indirectly, as a worthwhile project of the cam-
pus’s fraternities.

It should be remembered, however, that the purpose of
CONTACT is not for the Interfraternity Council, the Uni-
versity, or CONTACT’s Steering Committee—they have al-
ready completed their task in bringing such a symposium to
our campus. The purpose of CONTACT Weekend was, and
still is, to provide the students of W&L with a program of an
intellectual nature and scope. In effect, CONTACT is an ex-
periment to see if our student body wants a program of this
nature.

The symposium itself has purposely been constructed so as
to include as wide a spectrum of student interest as is possible.
It has been quite successful in getting men like Dr. Silver,
Thomas G. Wicker, Colonel Francis Pickens Miller, Douglass
Cater, C. P. Ives and James R. Echols. Topics will vary from
the timely Civil Rights question facing the nation to questions
concerning how Europeans view American college students
traveling abroad.

The weekend will not be a dull, monotonous series of lec-
tures, but rather a series of talks made by men who are ex-
cellent speakers and who possess a real knowledge of their sub-
ject matter. Roundtable discussions will allow students to ask
questions concerning major issues.

Non-attendance will hurt no one, but yourself. An op-
portunity has been made available for our students and the stu-
dents of neighboring institutions to participate in a very worth-
while program. CONTACT is “an adventure into intellectual
exposure’—an adventure no member of our student body

should allow himself to miss. W.D.C.

Best Of Both Systems

From all indications a vote will be taken at Monday night's
Executive Committee meeting concerning the fate of campus
politics and the clique system at W&L. A report from a special
sub-committee now investigating the feasibility of a change
is expected at that time. The Friday Edition of the Ring-tum
Phi fully supports the new revision in the student government's
election process.

Although the exact wording of the proposal will not be
made public until Monday’s meeting, it is known that the
the report will contain the best features of Steve Smith’s pro-
posals: open primaries and elected political chairmen; and the
counter-proposal of EC member Rick Carrell. Basically, the
clique system will remain but only to facilitate the election
process and not to nominate candidates. Direct Primaries will
replace the old nominating process, eliminating “rule by the
clique.”

It is the hope of our paper that this proposal will meet
with the speedy approval of the Executive Committee, allow-
ing a referendum to be presented to the student body before
Spring elections. We feel that such a change is both needed

and necessary if our University is to enjoy the best student
leadership. W. D.C.

Robison Biel Revisited

In response to last week's editorial, the only defense that
we have heard for requiring the completion of a language
through the 201-202 level is that the majority of students do
this in one or two years. Dr. Linton L. Barrett, head of the
Romance Language department wrote: “there is no ‘three-
year language requirement’; it does not take eighteen hours to
graduate with a B.A. degree except for a minority.” If it exists
for a minority, how can you say that it does not exist? In statis-
tics provided for us by Dean Atwood's office, it is a three-year
language requirement for 26 per cent of this year’s freshman
class and 30 per cent of last year's. This percentage will become
smaller when part of this group applies for a B.S. degree, but
were it to exist as a three-year requirement for only | per cent
of the student body, we would still feel that we have a valid
criticism. The emphasis laid upon foreign language in the
courses which Washington and Lee prescribes for a liberal arts
education is excessive.

 

 

 

Since last week's editorial on this subject we have received

a number of letters correcting certain inaccuracies that ap-
peared in it. We gratefully acknowledge these and regret that
we were unable to correct them ourselves before we went to
press. In the responses which we have received, however, no
one has taken it upon themselves to defend the three-year
language requirement. If it is justifiable that a student be
forced to take eighteen hours in a course for which he might
neither have the aptitude nor interest, we would like to know
why.

We would also like to ask that the three-year language re-
quirement be taken into consideration by one of our present
Self-Study committees. While we are aware that a detailed
study of the curriculum was made only two years ago, we feel
that valuable improvements could be made in our program
for a liberal education, if a committee could take the time to
listen to student criticism of this requirement.

 

 

 

Students Decry Injustice
Of Overcut Consequences

Dear Dean Atwood,

Monday, Charles Milne, a fresh-
man Robert E. Lee Scholar, over-
cut his Religion class because of
circumstances which we feel were
beyond his control. He was stranded
in Washington with no money and
could not hitehhike back in time to
attend his class. Because of this he
will receive a grade of F in Religion,
a course in which he had not even
taken a test. Charles appealed his
case to a faculty committee but his
plea was denied on the grounds that
he could have borrowed money for
bus fare from local police or a travel
burea.

Just recently another freshman
overcut a class when he over-slept.
His appeal to his professor not to
fail him was successful. Charles’
professor was not in when Charles
went to see him. As was previously
stated, his appeal to the faculty com-
mittee was then denied.

We feel that Charles has been
wronged. In the first place it is
absurd to allow a man of Charles’
intelligence and ability only three
cuts per class. Most high schools
allow more absences than this. Is
a man’s work judged by his at-
tendance in class? If so, perhaps
many people who have failed out
of school but have attended all
their classes should be readmitted
and given A’s for perfect attend-
ance. Is a man any less intelligent,
has he gotten any less from a
course by making an A after not
attending his class than the man
whe made a C and did attend?

Furthermore, why ruin a student's

 

 

chances in a course because of an!
absence he couldn't help? A flagrant|

and intentional violation of the cut

system is one thing, but an auto-

is asinine.

Columnist Analyzes Assimilation
Principles, Procedures, Codes

By JIMMY KIERSKY

Have you ever noticed an unusual
amount of ears outside of the Stu-
dent Union Building on Wednesday
nights? If you don’t know why they
are there, consider yourself fortu-
nate. The Assimilation Committee
holds their meetings then for the
purpose of disciplining those who
violate the assimilation rules.

It all starts out when some one
breaks one of these traditions or
rules. These traditions include con-
ventional dress, speaking, and walk-
ing on the grass (forbidden to fresh-
men only.) When one violates one of
these rules he is sometimes assimi-
lated.

The process of assimilating
someone is not very difficult, All
one does is fill out one of the as-
similation cards and place it in one
of the seven bexes around the
campus. Boxes are located in
Evans Dining Hall, Howe Hall, the
library, and Washington Hall, to
name a few. After the card is
turned in, the Assimilation Com-
mittee takes over.

The secretary of the Committee
collects the cards and he mails out
post cards requesting the violator
to appear before the Committee at
a certain time on some Wednesday

The students comes to the Stu-
dent Union Building. When he is
admitied to the room, he is con-
fronted by the nine members of
the Committee. They go over his
offense and he is asked if he denies
it. If he does and keeps the honor
system in mind, the offender is
let off. If he admits it, he is then
disciplined according to the deci-
sion of the Committee.

Most offenders are let off with
a warning that if they appear before
the Committee again they will have
to answer for both charges. Others
are fined one dollar if it is their
first offense. Those who are fined
are usually flagrant violators or in-
tentional violators.

The principal punishment is by
fine. Brooks Brown, chairman of the
Assimilation Committee, then turns
the money, obtained through fines,
over to the student Body Fund. The

Student Body Fund is handled by

the Executive Committee.

help every student orient himself to-
ward graduate school or the business
world. To find such a program as
this, one must consider the value and
need of introducing independent study
to the W&L academic program.

If W&L is to provide the quality
of education which would be suit-
able to a school of its caliber, it must
begin to foster a more intellectual
atmosphere. Such an atmosphere
can best be found in the college
where each student is given the op-
portunity to stand upon his own
ability to do independent research
in the subject which most attracts
his interest and curiosity.

A program of individual self-study
should be planned and carried out by
the student under the guidance of a
faculty member. The idea of inde-
pendent study is to allow the stu-
dent a program for cultivating a par-
ticular interest either in his major or
in another subject. That is, such a pro-
gram as this would give the student
an opportunity to become an expert
in a specific subject.

Such a program should not be de-
signed to take the place of a major
but rather to supplement the major.

study program becomes the means
by which one may help to satisfy a
particular intellectual curiosity and
at the same time prove his compe-

curriculum one step closer in bridg-
ing the gap between graduate and
undergraduate teaching methods.
How the program should be estab-
lished without taking time away from
the normal academic routine of the
student presents a problem. One solu-
tion is that independent study should
be begun in the freshman or sopho-
more year, whenever the student has
picked a subject on which he would
like to concentrate. For example, an
English major might pick the Ro-
mantic movement or even more spe-
cifically one writer during this peri-
od, as the subject matter for self

AAUP Gives ‘B’ Rating;
Faculty Averages $10,452

$9,552. Washington and Lee pays pro-
fessors an average of $10,452. These
figures indicate that UVa. with an
average remuneration in the $10,500
to $10,999 bracket surpasses W&L as
the school with the highest compen-
sation scale in Virginia.

Washington and Lee compares
even less favorably with institutions
of like character, interests, and size.
Average faculty salaries at Amherst
range between $13,500 and $13,999;
Haverford and Wesleyan between
$12,000 and $13,000; and Sewanee and
Williams, between $11,000 and
$11,499. Davidson, Hamilton, Trinity,
Kenyon and Lehigh all rank below
W&L. Amherst pays the highest sal-
aries in the nation. Of the Southern
schools, Duke’s wage scale is number
one. The AAUP report further grades
only 13 of 76 Southern private in-
stitution in the “A” category, 50 in
the “B” bracket, and 13 in “C.”

Interestingly enough, instructors at
Washington and Lee receive bigger
relative salaries than professors of
higher standing. The AAUP gives
a grade “A” for instructors’ compen-
sation, “B” for assistant professors,
“B” for associate professors, and “B”
plus for full professors. Thus in-
structors here are paid as well as
anywhere in the nation.

The University has made advances
in this area of particular concern,
The 1962 AAUP report gave W&L
a “C” rating. The past two years have
seen in an increase of approximately
one thousand dollars in average fae-
ulty salaries. Yet further progress is
imperative if the University will
continue to attract men of outstand-
ing ability and purpose to strengthen
its academic offerings.

 

Chaplain Mustachely Visits
Lexington For First Time
To Get A Birdseye View

By BRUCE W. RIDER

One fine morning not long ago |
was trotting merrily, merrily down
one of our many nice little Washing-
ton and Lee walks
(Ah! Lexington in
springtime! Ah...).
I soon came upon
a small nervous
man who was in

about our fair

campus.

holder of that Tra-

tum Phi about our nice fraterni-

never been in Lexington before and
I just thought I'd take a quiet look
around.”

“Most certainly, Chaplain, Sir, Be
our guest.”

“Excuse me, kind student that you
are, but have you dated at Falling?”

“Yes, I have.”

“Did you ever, um, throw up on
our chapel?”

“Well, now that you ask, yes. It
was right after one of your sermons,
if I remember correctly.”

“Oh, I see.”

“Say, Mr. Chaplain, Sir, just why
are you wriling so many

Season With 60-58 Loss

Winter Trackmen Close
|

By JOHN GRAHAM

Friday Sports Writer
In its last contest of the winter
season, the W&L track team dropped
a 68-50 decision to Bridgewater Col-

lege last night at the VMI field
house.
The loss leaves the Generals at

1-2 for the indoor season, the lone
win coming last week against Roa-
noke College. The Maroons returned
last night for a meet with the W&L
freshmen, and prevailed 68-24,

The field events, usually a Gen-
eral strong point, proved the undoing
of the track men last night. Bridge-
water showed amazing strength, win-
ning every one of the five field
events, and piling up a 31-14 lead
going into the running contests.

The running events were fairly
evenly matched, with the visitors
holding a 37-36 point edge. All told,
the Generals won only four of the
14 events, and only their eight sec-
ond-place finishes kept things close.

On the positive side of the register,
the Generals won both of the relay

 

events. The quarter mile team of|
Chris Kell, Spencer Sullivan, Rob
Orr, and Bob Bigham won in the
time of :47.1. The mile realy team|
of Kell, Bigham, Rick Meiser and |
John Wiley, the latter two fresh- |
men, won their event with a 3:144
clocking the over 220 rubberized as-
phalt track.

Kell and Bigham also won the!
only two individual victories for the
Generals, Sprint-specialist Kell took
the 60-yard dash with a 6.6 clocking.
Bigham, out of action the end of
last season with a injured foot, cap-
tured the 600-yard run in 1:17.38.

Other than these two bright spots,
it was a sad night for the Generals.
Bridgewater placed two men in the
top three in six events, and swept
all three places in the high jump.

The outdoor season opens on
Thursday at the University of Rich-
mond at a meet billed as “polar bear”
by head coach Norm Lord. The Gen-
erals have one other meet, a contest
with Old Dominion on March 26, be-
fore spring vacation.

Tennis Prospects Look Good

By GUY UNANGST

Washington and Lee coach Verne
Canfield has the material to go from
an almost all-losing (2-17) season in
basketball to an almost all-winning
season in tennis.

Canfield has six returning letter-
men, a bevy of good freshmen and a
field of 35 to work with.

He’s been running his team since
practice began, and has only this week
sent them to the courts. Trouble is, he
hasn't enough room for them all to
play.

Top Three Players

Jim De Young, Randy Jones and
Lindsay Short, all seniors, are the
top three players. Other lettermen are
Fred Webb, Forest Dickinson and
Howard Busse.

 

Phil Thompson, who played No. 1)

on last year’s freshman team, also has
a chance to break into one of the six
singles spots.

The best of the freshmen are Buddy
Atkins, Steve and David Greenia,
Wieck Vellines and Pete Swart. Can-
field said there is a good chance some
or all of these will play on the var-
sity before the year is out.

Defense, Size,

Depth Main

Baseball 'Team Problems

By LOCK HANDLEY

Defense is the key to W&L’s base-
ball fortunes this year, according to
coach Joe Lyles.

After three weeks of practice, most
of it indoors, Lyles expressed plea-
sure with the team’s hustle and held
out hope for substantial improvement
over last year’s 2-8-1 finish. The squad
is led by nine returning lettermen
and bolstered by the return of in-
fielder Eric Sisler, a .370 hitter his
freshman year.

Lyles’ main worries are lack of
depth and small size. With a team av-
eraging 5’ 9” and 160 pounds, the Gen-
erals will be unable to play for the
big inning and will have to rely on

pitching and infield defense to keep
opponent run totals down.

The horsehiders have two depen-
dable starters in senior Chris Wigert,
the staff's lone southpaw, and sopho-
more Pete Heumann. Lyles has high
hopes of freshman Bill Rasmussen as
a third starter. Others pitchers are
returning sophomores Jim Cooper,
Terry Herman, and Dick Masters.

Depth problems may hurt the Gen-
erals at first base as well. Tri-cap-
tain Skip Chase is the only man list-
ed at the position, although Jim Croth-
ers saw some action there last year.
The rest of the infield seems solid,
with Sisler at third, Dave Kirkpat-
rick (called by Lyles “our best ball-
players last year” at short, and either
letterman Mike Saunders or freshman
Larry Perrault as second. Ed Bishop

W&L Linksmen
To Shoot For
Perfect Season

An unbeaten record will be within
reach of Washington and Lee’s golf
team for the first time in many years.

With six returning lettermen, all
consistently in the 70's, the team
should win all its dual meets and do
well in the Virginia Intercollegiate
Tournament and the College Athlet-
ic Conference Tournament, perhaps
winning both.

Last year’s team was 5-1 in dual
meets.

Ed Crosland, the captain, will play
No, 1. Other lettermen are Dick Drew,
Dave Carroll, Bob Duckwall, Roger
Sennott and Jeff Skarda. E. P. “Cy”
Twombly coaches the team.

Home matches will be played at
Hot Springs Country Club, Boons-
boro Country Club in Lynchburg
or Tribrook Country Club. The sched-

men, Skip Jacobsen, Guy Townley,
and Arnie Vedlitz, are also trying
for the spot.

In addition to their lack of depth
and small size, the horsehiders suffer
from a lack of lefthanded hitting, with
Allen, Chase, Crothers, and Wigert
(a fine hitting pitcher) the squad’s
only southpaws. On the credit side,
Lyles cites his core of experienced

| sophomores and the return to a full

practice schedule of Wigert and Al-
len.

After an intrasquad game and possi-
ble scrimmage with VMI, the Gen-
erals will first see action in a scrim-
mage with New Haven College here
on March 22, at 3:15. The regular
season opens March 27, against Elon
College.

Prospects for the Elon game are not
too good, according to Lyles. The Car-
olinians have enjoyed better practice
weather all spring, and will have five
games under their belt when they face
W&L.

Notice

The regular weekly meeting of
SPEPOOJCA scheduled for tonight
has been postponed. The next meet-
ing will be Monday night at the
usual meeting place.

CONTACT Speakers Available
For Discussions With Students

(Continued from page 1)

Cater will talk on “The Genesis of
the Great Society” tomorrow night,
treating the increasing sensivivity of
the Federal Government to all areas
of American development, and the
relation of President Johnson’s Great
Society program to this new empha-
sis.

On Sunday afternoon C. P. Ives,
Associate Editor of the Baltimore
Sun, will speak on “Operation Un-
check”—the government's apparent
movement away from the traditional
system of checks and balances as
implied in the Constitution, His talk
will emphasize both the political and
economic implications of this “Am-
erican Experiment.”

Later Sunday afternoon, a tea,
similar to tomorrow's coffee, will
permit interested persons to discuss
the ideas represented by CONTACT’s
speakers directly with them.

Sunday night, Col. Francis P. Mil-
ler, himself a W&L graduate, will
close this year’s CONTACT series
with an address directed to “Amer-
icans Abroad and Their Tasks,” a
critique of so many American citi-
zens’ insensitivity to foreign affairs
and problems and the need for a bal-
anced foreign policy. Col. Miller, who
is Special Assistant in the Bureau
for Cultural and Educational Af-
fairs of the State Department, will

None of the things I've said are in-

it into a means of outrageous self-es-

from vital issues we need to face,

If the Honor System is to be sup-

justifying it with absurd half-truth
sentimentalities and illogical interpola-
tions.

there is a lack of interest.

Larry Meeks, refuting Simpson's

suggested system would be more un-
democratic than the present one in de-
nying freedom of association of inter-
ests, especially when one considers
that the member houses are obliged to
support the party financially as well as
politically. Price, in his cross-examin-
ation of Meeks, questioned whether
the current system has a broad-enough
representation to justify its continu-

study.

The next step would be to set up
a program under the supervision of
a faculty member from the English
department—a program which would
call for two, three, or more hours
of work every week outside of the
classroom. The student need only
spend that amount of time which he
could well afford to take away from
his normal study routine.

Such a program begun in the
sophomore year should give great
satisfaction to the student who pur-
sues it for two or three years. The
program should be dropped any
time the student loses interest in his
subject. For that matter a student
should have the freedom to begin
the program whenever he chooses,
even as late as his junior or senior
year. If the student’s independent
study is of sufficient quality, it is
possible that the head of the de-
partment in which the student is a
major may allow him to replace one
or two subjects of his major with
additional time for research and in-
dependent study. Of course, the stu-
dent must produce results,

One may ask if W&L doesn’t have

honor programs to carry out the pur-
pose of self-study. Yet only a small
percentage of the student body qual-
ify for research scholarships and hon-
or programs (limited to the senior
class). An independent study program
gives to the average and good stu-
dent an opportunity and encourage-
ment to achieve individual accom-
plishment in a specific academic sub-
ject.

It would appear that such a pro-
gram might help to increase the in-
itiative of students to tackle academ-
ic problems which have not yet been
solved or exhausted by their teach-
ers. A program of independent study
also increases the intellectual curi-

academic excellence of those stu-
dents who participate in it. Still an-
other benefit of such a program
would be a closer association be-
tween student and teacher in plan-
ning the program and evaluating its
results.

Above all, a program of indepen-

ual gain confidence in his ability to

el, or at least point him toward the
graduate method of teaching.

Che Ring-tum Phi

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

Tuesday Edition

Unjust, Unreasonable

The current uproar over a freshman, Charles Milne,
who was given an F in a course he overcut in circum-
stances which seem to have been beyond his control, draws
attention to a rule which deserves all the criticism that
can be directed at it. To drop a student from a class with
an F for taking one cut is not only unreasonably harsh, it
is also punishment unrelated to the infraction committed.

Probably most of the faculty will admit the injustice
of this rule, but it is retained because it is all that stands
between the student body and the horrors of unlimited
cuts. Assuming that there must be a cut system—and’
although the principle of the thing is insulting, at least in
practice the W&L system is liberal in the number of cuts
it allows—if there is to be such a system, then it should be
backed by a penalty fitting the infraction.

Last week the Ring-tum Phi suggested that the penalty
be extra homework. The administration greeted the pro-
posal with a chuckle. But nobody is laughing over the
number of students who have been given F’s for absences
in the last several years. Some change should be devised
to prevent this, and if extra work in the class in which
lectures are missed does not fit the bill, then perhaps a
heavy fine—say $25—is the answer. Students already face
smaller fines for cutting University Assemblies. Another
possible penalty is the one which was discarded a few
years ago in favor of the present F: loss of quality credits.
While this would still be too heavy a penalty, it could be
an improvement over the present one. Still another sug-
gestion: lower the cutting student’s grade in the course
affected by one letter grade for each overcut, rather than
giving him an F outright.

Any of these would be better than the present penal-
ty. However, the Ring-tum Phi is not at all convinced that
homework can be laughed off. By “homework,” of
course, we do not have in mind some mechanical exercise,
but a constructive task such as a book report or even a
research paper. It is a penalty which could be made as
light or as heavy as the student’s circumstances in the
course required. It would actually be helpful to the stu-
dent, and could obviously be designed to more than make
up for the lectures missed.

Objections to assigning homework, or extra papers,
for students who overcut, are two: it would create extra
work for professors, and it sounds “preppy.” Extra
work would place a heavier burden on the faculty, of
course: but there would not be much of it, and we would
hope that professors would rather grade an extra paper
from a student than see him receive an F he does not de-
serve. An alternative to the faculty’s extra work would be
for professors not to grade the extra work with the same
care they give their regular assignments.

The second objection to the proposal, that it smacks
of prep school, is also a valid argument. Yet if a home-
work penalty smacks of prep school, the present penalty
of awarding an F takes us back to the dark ages. There
is simply no way to avoid having a petty penalty—
or something worse, which is what we have now—for a
petty system. The cut system is a hand-slapping system
for a student body which the faculty does not consider
mature; the penalty ought to suit the system. Instead
of cutting the hand off, it should slap.

The Ring-tum Phi asks for some change to stop stu-
dents’ receiving F’s for overcutting. It does not seem
too much to ask that such a change be retroactive for
Charles Milne, the freshman who hitch-hiked to Wash-
ington last weekend in the expectation ot receiving there
the money to pay for a bus ticket back to Lexington, but
who could not obtain the money to get back in time for
Monday classes. Mr. Milne, a Robert E. Lee scholar, is
more than most an undeserving victim of a penalty which
almost no Washington and Lee student really deserves.

d Maturity

In “The Girl with the Green Eyes”

By WARD BRIGGS
Cinema Columnist
Presently at the Lyric is Girl with
Green Eyes, appropriately in black
and white. It stars
Rita Tushingham
as Kate, an Irish
country girl, who
her Cath-
olic family for the
first time and
tastes the freedom

of the city.

It seems as
though this whole
experience is a re-
creation of one of
Miss Tushingham’s
girlhood memories, just as the mar-
ried man she falls in love with is
the culmination of every quality
an inexperienced girl is likely to
have of her ideal lover.

Eugene Gaillard is mature, sophis-
tieated, considerate, and a writer.
Peter Finch is everything this girl
wishes for while still managing to
be a flesh and blood human, who is
lonely and listless, fascinated by
Kate’s innocence but bored by her
gaucherie and irritated by her pos-
sessiveness

leaves

 

 

 

Not an unkind man, but one who
has long understood the transitori-
ness of emotion. It is this sense of
inevitable heartbreak that gives the
film its underlying seriousness.

Kate’s fierce determination to
seize her happiness and hold on is
doomed from the start, but her
struggles are funny as well as sad,
sometimes farcical as the tragedies
of the very young often are. Even
such commonplace attempts as the
smoking of a cigarette end in humi-
liation when the burning weed slips
down her corsage and is doused by
a nicely aimed jug of cold milk.

But Kate is resilient, and in the
little epilogue which brings the film
to its slightly too abrupt close she
is seen finding new friends and in-
terests in London. Already her
experience with Eugene has become
part of the process of growing up.

The relationship between the two
is, of course, the central thread of
the film, but is woven into an amus-
ing appraisal of the Irish scene,
which never sinks to cynicism or bit-
terness, but takes the obvious way
to a cheap joke.

Kate and her best friend Baba are
neatly contrasted types of convent-

 

 

bred adolescents. Kate, played by
Rita Tushingham with wide-eyed
sensitivity, is a serious-minded girl
with a tender conscience. Her repres-
sive upbringing makes is impossible
for her to surrender to Eugene at
first, much as she wants to, and
these bedroom scenes are handled
with the admirable delicacy.

Baba, on the other hand, would
never have hesitated. With her, the
nuns have been wasting their time.
A slap-happy, mildly sluttish young
woman ,all brash confidence and ig-
norant bounce, she is brought to life
by Lynn Redgrave, in a debut of
startling brilliance.

Coming Thursday is The Prize,
starring Paul Newman and Elke

Sommer. The plot is so formidably
silly that you can’t but wonder why

the film-makers themselves didn’t
realize its absurdity.
Irving Wallace’s best seller took

itself far more solemnly; but Ernest
Lehman, scriptwriter of North By
Northwest has concocted out of the
book an engaging fantasy in which
the winner of the Nobel Prize for
literature (Newman) foils a Com-
munist plot to spirit the winner of

We may frankly admit at the

He assumes that we know the dis-

Out of all the brillance of this

the very earthy shepherdess, Phyl-

far superior to the present state of

| Win A Few..

By TOM CARPENTER |
The Sunday edition of the Wash-
ington Post contained a short article
dealing with three colleges applying
for membership in the Mason-Dixon
Conference. This article brings to
mind the point that has been dis-
cussed many times recently, Should
Washington and Lee remain in CAC?
Why not join the Mason-Dixon
Conference?

The three colleges hoping to be-
come members of the Mason-Dixon
Conference are Shephrd College of
West Virginia, Frederick College of
Portsmouth, and Richmond Profes-
sional Institute. All three are small
colleges about the size of W&L and
all have to scramble to get athletes
comparable to the ones at W&L.

Mason-Dixon Schools

Other schools in this conference

Lose A Few... |

 

are, for example, Hampden-Sydney
and Randolph-Macon. Neither of,
these schools has had any better)
football teams in recent years than)
those of the Generals.

Both have had outstanding basket-|
ball teams compared to those at]
W&L, but then basketball at W&L|}
has been deficient in recent time.
Only two teams in the conference,
Lynchburg and Macon, have had
with much talent
as those of coach Lyles’.

Money Being Wasted

The point is that W&L is wasting
money by playing in the CAC when
there exists a local conference with
schools on the athletic level
W&L. It seems that the athletic
department would rather spend
money on trips into Tennessee and
Kentucky to St. Louis when the}
money could be spent on improve-|
ments of the athletic facilities here}

at W&L.

Besides, the Generals have no right
being in the same conference with
Washington University. Washington
usually has one of the best small
college football teams in the nation
and this year qualified for the NAIA
small college basketball tournament.
Their ‘baseball team
looked like a prep team for the big
leagues. It was a tribute to the foot-
ball Generals that they came as
close as they did to Washington this
year.

In basketball in particular the
Generals have had very little suc-
cess in the CAC. Of course one
might add that the Generals have
had very little success, period, and
the Mason-Dixon Conference con-
tains small college basketball powers

like Hampden-Sydney and Ran-
dolph-Macon. But under Coach

Verne Canfield’s recruiting system,
within three the Generals
should be on par with both of these
schools.

years

Rivalries Will Develope

Another reason for a switch in
conferences the possibility that
W&L will develop one or two intra-
state rivalries that will bring about
an increased school spirit and also
in attendance. The only important
CAC rivalry exists between W&L
and Sewanee, and that one only in
football. Were Hampden-Sydney a
member of the same conference as
Washington and Lee, there would
almost undoubtedly develop a rival-
ry between the two schools.

In short, it seems ridiculous that
W&L remain in the CAC when it
would be far more advantageous to
be a member of the Mason-Dixon

ed in hearing what the general stu-
'dent consensus is on this question.

promote and encourage the Christian

“People, especially children, look
up to athletes. It’s a case of hero

who is witnessing for the Christian

About two dozen Washington and
Lee students take an active part in
the group. Non-athletes are not ex-
cluded. In fact, they are encouraged
to join.

The Generals’ football coach, Lee
McLaughlin, and basketball coach,
Verne Canfield, serve as advisers.

Locally, the group makes periodic
visits to the Lynchburg Children’s
Home and members keep up “Big
Brother” correspondence with the
children. The group participates in a
program of regular physical therapy
for a mentally retarded Lexington
child in hopes he will someday learn
to crawl and walk properly and to
talk.

Crenshaw attended the FCA con-

which appeared to be one of the
trouble spots earlier, has become

one of the strongest positions with
Butch West, a midfielder last year,
competing with freshman Dave
Johnson, a former lacrosse attack-
man at Gilman, Dick Daesener, and
Frank Morgan for the starting role.
All have shown signs of future
| promise in early practice.

 

The first mid-field is probably the
the finest here in many years. Bob
Frost, who played with Coach Swan
in the Philadelphia lacrosse league
last summer, will take over at cen-
ter mid-field

 

for last year’s All-
American John McDaniels and
could lead the team in_ scoring.

Jay Bowersox returns to his posi-
tion with the strongest lefthanded
shot on the team. Tri-captain Pat
Robertson has been outstanding in
early scrimmages and could have a
great individual season. The second
midfield is composed of returnee
Jackson, Bob Ostroff, and Billy An-
drews, who played on the same team
with Coach Swan and Frost last
summer.

Jackson's return will certainly add
another reliable stick and strong
shot to the offense. Ostroff and An-
drews are both dependable stick-
handlers, who will take advantage of
given opportunities to score. The
third and fourth mid-fields are
weaker, but they have been working
hard in hopes of learning each;

Tuesday Sports Writer
With the varsity lacrosse season opener next week, the
team has been practicing hard for the past two weeks in antici-
pation of its first games with Ohio State and Hofstra. Coach
Dana Swan has been encouraged by the team’s spirit and effort
and hopes for a successful season.

week when it was learned that
Jock Hopkins, outstanding player
on the JV last year, would be lost
for the season due to an internal
leg injury.

The Generals boast a strong start-
ing defense but it lacks depth. Ben
Gambill’s “big stick” will block many
opponents’ shots on the crease this
year, while Warren Stewart and
Lance Bendann, an All-Conference
player as a freshman last year, give

W&L two of the best defensive
stickhandlers in ‘the South. Bob
Hankey, Will Sledge, and Roger
Milam form the second defense and
have worked well together as a
unit.

Tri-captains Carroll Klingelhoffer
and Mike Michaels give the Generals
a potent pair of attackmen; both are
great stickhandlers with hard shots.
Their feeds should account for many
W&L goals this season. Duncan, La-
manote and Tom Pittman, a high
school standout from Moorestown,
New Jersey, are competing with
Reed Paynter for crease attack, Chip
Chew has been impressive in early
drills. George Stamas, Bill Jeffress,
and Paul Murphy are up from the
“B” squad to provide depth for at-
tack.

Swarthmore invades the South for
a scrimmage with the Generals next
Monday and Tuesday. A tough
Ohio State team opens the W&L sea-

;son next Thursday, and the stick-

men finish this term with a game
against Hofstra in Baltimore on
March 27.

EC Adopts Political Reforms

weeks ago, praised the final product
of the E.C, and stated his opinion
that “the plan will work if it gets
a chance.”

The proposed amendment was
passed without a dissenting vote
after its passage was moved by stu-
dent body vice president Jim De
Young. The five basic points of the
plan are:

1, All political parties must reg-

ister with the E.C,

2. All registered political parties
must have nominating conventions
announced at least one week be-

3. Each party must submit an
itemized list of expenditures to the
E.C,

4. The E.C, strongly discourages
unregistered parties or action
groups.

5. Law students and independent
students may register with the
party of their choice.

Gilliam Award

The E.C. also appointed a commit-
tee to screen applicants for the Gil-
liam Award. The committee will be
chaired by Jere Turner and will re-
ceive letters of application up to
April 5.

Letters of application may be sent

To the Editor:

My particular case has nothing at
all to do with the real issue here,
which the administration seems to
overlook. The widening protest that
the campus is now experiencing was
triggered by a single student who
thought it unfair that I should get
an “F” for a mere overcut.

It is true that he was concerned
about my individual case, and he
wrote in protest of this decision; but
as soon as he began to get other
students to sign his letter of pro-

Leyburn Praises
English Opera
As Fine Satire

(Continued from page 2)
every boy and every gal that’s born
into the world alive is either a little
Liberal or else a little Conserva-
tive’? One must admire Lord
Countararat (who traces his ancestry
back to the Flood) as he justifies the
House of Lords by pointing out that
throughout the Napoleonic wars it
“did nothing in particular, and did
it very well.”

Every time the Lord Chancellor
appears there is a big scene. Lex-
ington’s large population of law-
vers will relish his assurance that
“the law is the true embodiment of
everything that’s excellent,” and his
requirement that Strephon back up
his elaims by producing affidavit
from a thunder-storm.

No patter-song in the whole Gil-
bert and Sullivan repertoire is more
inventive than the Lord Chancellor's
account of his nightmare, induced by
love unrequited. It is a dream in
which bieyeles, relatives (a ravenous
horde!), black silk socks, cranber-
ries, and joint-stock companies be-
come madly confused.

To have named these high mom-
ents is not to suggest that Phyllis,
the Fairy Queen, Lord Tolloller, and
the Chorus of Fairies do not beguile
us at their every appearance. The
simple truth is that there is not a
dull moment in the whole opera.

Sullivan’s music glows and spark-
les. A gay fugue announces every
appearance of the Lord Chancellor
Intricate counterpoint is tossed off
like child's play. We hear the
flageolet (or reasonable facsimile
thereof) as well as the trumpet’s
bray.

With the appearance of the Fairies

the music goes “tripping hither,
tripping thither, nobody knows
whither”; but the Peers require a

full orchestra with brasses banging
“Tzing! Boom!”

Altogether it is an_ irresistible
opera—words and music, principals
and chorus, peers and peris, Gilbert
and Sullivan.

Delacardos Are Banned
From Campus by IFC

By DAVE MARCHSE

Last night the IFC held its usual
weekly meeting. The meeting was
short as far as business goes. It
must be the mid-semester doldrums.

The first business was a proposal
by the Phi Gam Representative to
ban the Delacardoes Combo from the
Washington and Lee campus. It was
explained that although this particu-
lar combo was one of the most pop-
ular to play on our campus, that
they were frequent entertainers at
Phi Gam house, their services could
not be retained unless they returned
the articles which they took over
Fancy Dress weekend. As a result
the IFC voted unanimously in sup-
port of the motion.

The IFC then discussed the possi-
bility of having the Self-Study Sub-
committee on Fraternities attend the
IFC-Faculty Coffee with the hope
that they would bring forth questions
and suggestions about the fraternity
situation at Washington and Lee.
The Coffee has ben scheduled for
Thursday, April 8.

The Faculty Committee on Fra-
ternities as well as the fraternity
representatives will also attend. It
is hoped that the faculty and stu-
dents will be abel to arrive at a
common meeting ground in their dis-
cussion of fraternity-campus rela-
tions.

 

Carrell Report Preamble

Shows Purpose Of Reforms
The following proposal is put

forth in recognition of the fact
that a low level of student par-
ticipation in the affairs of student
government now exists. We find
this to be an unhealthy situation
in that our student government
represents those factors of life at
Washington and Lee, such as the
Honor System and conventional
dress, which draw their value from
the breadth of their support, This
proposal should be construed as a
sincere effort to strengthen our
student government and thereby
the values for which it stands by
broadening the present base of
representation. Futhermore, this
proposal should be interpreted as
an affirmation of the electoral pro-
cedure outlined in the present stu-
dent body constitution and as an
encouragement for the develop-
ment of democratically based po-
litical organization at W&L.

shifted from my own situation to
something much larger and more im-
portant.

At present some four to five hun-
dred students have signed the let-
ter—among whom are a large num-
ber of upperclassmen and campus
leaders. The majority of these people
do not know me and are hardly
concerned about by getting an “F”;
their signatures are there not to per-
suade the Absence Cominittee to re-
consider their decision but to express
strong dissatisfaction with the pres-
ent cut system itself,

lt is for this reason that you can-
not afford to discount the import-
ance of the letter and feel that you
have taken care of the problem by

 

deserved the “F”. The ruling was
not necessarily unfair, but the sys-
tem undeniably is.

or “Save John Jay” or “Steve Kes-
ter Denman,” all of whom know
first-hand the harsh penalty that
the present system holds, or it might
even read “Save Jim Kulp” and the
host of other students who have not
yet had the misfortune of overcut-
ting.

There is so much feeling, an ever-
increasing amount, among the stu-
dents and a great many faculty
members about the present system
that it seems almost certain some re-
vision wlil soon have to be made.
It does not seem likely that the sys-
tem will be done away with entire-
ly, for the faculty once tried un-
limited cuts with second semester
seniors (under the assumption that
these students were the most ma-
ture) and it resulted in too many
lowered averages to suit the faculty.

But a change in penalty is not
enough; as long as the cut sys-
tem exists in any form it will con-
tinue to be unrealistic, paternal-
istic and unreasonable. Any such
set of regulations is necessarily
based on the assumption that the
majority of students here are not
responsible enough to decide for
themselves whether or not they
should attend class and thus must
have regulations compelling them
to attend.

This may or may not be true. If
it is true then Washington and Lee
needs to do something about the
caliber of men that it is attracting,
or at least do something toward in-
creasing the responsibility of the
students here. You do not make a
person more responsible by taking
responsibility from him, and there
is surely no adequate justification for
taking this particular responsibility

sult if a leader would place himself
at the head of the people instead of
the party for unification,

Mr. Ives quoted Adam Smith in
emphasizing the importance of a
“laissez-faire” policy in government
in which the individual has a re-
spensibility in industry. He also
stressed Edmund Burke's concept of
the poltical party as a check on the
“king’s” authority.

Under the concept of “New Feud-
alism” Mr. lives indicated the emerg-
ing significance of property and par-
ty as two aspects of a curb on the
economic and political power of the
government: “no man will be absurd
enough to deny the necessity of

E

 

 

such checks and balances.”

During the panel discussion which|
followed his talk, Mr. Ives pointed
to the advantages of maintaining a
two party system; he was disturbed |
by the possibility of having just one
party emerge in control of the na-|
tional government. Along with the|
decline of property rights comes
the “return” to the original status
of medieval land tenure; manage-
ment must be given a fairly free
rein to prevent the return of the

 

 

 

ty can best be met. He pointed out
that Americans must have “sensiv-
ity” toward other countries.

Americans must be aware of what
is going on in other societies and
cultures. Miller demonstrated how,
as a result of America’s increasing
affluence, a feeling of resentment to-
ward the poor countries of the
world has arisen. “It is the role of
the American statesman to reverse
this trend,” Col. Miller stated.

Col. Miller held that mankind has
a definite destiny, and our “rendez-
vous with destiny’ can come if
America, as a representative of free-
dom under law based on representa-
tive government, fulfills its role. “All
paths lead together,” stated Col.
Miller. “We can’t graft our ways on
other societies; rather, we must help
those societies to stability by plant-
ing seeds of freedom.”

Pinney, Hughes Describe Quality of

By EDWARD L, PINNEY
and
DELOS D. HUGHES

Washington and Lee University is
surely one of the most self-applaud-
ed educational institutions in our
society. As is often true of self-
esteem, a certain lack of self-confi-
dence, uneasiness, and anxiety about
the truth is the basis of ours. While
by any fair standard it is likely
that our college is potentially as ex-
cellent as any but a few and poten-
tially more excellent than most, the
extent to which we have realized
this potential is sadly, even tragic-
ally slight.

The numbers of our graduates who
are bank presidents, presidents of
the the American Bar Association
or successful doctors may be im-
pressively large, the average salaries
of our graduates impressively high,
the reputation of the Washington and
Lee gentleman legend; but these are
poor indices of our success when
our contributions to the cultural,
intellectual, and humanitarian as-
pects of life are so meager. Our
graduates do well for themselves but
little for others.

This is one indication—other,
more immediate ones are current
topics of campus conversation—of
the quality of Washington and Lee
life. The quality can best be describ-
ed as generally deficient. This is an
appropriate time and place to ex-
amine the nature of this deficiency,
to outline what our community might
be, and to suggest how we might
improve the quality of our life at
Washington and Lee to reach this
goal.

I

If there is any phase which one
would not apply to Washington and
Lee it is “intellectual excitement.”
In our community instances of this
description are occasions for sur-
prise rather than normal expecta-
tions. Even though the process of
education is an almost complete
mystery, even to those involved in
it we can easily recognize that an
atmosphere of intellectual excite-

ment is the condition in which this
process most often sucessfully takes
place. But there is no intellectual
excitement in our life—little excite-
ment of any sort. It is neither af-
forded by most professors, nor de-
manded by most students. And the
responsibility is charged to both par-
ties. Each at times is guilty of
thwarting the other. Under almost
no circumstances can any excite-
ment be kindled over the number
of seats in the House of Represen-
tatives or the identity of Louis XIV’s
gardner. But neither can excitement
be kindled when prestige is accorded
to minimal academic participation.

This characteristic of Washing -

ton and Lee life is general, in

class and out of class. There is no

adventure, no interest beyond a
superficial level. Almost every as-

pect of the life here seems to con-
spire against it. For instance, those
in our community who might find
some stimulation in the cultural
and artistic side of life are frus-
trated. There is an unfortunate
tendency in men’s colleges to put
the creative arts at the bottom of
curricular and extracurricular
priorities. They are somehow, mis-
takenly, considered inappropriate
or at least nonessential. The re-
sponsibility of the university com-
munity is not only to satisfy what-
ever interests its members may
have when they join the commun-
ity—a responsibility inadequately
met at best—but to develop such
interests. The arts are a funda-
mental and integral part of a lib-
eral education, which is presum-
ably our purpose,

Lexington should be at least a
small oasis in what Mencken refers
to as the Sahara of the Bozart, but
it is just another stop—perhaps a
barely damp spot—in the cultural
desert. A metropolitan community is
not prerequisite for an adequate cul-
tural and artistie life. It is a matter
for our community to accomplish,
and with minimal resources it can be
done. One must give credit to the

Toward An Improved Political System

In an unprecedented move Monday night, the EC pro-
posed a long overdue change in the W&L political system.

The proposal, if passed, will eliminate the possibility of
allowing one party to put its nominees into office unopposed,
Under the proposed system, there will be an excellent oppor-
tunity for the nine houses not in the University Party to unite,
hold primaries this spring, and theoretically set their three best
candidates in competition with the best candidates of the Uni-

versity Party. Without the new

demonstrated, campus elections and consequently, student
government will lose much of their intrinsic value. The new sys-
tem will generate renewed enthusiasm in, and competition for,
student body offices. Also, it will double the number of students
from which to choose the top officers and allow better men a
substantial chance of being elected.

Under the proposed party system, the nominees for office
will not be elected simply by nine men supposedly represent-
ing their houses as each party's clique meeting, but by party
primaries which will allow the whole student body a chance to
represent their choices of nominees. Thus the field of nomi-
nees as well as the electorate itself will attain a broader base.

The stability of the campus political structure, if not the
parties themselves, is an additional advantage of the proposed
system. It would seem imperative that the nine unafhliated
houses unite in order to give themselves and the W&L political
and student government systems a chance.

The referendum on the proposal will be held Wednesday
from 8:15 to 5:00, If the proposal is to pass, a majority of
the student body must vote for it. Thus, it is vital that all stu-
dents vote in the referendum if we are to receive the advant-
ages of a revised political system.

 

Sincere Appreciation

Dean Lewis John, Director of Scholarships and Financial
Aid, has called the Robert E. Lee Scholarship Program, estab-
lished by an anonymous donation of $250,000 to the Univer-
sity in 1955, as “one of the most significant developments at

:

WeL during the past decade.’

The program has made a significant contribution to WeL,
not only for the service provided the Lee Scholars, but also

for the students, faculty, and

sonally and has often been a determining factor in the stu-
dents’ decision to attend W&L.

Art for contributing the one bright
spot in this picture. But music, dra-
ma, creative writing are orphans. The
outlets are minimal, interest more
narrow ithan it should be, the enter-
prises generally ignore or at least
hardly more than perfunctorily en-
couraged. Support for the cultural
and artistic events available in Lex-
ington is hardly overwhelming, nor
is the quality of those events uni-
formly high. Again the responsibili-
ties are mutual ones. All segments
of the community contribute to the
inadequacy, and it will take all of
them to correct it.

The state of culture and the arts
in our life at Washington and Lee
is only a small part of the evidence
that the quality is inadequate, that
there is no excitement. But this
cannot be a comprehensive cata-
logue of all the deficiencies which
contribute to the inadequacy—for
we should have to note then the
incredible absence of anything in
our community approximating an
adequate bookstore, a peculiar
view that the function of a library
is curatorial rather than service
to the community upon which its
academic work largely rests, and
many other curious features of our
situation.

Dr. Edward L, Pinney

But one needs to consider in any
such discussion as this the matter
of the fraternity because it is a large
and important part of the Washing-
ton and Lee life. There is probably
no one associated with the Univer-
sity who seriously maintains that
fraternities are all that they might
reasonably be expected to be, and
no one who is completely satisfied
with the present fraternity situation.
With regard to the criterion of in-
tellectual excitement, few of us
would seriously maintain that fra-
ternities contribute a great deal to it,
notwithstanding the Contact pro-
gram just concluded. It seems clear
that they could and desirable that
they should, but to criticize that they
do not is to mistake a symptom of
our difficulty for its cause. Frater-
nity men—who are rather inclined
to overdefensiveness in the face of
even friendly criticism—are likely to
take the view that their responsi-
bilities are other than academic and
intellectual, that it is sufficient that
the fraternities do not detract from
the academic and intellectual goals
of the community, nor from the in-
tellectual excitement which hope-
fully it generates

This is a quite reasonable posi-
tien, even though we would en-
courage a more positive rele for
the fraternity in contributing to the
intellectual goals of our life. But
is it true that the Washington and
Lee fraternity does not detract
from the academic and intellectual
purposes which are the commun-
ity’s raison d'etre? The view that
fraternities are detrimental in this
respect is based on an acceptance
of the fraternities’ own inflated
myth of their effectiveness. In only
rare cases, or in only superficial
matters, does a fraternity mold a
man significantly in such situations
as ours, It is probably unfair and
certainly futile to charge a frater-
nity with responsibility for the
academic, aleoholic, or urinary sins
of its members.

Within the more formal frame-
work of our life at Washington and
Lee, the absence of excitement, the
quality of the life, is also disap-
pointing. One notices an unhealthy
attachment to what is a perversion
of traditionalism, Tradition should
not mean stasis, But our profes-
sors are not bold, nor are our stu-
dents. The major evidence of in-
novative thinking forwarded by our
administration recently has been
met either with indifference or de-
fensiveness rather than in the
constructive spirit it was intended.
Our self study may yet help us out
of this rut, but a great many vest-
ed interests are at stake and the
results can all too easily be worth-
less.

Variety and experimentation would
seem to be good guides for us in our
curricular arrangements. If ortho-
dox teaching methods, course offer-
ings, format of hours, grading, ex-
aminations, and degree requirements
« rd no excitement, then we had
better be unorthodox. When it is
vital to be spirited in approach to
these matters, we have been listless
and slavish. Why not a course with
no final examination? Why not a
course which meets for three one-
hour lectures one week and one
three-hour seminar the next, or not
at all the next if the instructor thinks
this valuable? Why not consider ar-
ranging our curriculum to concen-
trate elementary courses in 6 or
8 week blocks? We have not ser-
iously considered open and perhaps
desirable alternatives. We have pre-
cluded introducing excitement into
our community by an inclination for
uniformity where variety and ex-
perimentation are in order.

Another important aspect of life
here is indicative of its quality, We
are committed at Washington and
Lee to the in loco parentis con-
cept. What this in fact means in
most cases is that the University
is asked to exercise certain respon-
sibilities which parents never did;
for if they had, the University
would not need to. The in loco
parentis commitment cannot be
meaningfully and creatively imple-
mented by the means available to
a university, A parent’s responsi-
bility is to provide for his son a
foundation for assuming the moral
and social responsibilities of man-
hood and an inclination to do so.
Restraint upon one’s freedom on
the eve of his maturity is a poor
preparation for making responsible
decisions when faced with free
choices.

The University imposes class at-
tendance on the student. He typi-
cally interprets the device as a pro-
tection for the egos of faculty mem-
bers who would otherwise lecture to
near empty classrooms. It is the
sort of truth which hurts. There may
indeed be sound reasons for re-
quiring attendance under certain
conditions, but there seem to us no
valid reasons for requiring it as a
general rule. The reasons which are
ordinarily advanced for a rigid un-
iform cut policy—for instance, that
to allow the professor discretion in
the latter fosters a popularity con-
test among the faculty—represent an
unwarranted denigration of the stu-
dents’ perceptiveness, or an over-
emphasis on faculty sensibilities or
both.

To the extent that our resistance
to a four or five day week is based
on the University’s standing in loco
parentis, again the justification is
unsatisfactory, The abuses which
would accompany an extended

weekend are manifestations of
other more basic problems, just
as with certain deficiencies of fra-
ternities. Free time does not cause
abuses, nor does restriction really
deal with the source of such abuse.
The opportunities provided to all
members of our community by this
innovation—primarily the oppor-
tunity for independent pursuit of
interests contributing to one’s in-
tellectual, moral, and even social
growth, both in and out of Lex-
ington—are incalculably valuable.

Again, the in loco parentis prob-
lem is the mutual responsibility of
all segments of our community. If
the attitude of the administration
and faculty has not been enlighten-
ed, they have certainly been present-
ed with little evidence from stu-
dents to justify changing it. If
Washington and Lee is_ in certain
respects in the prep school category,
this position can be convincingly de-
fended as necessary to protect both
the University and tthe students.
Protection, however, is not an ap-
propriate part of education.

The description of Washington
and Lee life above is, we believe,
a reasonable, although partial, view
of our situation. Most of the brighter
aspects have been ignored. They
certainly exist and should be ap-
plauded, but not applauded so vig-
orously that we lose sight of our
failings. What our life might be is not
nearly so easy to specify, but it
seems ito us encompassed by two
interrelated ideas especially. We
should be intellectually curious, in-
tensely rather than casually so,
and we should be a true community.

The purpose of formal education
are not exhausted by the transfer
of a certain amount of information
from mind to mind, This is an im-
portant part of it, but by no means
the most important. The essential

Dr. Delos D. Hughes

task is to develop intellectual curi-
osity, a desire to learn and know.
Probably we cannot hepe to create
this curiosity but only to develop
it where it exists, Intellectual curi-
osity means that the important
questions are Why? and How?
rather than What? and When?
The intellectually curious man is
not a man without facts—on which
we tend to put far too much em-
phasis in any case—but a man who
is not force-fed facts under the
pretense that he is being educated.
Ile is a man driven to seek the
facts necessary to deal with the
problems he poses for himself,
Nor is he a narrow man, as we are
likely to think of intellectuals, but

 

As Others See Us

rather the broadest of men with
an interested and ordinarily some
competence in almost anything

brought to his attention,

It is sometimes assumed that part
of the university’s function is to
inculcate certain values in its mem-
bers. But the indoctrination of men
with particular values—whether of
gentlemanly manner or conventional
dress or even intellectual curiosity—
is not really the proper business of
this or any university. If the values
the community has __ traditionally
cherished are sound, in a communi-
ty characterized by a spirit of in-
tellectual curiosity those values will
be sustained as new members enter
and are invited to examine them.

The ideal of a true community is
no easier to communicate. A_ basic
implication is that divisions within
the group are minimzed. The Wash-
ington and Lee experience should
be a situation of learning together
rather than a situation of teaching
on the one hand and learning on the
other. This ideal is not easy to un-
derstand or to accept, much less to
accomplish. Teachers often think
there is nothing to learn from stu-
dents, students that they have noth-
ing to offer to the teacher. These
opinions reflect only an inadequate
view of what we are all here to-
gether for. If the teacher is only a
more colorful, handier, more inter-
esting, mobile textbook, then he is
highly overpaid and much too es-
teemed. His value is always as a
catalyst, only occasionally as a ref-
erence, Having passed along some
paths which all the intellectually cu-
rious must retrace, he can assist in
making the trip more interesting and
prevent some wastes of effort But
finally the “student” and the “teach-
er’ must learn together if either
is to gain anything more than his
degree or his paycheck. They must
coniribute to the growth of each
other in almost a literal way.

If this communality is eur goal,
then certain perceived impediments
to the community's fulfillment
must be removed. Professors must
be approachable, students not in-
hibited. The major obstacle is not
that there is no respect for or
interest in one group by the other,
but rather that too often neither is
especially interested in learning
anything new. When both groups
are truly committed to learning,
both intellectually curious, then
the problems of rapport will be
few and easily solved.

A final the view of
what Washington and Lee might be
like. What of the non-academic and
non-intellectual, ie., of the social?
Probably for the student (and the
unmarried faculty member) the so-
cial situation in Lexington will never
be ideal. But given the limitations
inherent in our situaton, we need
not make the social any less satisfac-
tory by divorcing it from the rest of
the community's life. The social is
complementary to the purposes of
the community, not contradictory.
The integration of the community in
this respect may be less ‘
plete because of substantial differ-
ences of responsibilities, and
social preferences; but in com-
munity where intellectual interests
are similar a great deal of reward-
ing social integration can take place.
If by social life we continue to mean
the independent enjoyment of cer-
tain pleasures at the same time and
in the same places where others are,
or of pleasures for which others
ire acquired as props, then our social
life will continue to be unsatisfac-

W&L Wins 2 Events:

BY JOHN

Trackmen;

GRAHAM

The Spiders of the University of Richmond wove their
web around the Washington and Lee track team as the Gen-
erals dropped their spring track debut 97-44.

Outmanned by the Richmonders, the Generals managed
only two first places in 17 events. Twelve second places, how-
ever, kept the Generals within respectable distance of the

Southern Conference School.

High hurdler Mike Goode turned in
a top-notch performance, winning the
120-yard high hurdles in :17.3. The
other W&L win came in the javelin as
Tommy Sparks hurled it 157 feet for
first place. Ric Mynttinen, the Gener-
als’ top man in that event, pulled a
muscle before the meet, and came in
fourth.

Big points for the Spiders came in
the two relays, which they won, and
in their sweep of the 100-yard dash,
a feat that they had duplicated in the
state indoor meet at VMI.

The Generals held their own best
in the field events, scoring 27 of their
44 points. The Spiders scored 36 points
in the field events as compared with
their 61 in the runnnig events.

Luke Meadors and John Graham
led the way in the field events, scoring
two seconds apiece. Meadors, a fresh-
man, scored seconds in the broad
jump and in the triple jump. Graham
placed second in the high jump and
in the pole vault, Freshman Mark
Kelso placed second in the shot put
as did Ted Larson in the discus.

In the running events, besides
Goode’s win, Andy Kilpatrick placed
second in the mile, and also in the
two-mile, Jim Thompson took sec-
ond in the 880, and freshman Bob
Miller was second in the 330-yard in-
termediate hurdles.

The Generals have a Friday date
with Old Dominion College in Nor-
folk before Spring vacation.

‘Spring Sports Start
Action Next Week

The 1965 Washington and Lee
full start next week with only the golf
and freshman tennis squads not seeing

any action.

The baseball team gets the week
underway a little early with a scrim-
mage at 2:30 tomorrow afternoon
agains VMI at their field. Coach Joe
Lyles says either Pete Heumann or
Bill Rasmussen will start, with Heu-
mann more likely. No pitcher will
go more than two or three innings.

Then on Friday the Generals have
another scrimmage, this one against
New Haven College here at 3:15.
Coach Lyles emphasized that both
games will be just practice games
aimed at checking the team’s potential.
He added, “Ill be just a spectator
looking the team over.”

Next to open the season will be
the lacrosse squad on Tuesday after-
noon. They will face Swarthmore in
a scrimmage here at 3:15. Then on
Thursday afternoon, the W&L la-

lar game against Ohio State here at
3:15. Coach Dana Swan will be start-
ing his first season as head lacrosse
coach.

The freshman lacrosse team also
opens the season next week. They'll
go against Episcopal High School on
Friday afternoon there.

Phi Kaps Win IM Track Title;
Win Bowling, Ping Pong Also

By JOHN BEAGLE

Phi Kappa Sigma won this year’s
Intramural Track Meet nosing out
Sigma Phi Epsilon in the last two
events.

Phi Kap had 84 meet points while
SPE had 66 to pick up second. SAE
was third with 49. This is the second
straight year Phi Kap has won the
meet.

Meadors Wins Two

One of the top individual perform-
ances of the meet was turned in by
Luke Meadors of SPE with two firsts
and a second. Meadors won the broad
jump, took second in the triple jump,
and helped his team gain a first place
in the 440 yard relay.

John Wiley of Phi Gam was also a
double winner as he took the 440 and
220 yard dashes. Bob Miller of SPE
also had two firsts and a second in
winning the 120 yard high hurdles,
the 440 yard relay, and gaining a close
second in the 330 yard intermediate
hurdles. Miller most likely would
have been the meet’s only triple win-
ner had he not been slowed up by
some stray dogs in the intermediate
hurdles.

Morrison Upsets Meadors

Morrison of Sigma Nu kept Meadors
from being a triple winner as he up-
set the SPE freshman in the triple
jump.

Other meet winners included Lar-
son of Phi Psi in the discus, Goode
of Phi Psi in the intermediate hurdles,
Kelso of Sigma Chi in the shot, Bru-
ton of Lambda Chi in the mile, Skin-
ner of Delt in the javelin, Murfin of
Sigma Nu in the 880 and Griffin of
SAE in the high jump.

This year’s meet saw 16 teams
entered with a total of 137 partici-
pants. The two days for the meet were
both excellent weather-wise. The only
snag in an otherwise well-rounded
meet was a protest in two parts which
was disallowed in a meeting of the in-
tramural board on Tuesday afternoon.

Phi Kap’s Win Ping Pong

On Monday night Phi Kap won its.
first of three straight intramural |
charmpionships by wnining ping pong. |

 

After Phi Kap defeated ZBT, 5-0, on |

Thursday night, Phi Delt and Sigma |
Nu both forfeited rather than play
the Phi Kap powerhouse. ZBT came
in second, Sigma Nu third, and Phi |
Delt fourth.

Phi Kap’s line up was so strong and
full of depth that it swept through
seven straight matches winning all by
a 5-0 score. In the last four years only
the Delt softball teams, the Phi Gam
volleyball teams, and the SAE basket-
ball teams shared as much domination
over the competition as this year’s Phi
Kap ping pong team.

This was the second year in a row
that Phi Kap won the crown. Phi Kap
was led by Doug Bielenberg who has
never lost a game of ping pong in two
years. The other three singles play-
ers were Kiah Ford, Meade Cadot,
and Forrest Dickinson. The doubles
team was Pete Johnson and Tom Cox.

Phi Kaps Win Bowling Too

In bowling on Tuesday night Phi |

Kap won its third crown in two days

by defeating ZBT in bowling 4-0.

Phi Kap had games of 818-893-820 for

a total of 2531 to ZBT’s 723-767-763
total of 2253.

tory, for it is not really social at
all. But if it really means, as it
should, our enjoyment of these
pleasures with others, our sharing
them and communicating them, then
it is simply another way of learning
in a different context.

iil

The problems identified above
can be solved and the ideal pro-
posed can be effected, Basically
two reorientations are required,
both of which are feasible and
probably essential if we wish to
improve the quality of Washing-
ton and Lee life. In the first place
we must attract to our community
those who will take advantage of
the opportunity it affords, The stu-
dents at Washington and Lee who
lack above-average intellectual
capaticies are few, although they
perhaps outnumber those possess-
ing vigorous, above-average intel-
lectual appetites. There are prob-
ably few professor who have
little to offer us, but a much larger
number who do in fact offer us
little. Though the specific sugges-
tions which follow relate mostly
to the student body, some are ap-
propriate for the faculty as well,
acknowledging that there are fac-
tors in the professorial market
which the University cannot con-
trol.

The absence of intellectual excite-
ment at Washington and Lee is due
partly to the uniformity—of back-
ground, opinions, interests, expecta-
tions—among its members. If it is
indeed only coincidence that the
faculty with truly rare exceptions is
Protestant of Anglo-Saxon extrac-

tion, it is certainly no coincidence
that the student body in spite of a
more diverse religio-ethnic back-

ground is predominantly from a un-
iform socio-economic environment.
It is stated policy of this university
that a way will be found for any
qualified student who wishes to at-
tend to pursue an education here.
This is without doubt a sincere and
determined policy. But the fact re-
mains that Washington and Lee at-
tracts mainly certain types of men

and has not cultivated the interest of
other types. The resulting uniformi-|
ty is dulling. The confirmation of
one’s opinions by those around him
it not educational. The challenge
of opposing points of view may be.
The challenges one meets here today
are largely superficial. The Univer-
sity must act to introduce diversity
into its membership of drastically
reorienting the admissions program
to attract a broader variety of stu-
dents. The argument that we are en-
titled to select associates we happen
to prefer is not at all relevant here.
The question is not to what a man is
entitled, but what conditions are
most favorable for learning, for
building and sustaining curiosity.

It is probably true that within
the goals set for them, those pri-
marily involved in the admissions
process do their job well, But we
have set the wrong goals, We must
do more than identify and select
the capable, alert, and polished;
we must identify and select the
willing, interested, and curious.
The proud annual recitation of our
rising college board scores is not
reflected in a comparable rise in
level of academic interest. The dif-
ference here could mean that we
are over-attentive to superficial or
misleading indicators of probable
future performance.

If it takes time, effort, and money
to detect those who, regardless of
scores and standings, will actively
seek an education at Washington and
Lee rather than just a degree, these
are resources well spent. It seems
reasonable that the faculty should)
be pressed into service in identifying

 

these men

from faculty ranks to assist the}
Dean of Admissions
term—for they are particularly

qualified by experience to be able
to judge the quality we most need.
In any event a life of discriminating
quality at Washington and Lee de-
mands that we seek to exclude those
who are simply expected or other-
wise obligated to be here, and to
include those who are determined
to contribute a heavy part of their
energies toward the end of becom-
ing educated men.

The low level of academic seri-
ousness is sometimes attributed to
the disinclination of serious stu-
dents to apply to Washington and
Lee in the first place. This is no
doubt true and demands immediate
remedy, But we have been happy
to accept the capable but unmoti-
vated student in licu of the intellec-

ally motivated in the first place.

An enthusiastic student does not
permit any but the most hopeless
instructors to dampen his enthus-
ism. Even if the price is a few
empty desks and dormitory rooms,
we would do well to pay that
price,

In the second place, if we wish to
improve Washington and Lee life we
must raise our academic standards
by banishing forever the confusion
between quality and quantity. To
raise the passing grade level, to re-
quire more facts learned, more
pages read, more problems worked,
is not to raise academic standards
in any meaningful sense, for there is
no qualitative improvement.

In most areas of academic in-
struction, perhaps not all, the
quality can be improved by a
simple reorientation of effort, What
needs to be done is to involve
the student in solving the current
problems of the discipline. It is
nonsense to reply that the student
cannot even understand the prob-
lems, much less solve them. If he
finds these problems interesting
and if he is as capable as we ex-
pect our students to be, he will
try to understand and to solve the
problem, Never mind the flops.
Even if no basic contributions are
made, he has learned something in
the process,

The possibilitties here are perhaps
less easily imagined in fields other
than the natural sciences where the
problems of laser physics or the
DNA molecule may be fairly readily
perceived. But in a basic sense a
social science or humanities profes-

perhaps with a full-time| sor can also share with his students |

ing a different sort of person to our
community and by affording him a
different sort of opportunity here.
This is not all that is necessary to
improve the quality of Washington
and Lee life, but it is a beginning.
If we value our community we
should be willing to exert the effort
required to improve it. In addition
it seems to us that we might be
more tolerant of our critics and
recognize the compliment usually
implied by criticism. Effective criti-
cism most frequently derives from
considerable anger or disappoint-
ment and from considerable affec-
tion. The reader who has struggled
to the end of this overlong presen- |
tation of unsystematic ideas may by
now have concluded that the criti-|
cism is not effective, but its sources |
are the same—anger, disappoint-
ment, affection, and—most import-
antly—optimism.

A message of importance to sophomore men

if you've got what it takes
to be an Army Officer
you may qualify for this new

on-campus training program

A new Army ROTC program starts this

coming Summer for sophomore men who apply
prior to May 1—only 3,000 applicants to be accepted

If you're a sophomore now attending one of the 247 colleges and universities that
offer Army Officer training—or you plan to transfer to one of these schools next
Fall—you may qualify for the new two-year Army ROTC program.

This new program —designed especially for college men who have not taken
Army ROTC during their first two years—will commence with six weeks of
field training this coming Summer, beginning June 14. Then you'll have
on-campus training during your junior year . . . six additional weeks at camp
during the following Summer . . . and more on-campus training during your
senior year. Even flight training is offered at some schools.

ROTC training is really a process of learning to organize and direct others—

to be a leader. Consider how important this ability can be to you throughout life;
yet, to acquire it you will spend relatively little time in the ROTC classroom.
You'll obtain valuable junior management experience . . . a fuller and richer
campus life . . . extra spending money ($40 per month during your junior

and senior school years, and even more during Summer training) . . . and,

when you graduate, an Army Officer's commission as Second Lieutenant.

Then you'll normally spend two interesting years on active duty, often

abroad with opportunities for travel.

Talk to the Professor of Military Science on your campus about this
opportunity. Ask him to describe this new short program in detail.

Or send in the coupon below for complete information. There's no obligation
involved, and you'll not be subjected to any “hard sell” recruiting effort.
The kind of men the Army wants can decide for themselves if this new

opportunity is right for

don't

if you're good enough to be an Army Officer,
settle for less. Sign up now for Army ROTC.

Proposal N seul
Majority Vote |
For _ Adoption |

Nomination Processes |

Would Be Changed

In New Elections |
By WENDALL L. WINN |

As a result of the Executive Com-
mittee’s unanimous endorsement of a
proposed amendment to the student
body constitution which would pro-
vide extensive reform in|
connection with student elections a}
referendum will be held on Wednes-|
day from 8:15 to 5:00 in Washington |
Hall |

Under the new ae which was}
drafted by Rick Carrell after several |
students had expressed the need for|
a revised system, the campus politi-
cal parties would be required to
register with the E.C. and be pledged
to hold open primaries. Many feel
that the proposed system would be
definite improvement over the
present Clique method employed in
nominations, and if the majority of
students get behind this referendum
and vote in favor of the amendment, |
then it will go into effect in time for|
this year’s spring elections.

Carrell and Steve Smith, who
was the first to undertake the in-
itiative of introducing a possible |
plan, feel that the new system |
will meet with success with the
cooperation of the student body. |
They added that this amendment |
would contribute te the overall
stability of our political system |
and is a “positive plan of action.” |

In addition registering with |
the E.C., all political parties would}
be required to have nominating con-|
ventions announced at least a week|
prior to the election; students |
and Independents could register with
the party of their choice. Under the
proposed system, enthusiasm and

during elections would
among the students, permit-|
freer competitive spirit. The
student body would be given
opportunity to express thei:
of candidates instead of the,
nomination being dominated by one
party Clique

A majority of the students,
however, when asked their opin-
ions were not familiar with the
proposed amendment or the ap-
proaching referendum: this may
have a detrimental effeet upon the
voting Wednesday: in order for
this referendum te pass, it is neces-
sary for a majority of the Student
Body to vote affirmatively.

Mary Wells

Miss Wells, a resident of Detroit,

when her first hit, “Bye Bye Baby”
received prominence as a a hit.

Since that time, Miss Wells has
remained with the Motown group—
the same company also features Mar-

vin Gaye, the Supremes, the Im-
pressions, the Contours and many
other popular recording groups

and has recorded a bevy of national
hits such as “The One Who Really
Loves You,” “You Beat Me to the
Punch,” and her latest hit “Never
Never Leave Me.”
Dionne Warwick

“Don’t Make Me Over” and “Walk
on By” are two of Miss Warwick's
greatest hits. This blues singer began
her career with the recording of
“Anyone Who Had a Heart” and has
been international every since, hav-

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che King-tum Phi

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association
Tuesday Edition

 

Tomorrow’s Referendum

For the past three weeks the Ring-tum Phi has expressed
concern for the political climate of this University. Even more
important that this we have presented a Fair Election Plan
which has received the endorsement of the Executive Commit-
tee. Tomorrow the proposal will be presented to the student
body for final ratification. Once again we wish to urge the adop-
tion of this innovation primarily because we feel the welfare of
student government hangs in the balance.

The new proposal is certainly not without its difficulties and

so-called impracticabilities, and yet we believe that the main-|")

tenance of superior student government demands a healthy po-

litical order. The existing system threatens the traditions of our |)
University not only because it contributes to a lack of student!)

support, but because it promotes apathy toward the quality
of student leadership.

To those who would say the clique system is the guardian
of responsible leadership, we would point out that the wisdom
and maturity of this student body is quite capable of selecting
its own representatives. The elitist theory of politics which has
so often been championed by adherents of the status quo dem-
onstrates a fundamental distrust of the ability of students to
exercise intelligent political choice. Admittedly, there have
been cases in which student elections degenerated into a ridicu-
lous sham, but this was due in part, we believe, to the isolation
of the vast majority of students from any real voice in the selec-
tion of candidates.

At the time this Fair Election Plan was presented to the
Executive Committee every effort was made to encourage those
who opposed the change to justify the present system or to
introduce some alternative plan. It is particularly significant
that when the EC met to consider the proposal not one spokes-
man for its opposition took the time or interest to present their
views before the open hearing. This fact alone illustrates the
difficulty in formulating a creditable defense of a corrupt sys-
tem.

The recent referendum on conventional dress conducted
by the Assimilation Committee was singularly unsuccessful
in stimulating a large turn-out at the polls. If such be the case
in tomorrow’s referendum, the possibility of meaningful reform
will slip away. A failure to elicit any response from a high per-
centage of students will simply underscore the deterioration of

political responsibility on this campus. The evil which this new |i
proposal is trying to eliminate may well be the force which de- |,

feats it.

Tomorrow's referendum offers to the student body an op-|#

portunity to broaden the base of campus politics, and at the
same time maintain the essential high calibre of leadership. Cer-
tainly the possible rewards of this change demand that we give
it every consideration. The price of clique-dominated politics
may well be the extinction of responsible student leadership
which i nturn undermines the institutions and indeed, the her-
itage of this University.

CONTACT: A Limited Experience

In light of the recent evaluation of CONTACT given the
IFC by Blaine Brownwell, there are several aspects of the pro-
gram which deserve critical attention. The enormous amount of
time and effort which the Steering Committee devoted to the
planning and presentation of CONTACT deserves the applause
of the entire university. Yet, the overall impact of the sympo-
sium leaves much to be desired.

The lack of student participation is perhaps the most ob-
vious indication that CONTACT failed to stimulate the inter-
est of a vast majority of students. This is due not so much to
a generally apathetic student body, but rather to the limited
range of topics and speakers on the program. Instead of being
a truly intellectual symposium offering a wide variety of speak-
ers and subjects, the weekend consisted of a series of lectures
centered around the theme of contemporary politics.

The content of the talks often avoided or omitted the con-
troversial and crucial issues of today concentrating on the
‘official line’ characteristic of government spokesmen. As a
result, the panel discussions and questions were some what
superficial, although most any topic would be considered rele-
vant to the “American Experience.”

In all fairness it should be noted that Dr. Silver was an
exception to the preceding comments concerning the topics
and speakers of the CONTACT program. His remarks were
timely and certainly controversial, even though his presenta-
tion could stand improvement. Dr. Silver dealt with an aspect
of the American Experience which has particular relevance for
the University community,

A Tale of Brave Men and Exotic Adventure

 

By ARTHUR McBLAIR CROWLEY
It was almost eight thirty in the
morning. The crowded classroom was
silent: watches re-
peatedly checked,
the professor ner-
vously grinding
out his cigarette,
eyes on the wall
clock, whispering.
Eight thirty: the
door swinging
shut, stopping
with a click. Roll
call. All present
but one. The pro-
fessor slowly ar-
ranged his notes, waiting until the
last possible minute. Then he began
to lecture.

“Gentlemen, last time we were dis-
cussing the Deuteronomic—”

It was impossible to pay attention
Everyone was staring at the empty
seat, asking the same question, get-
ting the same answer: Glen “BoBo”
Orbes was absent.

Had Glen “BoBo” Orbes overslept?
Had Glen “BoBo” Orbes purposely
eut class? Had Glenn “BoBo” Orbes
gone to D.C.? The complex admin-
istrative machinery of Ampersand
swung into operation.

From his office on the second floor
of Arnold Hall, Hugo Rodriguez,
Dean of Students, dispatched a terse
note to assistant Dean Bunny Snipes:

FIND GLEN “BOBO” ORBES

GIVE F,

Two days before and six thousand,
eight hundred miles away, Glen
“BoBo” Orbes, forty six fifths of
three dollar Canadian Club strap-
ped to his sweat-soaked body, wiped
the blade of his machete on his
white ducks and turned to Musinga,
his Bantu guide:

“How much farther, Musanga?”

The native cocked his football head
to one side, then flashed a tooth-
less grin and pointed. “Not far
Bwana. Wahima village.”

“Is there a trave lagency or police
station there?”

“No know,” Musinga muttered.

The village came into view: a
cluster of irregularly spaced thatched
huts. Orbes and Musinga entered the
clearing.

“Welcome to our village.” A tall
man dressed in red and white par-
rot feathers stepped out into the
sunlight from one o fthe larger
huts. “I am Bubanza, king of the
Wahima. Please accept my cordial
invitation to spend a few pleasant
hours before resuming your jour-
ney.”

“Thanks, chief.” Orbes, greatly re-
lieved, began setting his Canadian
Club bottles in the shade. “You
know, you speak pretty good Eng-
lish.”

The chieftain smiled and ran his
hands over the colorful parrot feath-
ers. “N.C. State, '54.”

“Yeah? Orbes, Ampersand U., 68.

 

behind one of the huts emerged two

 

Pretty fat place you got here too.
You wouldn’t have a travel agency
or a police station somewhere around
here would you?”

“Ah. So you like our village. Per-
haps you would care to examine it
more closely?”

“You bet the ranch I would!”

“The ranch?”

“Yeah. Ranch. It all looks like
gravy ‘to me, Say, you wouldn't have
a travel agent...”

“I think you will be especially in-
terested in our educational system.
I believe that yours, in many re-
spects, is patterned on our own.”

“Huh?”

“Come. You will see.”

Bubanza led Orbes to the opposite
end of the village where they came
upon an outdoor classroom, flat rocks
serving as desks, all facing a grassy
hill.

“The Buru, or professor, lectures
from atop that mound. All Buru
who receive Strangaga or tenure, are
buried there according to tribal cus-
tom.”

Suddenly, Bubanza was interrupt-
ed by loud squeals of terror. From

running figures: one, a boy of about
eight years—the other a man, naked
but for a huge devil mask. The
witch-doctor.

In a second, the small boy was
dragged down, a knee placed in the
small of his back, and the witch-
doctor, using a sharp rock, began

By dictionary definition, progress
means an onward course, a jour-
neving forward, gradual betterment,
the progressive development and
evolution of mankind as a process.

Therefore, progress would appear
to be meaningful and desirable. The
urge to better
ourselves, to bet-
ter the past, to
bring about tri-

 

umphs over the
world’s ills — be
they social, eco-

nomic, or politi-
' cal~is a worthy
and important
motivation that
should enlist the
De Young talents of those

best equipped to
cure the troubles that we face today.

Governments which once devoted
their time and energies to doing
things for people they could not
do for themselves, are now immersed
in cradle-to-the-grave security and
provide a crushing form of welfare-
ism which discourages individual in-
centive.

Consider the United States. At
the moment, present and recom-
mended public services call for larg-
er expenditures than we pay for
national defense which now con-
sumes more than half of the federal
budget. Is this progress?

For those of us who are concerned

   

DeYoung Seeks Progress, Not Progression

with individual responsibility, we
wonder how much “progress” we
can stand in terms of the surging
all-powerful federal establishment.

Is it progress to watch our pre-
cious gold reserve dwindle away to
a 26 year low while our government
refuses to take stern measures that
would almost immediately correct
the imbalance of payments?

Is it enough for Washington to
ask businessmen to reduce foreign
lending and expenditures and has
there been any specific proposals
for increasing the price of money
in the American market in order
to keep capital at home?

How do we explain the continu-
ance of foreign aid at levels when
governments abroad now owe the
United States more than $37 billion
in legal debts incurred during the
two world wars and postwar periods?
It is not these very debtor nations
that are now rich with gold piled
high?

How can we progress when our
country has really avoided any self-
imposed monetary disciplines? We
must realize that the American dol-
lar is both a domestic and world
currency. We can not afford to
shun foreign demands for gold in
exchange for U.S. dollar balances.
The acceptability of our currency
in world commerce will disappear.

We have to take in consideration
the effect it will have if we reneg
on our gold guarantee. We can not

 

 

delude ourselves into thinking that
dollars can be used in payment of
our international trade balance.
One of our troubles stems from the
fact that we have been flooding
the free world with dollars in the
last fifteen years, At the moment,
members of the common market
are suggesting further demands
for U.S. gold unless the U.S. quick-
restores its financial house. Even
the most complacent observer
must recognize the very real dan-
ger inherent in the relentless
buildup of foreign dollar claims,
the rising calls on our gold, and
the mounting arrogance of nations |
whose economies and currencies |
have been rebuilt with our dollars.

How can we at the same time
compliment ourselves on our great
prosperity while so many of the
world’s great monetary experts see
trouble ahead for us.

President Johnson as the originator
of the Great Society has called upon
students to ‘work and sacrifice and
even dare’ in the Great Society. He
has said that this is not the genera-
tion for a sheltered and uneventful
life. But as the Wall Street Journal
has said, “At every turn, almost
every day, some fresh proposals for
sheltering the individual, for ruth-
lessly degrading the value of work-
and sacrificing and daring.”

Certainly the President's war on
crime is desirable. But how can it

What makes all this rebellion . . . Necessary?

 

By ROY TYLER
Tuesday Columnist

The call has gone out from dis-
gusted professor and restless fresh-
men that Washington and Lee stu-
dents get off their
apathetic back-

sides and have a

protest riot or
something like
tha.t.

Several proles-

fessors have crit-
icized the student
body for not hav-
ing enough nerve
to question
source of authori-
ty. They do not,
say exactly what “authori-
ty” should be questioned. It is not
the authority of the professors, nor
administrative power

Tradition Questioned
The authority most eritized seems
to be the authority of tradition. Tra-
dition, the erities say, is almost al-
ways unjustified. The only justifiea-
tion for the existence of tradition
has to be that it gives the college

freshman something to protest

| The immediate answer will, of
jcourse, be that it would put an end
jto the growing apathetic frame of

ever so obvious.

But why must the student body,
iwith emphasis naturally on the
freshman have to march
around the campus protesting tra-
dition? Why is it absolutely neces-
sary that the honor system, frater-
nities, and conventional dress be the
objects of protest?

class,

Orthedex protests take the form
of rebellion against tradition, but in
this is found a sort of conformity
within non-conformity. Non-con-
formity, or individual emphasis, can-
not follow any set pattern of be-
| havior.

Non-Conformity

In other words, the beatnik non-
conformist who must look like all
other beatniks ie even less of an
individualist than the ivy leaguer
who follows the style. In this, non-
conformity is conformity

enthusiasm on campus would really
like to see something unusual, why
not a surge of support for tradition?
If something like conventional dress
should be maintained, why must it
be changed to prove we are not be-
ing apathetic?

The current protest against the
honor system is a prime example.
Several rather starry-eyed humani-
tarlans on campus feel that a student
who lies, cheats, or steals is merely
a vietim of unfortunate circum-
stances, They then attempt to enlist
aid by seeusing those who do not
join them of being apathetic.

Not a Dolt

“Cut system?”

“Yes. The child has evidently
missed a class because of negligence
or simple misconduct, and now must
pay the price. As you can see, for
each cut, an ear is severed from the
head, therefore allowing the ordi-

Briggs: French
Film At Lyric
Well Composed

By WARD BRIGGS

Presently at the Lyrie is a Freneh
film, Les Liaisons Dangeureses, star-
ring Jeanne Moreau, Gerard Phil-
ippe, and directed by Roger Vadim,
original screener of that classic And
God Created Woman, which you will
remember won the Anatomy Award
in 1959.

The screenplay is an adaptation of
the novel of the same name written
by an impecunious French artillery
officer named Choderlos Laclos, in
1782. The book—and the film—try to
analyze the psychology of love, or
rather seduction, with what is in
both the literary and film word,
scandalous impunity. At its publi-
cation, of course, it was greeted as
an outrage by the society it beth
criticized and depicted, and con-
comitant with its initial seorn, vili-
fication and denouncement sold out
its entiring printing within two
weeks. It was bought by young men
as a guidebook to more elegant se-
duction and young women read it
behind locked doors. A bound copy,
with the author's name discreetly
erased, was found in the library of
Marie Antoinette.

The novel consists in an exchange
of letters between eight characters,
of whom the two principal are Mar-
quise de Merteuil and Viscount Val-
mont. These two lovers make a pact
between themselves, forbidding jeal-
ousy and allowing complete sexual
freedom. Each is free to take separ-
ate lovers, on the condition that the
pleasures of seduction be never al-

Adams Hits Amendment

To the Editor:

While improvements in the pres-
ent campus political system are
urgently needed, I do not feel that
the proposals which are up for refer-
endum vote will previde a solution
to the problem or even a significant
improvement of the present system

Look at the five points of the pre-
posal. The first requires that each
“party” register, and thus it merely
“legitimizes” the clique system. The
third point, which requires each
party to submit to the EC a list af
expenditures, is & Useless require=-

(a5 there

By TOM CARPENTER

Last week’s column has not drawn
too many comments thus far. One
student said, “It looks dull. I don’t
think T’ll bother reading it.” An-
other warned that the faculty and
administration did not take kindly
to articles attacking their pride and
joy, the CAC. A third agreed with
the column and said that he had
intended to write a letter to the edi-
tor,
now.

Several athletes playing spring
sports have been overheard com-
plaining about the lack of adherence
to training rules that has been dis-
played by some of their teammates
One athlete, who sticks to the regu-
lations set down by his coach, said
the he would not turn anyone into
the coach because he believed that
other violators would be escaping
scot free. Why should one man suf-
fer when others who deserve pun-
ishment do not receive any? He
seemed to accept in a philosophical
manner the fact that training regu-
lations would be broken no matter
what happened.

The baseball team looks like it
will win more games than usual this
year. Coach Lyles has two strong
pitchers in Chris Wigert and Pete
Heumann, a fair catcher in Tom
Crenshaw, and a solid collection of
infielders and outfielders. The in-
field of Ship Chase on first, either
Mike Saunders or Larry Perreault
at second, Dave Kirkpatrick at short,
and Eric Sisler at third. Sisler, who
ineligible last year, was the
leading hitter on the club as a fresh-
man two years ago. The outfield
will consist of Ashley Allen, Gordon
Gay, and Jim Crothers. Allen and
Crothers expected
the team with most of its long ball
hitting, although Wigert led the
team in RBI's two years ago while
playing in only half the games. Lyles
is so enthusiastic over his hitters
that he is reputed to have told his
club that opposing pitchers will have

why require the parties to submit
such a list of expenses? So the EC
can file them away? There is no
valid reason for this pcint. As far as
the fourth and fifth points, the EC
merely “discourages” splinter fact-
ions and “suggests” full campus par-
ticipation. This is nothing new. The

A message of importance to sophomore men

if you've got what it takes
to be an Army Officer
you may qualify for this new

on-campus training program

A new Army ROTC program starts this

coming Summer for sophomore men who apply
prior to May 1—only 3,000 applicants to be accepted

If you're a sophomore now attending one of the 247 colleges and universities that
offer Army Officer training—or you plan to transfer to one of these schools next
Fall—you may qualify for the new two-year Army ROTC program.

This new program—designed especially for college men who have not taken
Army ROTC during their first two years—will commence with six weeks of
field training this coming Summer, beginning June 14. Then you'll have
on-campus training during your junior year . . . six additional weeks at camp
during the following Summer . . . and more on-campus training during your
senior year. Even flight training is offered at some schools.

ROTC training is really a process of learning to organize and direct others—

to be a leader. Consider how important this ability can be to you throughout life;
yet, to acquire it you will spend relatively little time in the ROTC classroom.
You'll obtain valuable junior management experience . . . a fuller and richer
campus life . . . extra spending money ($40 per month during your junior

and senior school years, and even more during Summer training) . . . and,

when you graduate, an Army Officer’s commission as Second Lieutenant.

Then you'll normally spend two interesting years on active duty, often

abroad with opportunities for travel.

Talk to the Professor of Military Science on your campus about this
opportunity. Ask him to describe this new short program in detail.

Or send in the coupon below for complete information. There's no obligation
involved, and you'll not be subjected to any “hard sell” recruiting effort.
The kind of men the Army wants can decide for themselves if this new
opportunity is right for them.

Statement
In summing up his candidacy,
Mindel said:
“I do not believe the Executive

Committee has lived up to its poten-
tial nor fulfilled its responsibility in
taking the lead in student govern-
ment this year, and strongly feel
that something must be done to re-
verse this situation. I find a crisis in
leadership on our campus where
the principle of “active representa-
tion” has been neglected, and my

office is to provide responsible gov-|
ernment which actually, rather than
theoretically represents student con-,|

sencus. I feel I learned a tremen-|
dous amount serving this year on

;the EC, not only in regard to what
| this body did or has done, but also in
| regard to what it did not do or has
not done in the past.

“This experience, coupled with an
energetic drive and a spirit of open-
mindedness which I feel 1 have es-
tablished, gives me a sincere con-
fidence in my ability to provide lead-
ership which will initiate well
as oversee, and which can bring
back a fundamental contact with the
student which to a large degree has
lost.”

eae To Run For Secretary

Miller Goes After Fancy Dress

Nominations on the University Party’s slate for the up-
coming Big Four election are Chuck Walker for President,
Dave Marchese for Vice President, Joe Framptom for
Secretary, and Joe Miller for Fancy Dress President. Party
Chairman James Jennings announced these choices shortly
after the Party’s clique meeting last Wednesday night. Their
nomination came one week prior to the University election
which will be held next Thursday in the Student Union.

The initial response by clique representatives and others
inside the Party was that their slate was qualified, balanced,
and as Chairman Jennings put it “unbeatable.” Optimism was

high in the University Party for its success not only i in this
election but in the not-far-distant*
class elections. Outside observers |
were somewhat surprised at the
University Party’s apparent unity.
Most had anticipated a party break.

The big news in this election so
far is that all the University Party’s
candidates except Walker may run
unopposed. The nine houses outside

THE RING-TUM PHI

Instant Politics

Ah, spring has come. As the snows melt and the days grow
longer, Pan skips through the Shenandoah Valley, announcing
the annual phenomenon whose all-encompassing affects exempt
not a soul,

To Lexington, Pan carries the expectation of great events:
Goshen becomes congested with inner tubes, Tanya returns,
and the throbbing political id of W&L erupts in campus elec-
tions.

This year, as in every year, the campus will immerse itself
in the art of “instant politics,” where within two weeks it makes,
destroys, and reconstructs strong parties to select, endorse,
campaign for, and elect officers to guide the student body
through the forthcoming year. And finally, as a farewell tribute
to both its efforts of the preceding two weeks and its newly-
elected, the campus promptly devoids itself of political afhlia-
tion, and returns to reap the benefits of Pan, Goshen and
Tanya.

Although this system itself has undergone considerable
criticism, the Ring-tum Phi recognizes its value as a practical
experience in political entanglements. Consequently it en-
courages everyone to participate regardless of party (or
parties). As is reflected in campus attitude, the importance lies
not in the results of these two weeks, but within the activities

yielding these results. H. S. E.

A Realistic Outlook

From all reports and appearances, the clique nominations
for the University Party was a fair and conscientious effort by
the Party to put forth the best candidates available. The nomi-
nations were entirely free of the back-stabbing, appeasements,
and open hostilities which have plagued the unstable political
parties of the past. Though we regret that the University Party
will have no unified opposition, it is nevertheless a healthy sign
for the political condition of this campus that a clique can
operate in such a fashion as to produce efficiently a slate of in-
dividuals who represent the Party as a unit and not as the fac-
tions within it.

As a result of the unity displayed by the University Party
in its nominations, it should be a strong block in the Big Four
elections and, having to assume its success there, should be
doubly strong in the Class Elections.

Although we don’t think it is our function to support or
oppose any of the candidates who have been named so far, we
would very strongly urge that students do not vote on the basis
of whether a candidate has or has not the support of a party.
Though this is a trite election request, we justify it in that votes
against the Party and not positively for either candidate could
be a real danger in this election as a result of the unrealistic
efforts of some groups to malign the party name as necessarily
unrepresentative. Those who have sought to do so obviously
did not realize the ability of the clique to operate in such an
exemplary fashion as it did last Wednesday night.

The candidate’s personal ability to fulfill the responsibilities
of his office should be the electorate’s concern, not the nature
of his backing or the image he conveys.

‘Too Harsh
This editorial appeared in the March 18 edition of the
Hollins Columns during the fraternity controversy aired by
Mr. Beardslee.

The time has come when we can no longer refrain from
adding our two cents to the Beardslee-W&L controversy. At
a penny a word—"Too Harsh.”

Not only too hard on the boys, Mr. Beardslee, and unfair
to single out W&L for the lashing, but too hard on us. We're
self-respecting, we go to the fraternity houses, and have every
intention of continuing to go to them, because we see very
little of what has been discussed as the “usual.” Having at-
tended a goodly number more fraternity parties at W&L than
the chaplain is likely to have attended, I’m ready to defend
them. Not too many of the boys can be called ‘golden drunks”
and even fewer can be “loose lipped”’ before one of their fra-
ternity brothers steps in to protect our virgin ears. (And
speaking of virgin ears—they hear a bit more in the Hollins
dorms than they do in the Lexington fraternity houses—so
maybe the clean-up ought to begin at home.)

In other words, everybody talks about the “numerous”
gross incidents, but it seems likely that when one occurs every-
body discusses it and exaggerates it so that it seems, by the
amount of conversation, to have happened ten times. Neither
can we be called whores for not taking a drunk girl being strip-
ped from a fraternity house if we've never seen a drunk girl
being stripped.

Finally, we'd like to defend the fraternities on general
principles. Different fraternities are made up of different types
of boys and when you date in a particular house you generally
find a whole group of boys that you like, and that have similar
party manners to the person you date, If he respects you, so
will his fraternity brothers. Also, it is the brother who looks
out for his other brothers—and keeps them in line. If there
are houses at W&L where all sorts of crudities occur, then I
agree with Mr. Beardslee, I wouldn't want to go in them. How.
ever, I haven't been in one yet and am inclined to think that
there aren't many there.

 

By ANN JONES
Hollins College

The problem, I think, was born with the man. It is not that
we lack at Hollins the possibility for controversy, the potential
for vital discussion, the other sides of the question. It is that
we are unable or unwilling to ask with honesty the questions
that are meaningful.

We live in our 670 individual worlds as they have been
given to us and defined for us, and we are afraid to wonder.
We live in “that seasonless world where we laugh, but not all
our laughter, and weep, but not all our tears.” We neither

Individual, Social Aspects of Man Discussed

BY CHRIS BARGHOLTZ

February 25th there was a very interesting question asked
in the Hollins Columns, The question, or rather the “theory
with a big question mark,” was put forward by Anne Jones.
As I felt it was a very important one, I would like to contribute
a few question marks and exclamation points to the discussion.

What Anne Jones seems to say is that we ought to stop for
a moment to think, and not to hesitate to ask the basic ques-
tions: what? and why? about life. I wonder what we are sup-
posed to find. The article suggests that we will run into a fear
somewhere deep inside, a fear that we have to fight, and “by

 

Why? Perhaps it is uneasy fear.*
Perhaps we sense that if we look
below our make-up and MecMullens;
our liberal doctrines or our conserva-
tive protestations; our reputations
and images; our letters from Bill and
dozen long-stemmed red roses; our
distinguished families and accept-
able friends; our debutante initiation
or our staunch and pietistic refusal
to be one; the SAE’s and Candy and
Camus, or our imperceptive judg-
ments against them; our convincingly
intelligent and apparently intellec-
tual comments and questions in class;
Beethoven and James Brown and
Picasso and Morgenthau; our judg-
ments about others; Boston, Paris,
Atlanta; our refusal to commit our-
selves or our commitment to so
many things that is no commitment;
behind all this, we silently fear,
there is nothing worth a damn. We
have let all this produce us; we
know it, and we cannot admit it. We
are happy this way, we say, some-
times. Most of the time we don't
wonder about happiness; we are

know we are not joy-filled and we
have been told so many times that
college is the time to be happy, to
enjoy the last hours of freedom. If
we admit we are not happy, we
don’t want to know ultimately why,
for we are afraid of the answer.

We are ultimately dishonest, and
honesty is the basis for any intel-
lectual and meaningful venture. We
accept our rationalizations and our
escapes with ingeniously devised
reasons, so intelligent that they de-
ceive ourselves.

Se we read and talk and think
and act, but we do not know why we
do and we cannot or will not ask.

How can it be that we are so old
in years and so child-like in our
lives? Perhaps it is because we have
never been confronted with a ques-
tion from which there is no exit,
from which we cannot escape by the
means we are so adept at employing
unconsciously. Perhaps we have
never known a person whose very
existence inescapably threatened
ours, whose way of life denied our
own and from whom we could not
turn to our friends and defenders.
Perhaps we have never allowed our-
selves to be alone, and to stand
alone. Perhaps we don’t care at all;
perhaps we care so much that it is;
agony, and we have been told that
suffering is evil and to be avoided
Perhaps we have been loved so long
by so many that we don’t know how
to love.

As long as we allow ourselves to
live this life of half-conscious pas-
sivity and of dishonesty, we can-
not talk about the intellectual cli-
mate at Hollins. Intelligence is not
automatically intellectual; relevant
and piercing commentary in class is
not automatically meaningful; debate
and discussion can be fruitless, if
they lack subjective honesty.

Due to the somewhat vague knowl-
edge that the average student has
concerning the Student Control
Committee, this writer shall en-
deavor to clarify the purpose, the au-
thority and the functions of the
Committee.

The Committee consists of a Chair-
man, two members-at-large, and a
representative from the Law School,
the senior class, the junior class, and
the sophomore class. Members are

the University catalogue the Com-

but rather a judiciary

student behavior generally fall into
one of three categories: complaints
from other colleges; complaints from
the town of Lexington; and com-
plaints from students. These com-
plaints usually reach the committee
respectively from the following
sources: Dean Atwood; Mr. Bob

Of Collegiate Good, Bad

By JANET P. PINKERTON
Assistant Dean, Hollins College
Lecturer in English

Because of the inappropriateness
of bringing up some of these things
in class, I would like to present here
the following worldview:

Things That Are Bad:

The great American middle class.

“Individualism,” because usually a
justification for selfishness.

Founder's Day.

Surburban Protestantism.

Station wagons.

Edgar Allen Poe.

Expectations of “democracy” in
countries (most of the world) ‘hat

do not have Anglo-Saxon traditions. |

Patriotism.

The sacredness of the American
Revolution but the villainy of all
others.

The circumstances of the arrest
of Walter Jenkins.

Middle-class morality, because hy-
pocritical.

Belief that the whole world will
be good when they think and act
just like us.

The _ Eisenhower - Khrushchev
standards of art.

The Reader's Digest, The National
Geographic, and the Encyclopedia
Britannica.

Things That Are Good;

Sympathy with groups (like the
Black Muslims which exist because
of our callousness, injustice, and re-
fusal to understand and sympathize
with others who weren't raised just
like us.

Refusal, therefore, to judge such
groups by our own outraged stand-
ards.

| Honesty.

Herman Melville.

Bob Dylan.
Revolution in certain Latin Amer-
jican countries in attempt to over-
| throw long-standing injustice.

Acceptance of methods of over-
throwing injustices that nevertheless
do not conform to sacred Anglo-
Saxon traditions.

ate humanism.

Refusal to be smug and compla-|
cent.

Antonioni movies.

Beards, because they reject the|
gray-flannel-suit image.

fighting this uneasy fear’ we can create ourselves in the re-
sicunemper saree ——————=kfusal to continue to let ourselves, all

unaware, be created.” But is this
really true? I'm afraid we will find
nothing, a finding that will throw
us only deeper into our despair.What
we need is not to find what is wrong
with us but rather to see that we
share our weaknesses with other
people. ...This sounds like an old
recipe preached for the first fifty
years. But let me explain myself.

I do not believe in the idea that
everyone can and has to help him-
self. We cannot tell people to ask the
ultimate question if there is no an-
swer. What we search for is a mean-
ing in and for life. The traditional
solution is to focus our struggle on
the distant end when we pass into
another world. Today, when the old
religion is losing its grip on us, we
ask for a meaning now, not then, But
what is there to live for? Anne Jones
suggests we have to search ourselves
to find the answer because “we are
all in the end alone.”—No! We are
not.

We must not accept the notion that
we face the most important prob-
lems of life alone. After all, we all
share the same old universe. The old
argument that all of us face death
alone, for example, is totally irrele-
vant. As I see it, death is the least
important occasion in life. We should
not concentrate our struggle on the
evening of our own life, but rather
on the morning of other’s. We are all
members of the community of man-
kind and this is what we have to
live for...not through giving our
citizens better cars, but by partici-
pating in life.

The idea of the individual creat-

/ing himself is absurd. As it has been

said: “People need people to be peo-

ple.” We will not find the answer

in our selves but in our fellow men.

What we lack is enthusiasm and in-

A “warning” may be issued, which
is nothing more than just that—a
warning. “Conduct Probation” is for
a specific length of time but does not
infringe upon the student's social life
in any manner. It merely warns the
student that he had better watch
his step or very serious consequences
might ensue. “Social Probation” pro-
hibits the individual from being on
the premises of his own fraternity
for any reason whatsoever for a
specified length of time. It does not,
however, prohibt the individual from

other seventeen fraternities. “Com-

Phi of last March 12th; and, assum-
ing that he is serious and that he is
not just attempting to be an amateur
iconoclast, 1 find his attitude rather
difficult to understand, especially in
view of the fact that he has lived
with the Honor System for nearly
four years and thus far has managed
to get along with this Olympian
“deity.”

Mr. Harrington has gone entirely
too far in labelling as “heinous un-
truth” the proposition “that intel-
lectuality is not the cardinal test of
a college's worth.” If there is one les-
son which history (particulary intel-
lectual history) makes thoroughly
clear, it is that the human intellect
is incapable of ensuring rectitude in
human conduct.

The desideratum, then, is not an
Honor System which is simply “a
footnote to, an enhancement of, an
added asset of, the Washington and
Lee Community,” however splendid
the community may be. If the Honor
System is worth anything, if it is
fit to be a “system” or a “structural
method” at all, if it is not to degen-
erate into a joke, it must continue to
invade and pervade and, in fact,
deepen all the necessary intellectual-
ity which exists at Washington and
Lee and without which, as Mr. Har-
rington has pointed out, the college
would certainly fail in her intellee-
tual commitment

I should hope that it will be ad
mitted that a scholar whose learning
is informed with honor will neces-
sarily be a better scholar by the
very way in which he possesses and
handles his learning. For one thing
as compared with statements of the
mere servant (who, as some are
may be dishonest), the statements
which the honorable
intellectual will have to say and

crupulously

write ean at least be depended upon

In any case, the lectures and pub-
lieations of the careful and honorable
scholar ‘the Washington and Le
type) will naturally have a more en-
during value. And I offer this as one
conerete (non-sentimental) reason
why there are those of use who cher-

mitted 11 errors, walked 11 men, and!
committed innumerable judgement |
errors, wild pitches, and passed balls.
On the offense, the team got seven
hits, once loaded the bases with no-
body out, but scored their lone run
on three walks and an error.

Starting pitcher Jim Cooper, who
was fairly effective despite being
charged with the loss, gave up one
run on a pair of singles and an in-
field error in the first inning. In the
General half of the frame, Eric Sis-
ler singled, Dave Kirkpatrick was
safe on a fielder’s choice, and Skip
Chase came up with another single
to fill the basses; but all three died
there, and that was as close as W&L
came to being in the contest. The
Generals kept making errors and
the Eagles kept piling up runs off
Cooper and relief man Pete Heu-
mann, Terry Herman, and Bill Ras-
mussen.

Wednesday’s loss was the sixth
straight for the horsehiders, as they
lost all five games on their spring
trip. The first defeat was at the
hands of Elon College by a 3-1 score.
Errors told the story once again as
the winning runs, off reliefer Heu-
mann, came on only one hit. The
General run also came on an error
after Skip Chase singled and Tom
Crenshay walked in the fifth inning.

W&L then moved on to Fort Bragg
for a three-game series. In the first
game with the service team, the
Generals came up with their highest
run total so far, but were outgunned
and lost 9-4. The next day, a fine
performance by pitcher Cooper went
to no avail as Wally Malphrus pitch-
ed a no-hit no-run game to blank
W&L, 2-0.

In the final Fort Bragg game, start-
er Bill Rasmussen was pounded for
eleven runs in the first inning as
sixteen men came to the plate. Terry
Hermann, who finished the game on
the mound, got the only General hit
as the horsehiders were shut out
again, 17-0.

The final stop on the trip was at
Frederick College. Here another
good pitching performance, a five-
hitter by Chris Wigert, was nulli-
fied by errors and weak hitting as
the Generals lost 5-1. Tom Cren-
shaw drove in the lone W&L run.

The Generals travel to Lynchburg
College tomorrow for a 3 p.m. game,
with Wigert expected to start. Next
home game for the team is set for

Doremus Gym Was

Once Considered
“Finest in the South”

By GUY UNANGST
Friday Sportswriter

With plans for a new field house

in the making, and Washington and|

Lee University undergoing its first
“self-study,” the critical eye has

And to think it was once lauded as
“the finest gym in the south,” even
if it was W&L which did the laud-
ing.

That was back in 1914, when Mrs.
Jessie R. Doremus’ gift of the build-
ing was announced. It was to have
“a massive swimming pool, an ade-
quate indoor running track, and
ample seating space.” All that and
handball courts too.

It was modeled after the gym at
Princeton, constructed in the colon-
ial style and cost $100,000. The archi-
techt was Benjamin C. Flournoy,
class of 1897, and it opened January
4, 1914. It was then that the school’s
first compulsory physical education
classes were held.

The gym’s floor is the original, 50
years old after surviving mock cor -
ventions, dances, and ROTC drills
in addition to athletic events. The
first athletic event there was a
basketball game between Fishburne
Military School and Randolph-Macon
Academy. Fishburne won, 17-13. It
was built in memory of Robert Park-
er Doremus, financier and yachtsman
who left the school $1,903,000. W&L’s
largest single endowment now, his
bequest has a market value of more
than two million dollars.

Legend has it that Doremus, while
vacationing in Hot Springs, probably
in 1912, visited the campus and was
so impressed with the courtesy of
a student who showed him aro id
that he gave W&L his entire for-
tune. Maybe he had that rich look

ing an admirable handlebar mous-
tache.

Lacrosse Team Loses to Ohio State;

 

NHU, Hartwick Next General Foes _

With a record of 0-1, the Wash-
ington and Lee lacrosse team will go
after its first two wins of the sea-
son this weekend in games here.

The Generals take on the Univer-
sity of New Hampshire this afternoon
in a game at 3:15. Then tomorrow
afternoon the Generals will face
Hartwick College in a 2:30 game.

The Generals opened the season
with a 7-6 loss to Ohio State right
before spring vacation. The game
went into overtime before the Buck-
eyes were able to come out on top.

The game was well-played in spite
of being held on a very muddy field,
in what Coach Dana Swan described
as “deplorable conditions.” The Gen-
erals had a 6-5 lead going into the
final minute of play, but Ohio State
scored the tying goal with just 49
seconds left.

The Generals had possession of
the ball for much of the game, top-
ping the Ohio club 63-46 in ground
balls and 11-5 in face offs. Pat Rob-

In this special 64-page supplement
in the April issue of Harper's Maga-
zine, 14 distinguished writers discuss
the delicate relationships between
South and North, between Southern
white and Negro; the moods and
fears of the Southern people; the
changing faces of the land and its
cities.

Together, they have placed the last
century in historical perspective,
and created a portrait in depth of
the South today that will surprise
and inform every American.

Contributors include Southern his-
torian C. Vann Woodward, who
shows how the North helped but-
tress and condone racial seerega-
tion: James J. Kilpatrick, conserva-
tive editor of the Richmond News
Leader, who believes that the South
will solve its racial problems quicker
and with greater maturity than the
North: Negro author Louis E. Lo-
max observing the changes in both
races in his home town of Valdosta,
Georgia: Fonathan Daniels, editor of
the Raleigh News & Observer, dem-
onstrating how Southern industrial
growth continues to make victims of
its people; child psychiatrist Robert
Coles investigating the human im-
pact of school desegregation

Among the other contributors are
novelist William Styron, British his-
torilan D, W. Brogan, novelist
Walker Percy, Whitney M. Young,

ertson alone was responsible for 19
of the ground balls.

General goals were scored by |
Jackson, Pittman, Bowersox, Daes-|
ner, Michaels, and Robertson. Assists
were turned in by Michaeles, Robert-|
son, Klinglehofer, and Ostroff.

The big problem for the Generals
was they didn’t take enough shots.
They took just 26 in the game. As
a result Coach Swan had the Gen-
erals working on offense in practice
this last week. He said, you really
need about 50 shots per game to do
well.”

Ohio State is rated as one of the
top teams in the country. They're
listed as the team to beat this year |
in the Midwest Lacrosse Federation. |

Looking ahead to this weekend's
games, the one this afternoon against
New Hampshire rates as a real tough
one. The team is described as big and
aggressive,

Tennis Team
Opens Season

With 9-0 Win

From the results of their first game,
it looks like the General tennis team
could be headed for a good season.

Wednesday the Generals opened
the season with a 9-0 victory over
Bridgewater in a match there. And
the top three General racketmen
didn’t even play.

Sweep Singles Matches

Forrest Dickinson opened the af-
ternoon for the Generals with a 6-2,
6-1 victory over Tom Scordaas. Phil
Thompson took the next match, beat-
ing Andy Hayes 8-6, 6-2. Howard
Busse then added a victory over
Kirk Stokes by 6-1, 6-3. Other vic-
tories were taken by Fred Webb over
Eddie Higgs, 6-1, 6-1; Dick Bradford
over Gordon White, 6-2, 6-0; and
Dick Crook over Jay LaViolette,
6-0, 6-0.

The Generals also swept all three
double matches with the team of
Dickinson and Thompson beating
the team of Scordaas and Hayes,
6-2, 6-2. The team of Busse and
Webb then added a 6-0, 6-1 victory
over Bridgewater’s team of Stokes
and Higgs. The final General victory
was picked up by the team of Steve
Case and Torrey Armstrong over
White and LaViolette of Bridgewater
by scores of 6-0, 6-1.

Face Hampden-Sydney Next

The next game will pit the Gen-
erals against Hampden-Sydney
here a week from today at 3:15. This
should be a good match as Hamp-
den-Sydney opened the season with
a 9-0 win over Lynchburg. The Gen-
erals are expected to be in top shape
for the game. Coach Canfield de-
clined to predict a winner, saying
it should be a close match.

‘We Must Be Honest Alone’

(Continued from page 2)

And the beauty and the wonder
of it is that by fighting this “un-
easy fear’ we can create ourselves
in the refusal to continue to let
ourselves, all unaware be created.
As Gibran has said,

“You shall be free indeed when
your days are not without a care
nor your nights without a want and
grief,

But rather when these things girdle
your life and yet you rise above
them naked and unbound.

And how shall you rise beyond
your days and nights unless you
break the chains which you at the
dawn of your understanding have
fastened about your noon hour?”

This answer to the question
“Where lies the problem.” is by its
nature tentative and uncertain. My
purpose in writing is to ask a ques-
tion more than to offer an answer
or a solution: Is what I have said
meaningful to you? Do you think
part of the problem lies here? It
is in your answers and in the dia-
logue which might result, among all
of us, the younger students, who pay
to be here and the older students
who are paid, that we can begin to
learn, to grow, to have an “intellec-
tual climate” at Hollins. We are all,
in the end, alone, and we must be
honest alone. Yet the attempt to
communicate and in so doing to open
ourselves to the risk of rejection,
or the joy of human love, is essen-
tial to the process of becoming alive.

So we can still wear our McMul-
lens, listen to Beethoven, read Candy,
get high, rollerskate around front
quad, scream, cry, laugh—for these
things in themselves are neither
good nor bad. What matters is why.
This I do believe, for the time be-
ing.

terest, interest in the life of others.
The despair of man is not the result
of a fruitless search for the basi:
values in himself, but rather the re-
sult of a lack of understanding.

“There is a light at the horizon
that I don’t see

There is a voice in the darkness
that I don’t hear

There is someone somewhere
..- 1 don’t understand.”

Our problem is not that we are
alone, but that we think we are.
We cannot see that we are surround-
ed by people and life, and that we
are a part of it. But how are we
supposed to understand? When we

games under their belt by the time
they get here. Yesterday they played
Duke, and the day before North
Carolina.

The Generals are in pretty gbood
shape for the games although two
players have complained of back in-
juries. The big trouble for the Gen-
erals remains offense. Coach Swan
expressed the belief that this last
week’s practice had helped clear up
that problem.

The Generals’ game against Hofs-
tra, which was cancelled because of
rain and muddy fields, on March 27,
has been rescheduled for April 28.

search ourselves we do not find any
answer. The solution might be par-
ticipation in life, in our own as well
as in others’. When I say we lack
enthusiasm and interest, I do not
mean enthusiasm “a la” P.T.A. but
rather that of a general “I want” and
“T can.”

I think there are two main ideas
with which we have all been indoc-
trinated and which make for our
despair: the idea “the basic values
which are to be found through
knowing yourself,” and “the theory
of the overall ranging importance of
death as a time when our life is
being judged.”

...Perhaps we all have to cre-
ate the values by Living together.

... Perhaps we need other people
in order to understand ourselves

... Perhaps the idea of life is Life
and not death.

If this is so, we must not, through
isolation, kill each other.

Editorial Cartoonist Stirs,
Borgstedt Tells SIPA Meet

By CHARLES FISHBURNE

Douglas Borgstedt, editorial car-
toonist for King Features Syndicate,
addressed a gathering of 500 high
school journalists and advisors at
Washington and Lee University here
today on “Inside Editorial Cartoon-
ing.”

A cartoonist is “not trying to put
forth any final touch of logic,” he
said, “he is a needler, a stimulator
of thought, he stirs up the pot.”

A good cartoonist, he added, should
have a sense of humor, curiosity, “a
good nose for news,” ability to ana-
lyze and simplify, an understanding
of human nature, a strong artistic
style and affinity for characteriza-
tions, and originality of ideas
Dilemma

In the past few years, he said, the
editorial cartoonists have suffered,
have been toned down as the result
of newspaper group ownership, less

Cartoonists’

“1 and less direct competition between
| papers of opposing views, the evolu-

tion of journalism into “more of a
and the
advent of television.

The biggest threat to the role of
the contemporary cartoonist is tele-
vision, he said, but this has failed
to materialize because “television
has not stood up to be counted as
an opinion-maker. The cartoonist
and the drawing board remain the

true standard bearer when it comes
to visual comment and interpreta-
tion,” he added

Borgstedt showed some of his more
recent cartoons to the group and
drew several freehand to illustrate
his techniques

Said Borgstedt, “You've got to go
for broke in drawing a cartoon; there
is no provision tor

Pennsylvania Dutch farmhouse in
Bryn Mawr, Pr., was born in West-
chester County, N. Y.

Borgstedt showed an early interest
in visual expression, possibly stem-
ming from his father’s work as an
engineer and draftsman. He sold his
first drawing at 12, winning first
prize of $5 in a magazine contest.
In fact, within two years, he was
discreetly asked to “retire” from
competition because he won so many
prizes in the magazine's monthly
art contests.

He was educated at the Cathedral

School, Haverford College, and the

SIPA Formed
39 Years Ago
As Stimulant

In April of 1926, the Lee Memorial
Journalism Foundation at Washing-
ton and Lee decided to try something
new—a meeting of high school
journalists from all over the South.

A total of 76 delegates from 11
states attended that 1926 convention
By 1941, at the seventeenth annual
convention, the official registration
showed more that 500 students at-
tended

This year there are approximately
1,000 students from eight states at-
tending the Southern Interscholastic
Press Association Convention

The continued interest and success
of the annual conventions has made
remark: “The organiza-

Au Revoir, Mrs. Fallwell

Ocassionally, there develops in society a person so intelli-
gent, so warm and understanding, so wonderful, that when
this individual passes away, many and varied interests mourn
the passing. Such a person was Mrs. Henriette Messager Fall-
well.

Mrs. Fallwell, who taught in the Roanoke, Virginia, school
system for 34 years, died in March. Her smile, charm, and
teaching techniques inspired countless high school students of
French during those precious three and one-half decades.

But Mrs.
her French courses. It extended to numerous other areas of
life, including publications.

While on the faculty of Jefferson Senior High School,
she founded “L’Echo de Roanoke,”’ the first foreign language
newspaper in a Virginia secondary school. The newspaper,
written and published entirely in the French language, was
frequently recognized by the Southern Interscholastic Press
Association, and by other associations, for its exceptionally
high merit.

Believing the newspaper to be a superb means of develop-
ing in her students, at the same time, -— observation, good
writing and good French, she created “La Liberte” upon
joining the faculty of Patrick Henry High School, also in
Roanoke. Both journals continue to lowsich,

Fallwell’s influence was hardly contained within

Mrs. Fallwell retired in June, 1963. With her went a large
number of awards she had won, including the Distinguished
Service Award of S. I. P. A., presented to her at the awards

 

THE RING-TUM PHI

Oldest Journalism Instruction In Nation,
Begun By Lee, Not What It Used To Be

W&L Alumnus
Contrasts Old,

New Facilities

By JOHN HUGHES
Washington and Lee,
SIPA Delegate, °51

Che department of journalism and
communications, now safely en-
sconced in its four-story brick tower
called Reid Hall, is a far ery from
what it was just a few years ago.

The same professors are there, but
the facilities they now have are
vastly improved.

The “J-School” graduates o f a
few years back—CBS’ Roger Mudd
(50), Richmond Times-Dispatch
columnist Charley McDowell ('48),
Washington and Lee’s assistant di-
rector of information services, John
Hughes ('55), remember the old
days what it used to be like.

There was only one classroom, and
there was an adjoining room which

Reid Hall Renovated for Journalism

story, and I had always heard that
when something really BIG occur-
red—such as the attack on Pearl
Harbor or the end of World War IIl—
the bell would ring five times.

I was sitting in the library one
day, in 1954, not paying any atten-
tion to the teletype, when it sud-
denly occurred to me that I had just
heard five bells. I rushed to the ma-
chine, and read words to this effect:

“Washington, D.C. — May 17 —
(AP)—The Supreme Court today
declared the ‘separate but equal’
doctrine of school segregation un-
constitutional...”

I guess in terms of subsequent
events, that story merited five bells.

The “other room” also functioned
as a classroom and as a news room,
where the journalism students re-
turned from their “beats” and wrote
their stories. At night, the room be-
came a broadcasting studio, and the
students broadeast our stories over
the air on “Home Edition,” then as
now the only local daily news source
in Rockbridge County.

The “other room” had anothe
funetion for me. Under Washington
and Lee’s honor system, I could
easily obtain permission from pro-
fessors to take my exams in the

room, because it had typewriters in

press myself better, and quicker,
on an exam if I typed it.
Later, another nearby classroom

was converted into a broadcasting
studio. But these were the facili-
ties until the J-School moved into
its new quarters. The improvement
is obvious to anyone who takes a
short tour of the new facilities.

Lee the Pioneer

If the facilities seem archaic to
what is now present, it was even
more so in the beginning. The new
Reid Hall facilities are quite an
improvement on Gen. Lee’s original
thoughts that after the Civil War,
the South’s greatest need was
informed and competent leadership
in commerce, law and government,
engineering and public opinion.

In 1869, at Gen. Lee’s instigation,
the college offered 50 “press schol-
arships” and instruction in journal-
ism was begun. The scholarships
were to go to young men “propos-
ing to make printing or journalism
their profession.”

Maj. John J. Lafferty, editor of
a Lexington newspaper, The Virginia
Gazette, was appointed to the col-
lege faculty, and his print shop was
chosen as the “laboratory” for in-
structing the students.

Unfortunately, Gen. Lee died the
next year and the project bore
little fruit. The proposed scholar-

plan for journalism instruction was
dropped in 1878.

It wasn’t until 1925 that Lee’s pro-
posal was actually brought into full
reality. In that year, the Southern
Newspapers Publishers Association
endowed the Lee Memorial Journal-
ism Foundation—which flourishes to-
day in its new brickery tower.

Reid Hall was renovated for the
Department of Journalism and Com-
munications in 1963-64, 60 years
after its construction. The large
building contains 15,780 square feet
of floor space.

Floor plan of Reid Hall

The general plan of the structure
is as follows:

Ground floor—Printing laboratory
including composing room, work
folding and binding room, press room
stock room, mailing room, and office
space.

Second floor — Academic head-
quarters, including auditorium and
projection room, library, student
lounge, film library, seminar room,
library archives and storage room
and office space.

Third floor — Laboratories and
workrooms, including newsroom,
wire room, broadcasting studios A,
B, and C, control room, film editing
room, advertising laboratory, tape
library, record library, and office’
space.

Fourth floor—Photographic print-
ing rooms and darkrooms.

Riegel Welcomes SIPA Weather 5 IPA Vusztors

Professor O. W. Riegel, chairman of the Lee Memorial Journal-

the customary remarks, but he placed especial emphasis on the

weather.
He called it “SIPA weather.”

Traditionally, Riegel remarked,

In announcing his candidacy, Les
iid that he feels that as an inde-
pendent candidate, he will not be
obligated to any group or faction
and will be able to represent a
breader section of the student body

Summing up his views, the can-
didate said, “I feel that a student |
can run successfully as an inde |
pendent in a broadly-based, non-
fraternity-dominated political sys-
tem. Not only does this transfer

more initiative to the student body,
it also gives them more of a voice
in an invigorating, active student
government,”

Neely Young says that he has en-
tered the race for secretary because
he that “this position in the
student body is too important to be
a clique.” He feels that
for the EC should go
unopposed as a matter of principle.

Young has been consistently on
Dean's List and Honor Roll, and
was chosen for Phi Eta Sigma his
freshman year. He now serves as
Vice-President of Phi Eta Sigma,
as a fraternity officer, and as chair-
man of the UCA’s Community

By Tuesday Staff
Thursday’s elections, testing
the new University Party in
campus elections for the first
time, remain in question to-

day despite the apparent dis-
unily of its opponents.

The Party slate, which at first was
faced only at one position—that of
president, with Fred Mindel running
running against Party candidate
Chuck Walker— now is opposed for
vice president and secretary.

Bob Lee, running independently
against Party candidate Dave Mar-
chese for vice president, by all po-
litical talk has a chance to upset the
Party. Neely Young, the last candi-
date to declare and apparently some-
thing of a protest candidate, is re-
garded as having almost no possible
chance to upset the Party’s Joe

The race between Mindel and
Walker for the top office is the most
actively contested and is looked upon
by many as the closest. If the Party
cannot elect Walker, regarded as a
nominee for the presidency not only
this year but last year, it will be in
serious trouble trying to preserve a
Party ine in upcoming class elections.

History of Flux

The political order on campus is
currently in a state of flux from
which it seems unlikely to stablize
itself. In order to understand the
president dilemma look at the re-
cent history of campus politics is es-
sential.

It was in the spring of 1963 that
the traditional party composition
was fundamentally altered. At that
time the old University Party and
the now xtienct Independent Party

a totally new alliance called the Pro-
gressive Party. The nine houses left
out of this new party pulled them-
selves together under the banner of
the old University Party.

The Progressive Party enjoyed a
majority position in campus elec-
tions for the next year, although it
failed to solve the problem of clique
dominated polities, i.e., satisfying its
member houses. Once again in the

 

Campus Political T
Promises Unique Election

   

spring of 1964 both political parties
were destroyed by internal riffs. For
several fraternities this split result-
ed in a complete rejection of campus
political parties in general and the
clique system specifically.
Liberty Party

Following the elections last spring
the Liberty Party was formed with
the expressed intention of eliminat-
ing the evils inherent in the clique
system. It was this party, consisting
of ten houses, which was unable to

survive even one election. In the
ruins of the Liberty Party a new
coaliation which very much resem-

bled the original University Party
managed to sweep freshman EC
election of last fall.

Thursday's election centers on a
contest between the only organized
political party on campus, the Uni-
versity Party, and independent op-

position. In political science termin-
ology there exists a rather signifi-
cant power vacuum in the present
sSlal

of affairs

The extent of this vacuum can only
be determined by the outcome of this
election. It is safe to say that a one-
party system does not necessarily
create a health ypolitical climate.

The presidential contest promises
to focus attention on a conflict be-
tween progressives and conservative
elements of the student body. Walker
relying on old line houses and the
Law School, and Mindel the inde-

pendents and remaining fraternities

. Although this is definitely an over-

simplification it points out the gen-
eral nature of the campaign. Walker:
will probably rely on strong sup-
port not only from his own party,
but also the law schol and certain
independent groups. Mindel must
concentrate on the fraternities which
have renounced any party affiliation
as well as on seattered support from
individuals within the University

Party and the law school

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association
Tuesday Edition

The Qualifications, The Issues

As former president Eisenhower said of last fall’s
national election, “It’s confusing.” For the first time with-
in memory the perennial majority party, the University
Party is unopposed by any semblance of an opposition
party. Yet strangely, the result is that without the threat
of an opposition ticket, the Party voters seem to be ex-
aming individual qualifications to an unusual degree—at
least in the elections which are being contested by inde-
pendent candidates.

Despite the dampening effect on the campaign which
has been caused by the absence of a contest for one of
the four offices, the top three spots are being sought
hotly. No office and particularly neither of the top two
positions, is in the University Party bag, although the
Party candidates certainly have the advantage in organ-
ization. Because individual qualifications are so important,
the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi feels justified in presenting an
analysis of the qualifications of the four men running
for president and vice president of the student body.

A student newspaper must be a commentator on the
facts, as well as a reporter of them. At times, our com-
ment has aroused little interest in the student body; at
other times we have stirred up strong objection. But
throughout the year our policy has been to present issues
as we have seen them, regardless of the currents of ma-
jority opinion. It is on such an occasion as a campus elec-
tion that the newspaper should be most vocal. A news-
paper must not make the mistake of cherising impartiality
to the point of ineffectuality.

The race for the presidency is between two men who
have served well together as junior class EC representa-
tives. Chuck Walker, Kappa Sigma, is an Honor Roll
and Dean’s List student who is completing his second
year on the EC. His soundness as an EC member, with
his high grades, have made Walker an obvious, even a
groomed choice fo rthe Party nomination all along. Walk-
er is highly qualified on the basis of campus activities: he
is a varsity cross-country runner, a member of SWMSFC
and Liberty Hall Society, was the IFC outstanding Fresh-
man in 1963; and his honoraries include the economics
and commerce fraternities and Phi Eta Sigma.

Fred Mindel, Zeta Beta Tau, was the first candidate to
declare himself in opposition to the Party. The fact that
he was not pushed into the race by his fraternity nor by
any organization, attests to Mindel’s initiative; as do his
record on the EC and his platform. He is a Dean’s List
student, a varsity basketball player, was a Mock Con-
vention state chairman, and is a member of ODK, the
student Service Society and Liberty Hall Society.

Mindel’s main attractiveness is that he represents a
spirit of enthusiasm in student government, something
which has long been lacking here. The general apathy
which now greets the EC at every turn cannot be all the
fault of the student body; some of it, if not most of it,
must be laid to the EC’s failure to assume initiative. Min-
del’s conviction that the students will support an active
leadership on the part of the EC is refreshingly idealistic.
It compares favorably with Walker's quietly capable but
stolid attitude; it is what gives Mindel a chance to upset
the Party in this election, and it is what moves the Ring-
tum Phi to endorse Mindel’s candidacy.

The difference between these two able men is that
Walker represents the Old Guard, and Mindel the new.
In EC debate throughout the year this has been the sit-
uation: Walker defending the status quo, and Mindel
seeking new solutions to old problems. Walker is in the
line of Jim Kulp, Bill Noell, and Tim Ireland, the last
three student body presidents; certainly he would not dis-
associate himself from such old line leaders as these, even
if he could. These are the men who have made our student
government what it is. Mindel, on the other hand, presents
a fresh approach. His platform contains some of his new
ideas and other than that his EC recod supports his stand
as a man with a new attitude: that the EC must seek out
the answers in areas it ha sneglected in the past, and that
it is the president who will lead the search for answers.

Mindel’s appeal rests also with the fact that his ap-
proach just happens to fit with the changing face of Wash-
ington and Lee. The University is on the threshhold of
great advances in every way; it is Mindel who would fit
into the picture of such progress. Walker, though a fine
defender of the qualities the school already has, cannot
match Mindel in guiding the student body forward.

Mindel’s record on the EC gives credibility to his
statements and his platform of dynamic leadership. He
had the originality earlier this year to poll the class he
represents on issues he felt he might be voting on during
the year. The EC debate he has been consistent in sup-
porting ideas for improvement; but his ideas for change
have always been tempered with regard for the benefits
of the existing structure.

Judging from past year,s camapign platforms mean
little at W&L; but Mindel’s platform, if it means anything,
much better than the Party platform. The
Party platform is actually weaker than last year's Party
platform. With Mindel’s enthusiasm for what he is stand-

is a good one

THE RING-TUM PHI

Opponents Clash On Issues

 

Top Candidates Make Election Statements

Fred Mindel

Candidate for President

In the Presidential election, there
will be a clear-cut choice betwen
my attitude, perspective, and E.C.
record and those of my opponent,
Chuck Walker. This difference in our
attitudes toward the principle of “ac-
tive representation,’ (where E.C.
seeks out, expresses, and carries out,
when called for, student consensus)
as well as our fundamental disparity
in general frame of mind, may be
clearly and concisely illuminated by
our actions on the E.C. this year.
Four specific points should sufficient-
ly in dicate this distinet difference.

1) Despite my relating the results
of a questionnaire I distributed with-
in the Junior Class (which on the
subject of Conventional dress showed
almost the same percentage of dissat-
isfied students as the school-wide
referendum) and my urging that we
further investigate this area before
approving a Convention Dress policy,
my opponent still voted positively
to adopt a policy which totally ne-
glected this majority sentiment. I
voted negatively.

2) In subsequent discussion on how
to interpret the Conventional Dress
referendum, my opponent refused
to support in discussion or give more
than token lip service to the fact that
although no specific modifications
could be made at the time, never-
theless a majority of those who voted
expressed dissatisfaction. This meant
to me that further and more specific
investigation was not only warrant-
ed, but mandatory.

3) During discussion of a proposed
change in election procedure, my
opponent openly stated before the
E.C. that “the student body as a
whole is not capable of choosing its
own candidates.” I strongly disagreed
in supporting the proposed amend-
ment requiring open nominating con.
ventions, stating that I did fee}
that W&L students were capable of
making their own choice and that
they must be given this opportunity

4) Despite his lack of faith in our
student body to choose its own can.
didates, my opponent voted in favor
of the proposed amendment which
required open nominating conven-
tions. This proposal passed the E.C,
almost unanimously and was favor-
ed more than 2 to 1 by those voting
in the referendum, though it failed to
receive the needed majority to be
put into effect. A motion was made
during the next E.C. meeting to re~
submit the proposal, and now my
opponent voted negatively. Had he
mentioned in his discussion that he
had subsequently found flaws in the
proposal or had somehow come to
believe that it was no longer feas-
able or possible, his negative vote
would have been justified. I do not
believe his comment on why he now
opposed the same plan he only a
few weeks earlier favored, “because
he had never heard of a precedent

(Continued on page 3)

Chuck Walker
Candidate for President

This nomination comes to me as a
high honor and I deeply appreciate
it. To demonstrate my appreciation
I feel it is incumbent upon me to
seek election purely on the basis
of the validity of my past service to
Washington and Lee and the validity
of the proposals I am_ presenting.
The only sincerely approach, I feel,
is one based on the critical examina-
tion of every aspect of Washington
and Lee life and on the willingness
to analyze and correct deficiencies
of that life while attempting to pre-
serve the unique ideals and heritage
of this university.

If experience is of any value as a
qualification for this office, I have
served Washington and Lee for three
years. I personally feel that it has
benefited me a great deal. Of more
importance, however, I hope to bring
before the Student Body certain
ideas and proposals that are more
than abstract campaign promises.

A Dynamic Leadership Forum

In this spirit, | am proposing a
more dynamic role for the ODK
Leadership Forum. This organization
has done yeoman service in the past
by sponsoring discussion on vital is-
sues affecting Washington and Lee.
I wish to see this body strengthen-
ed. It should be open to any stu-
dent who wishes to protest on a
particular issue or to bring up a
problem for consideration; it should
be able to collect all the necessary
data bearing on a problem so that
it may make a comprehensive and
coherent report o fits findings; and it
should present such information to
the Executive Committee for possible
executive action.

It should be concerned primarily
with finding the vital issues and
problems in our campus life, for the
Executive Committee, because of its
other duties, cannot efficiently serve
this need. I wish to make the ODK
Leadership Forum a legitimate ve-
hicle of student protest, a means of
bringing the best minds in the Stu-
dent Body to bear on the problems
that face this university. I believe
that this will encourage student re-
sponsibility, broaden the quality and
quantity of effective student lead-
ership ,and embody a practical so-
lution to offset the frustration ac-
companing student protests and
discussion.

Freshman Dormitory Committee

I also propose a new Freshman
Dormitery committee, made up of the
Head Dorm Counselor, his three As-
sistants Heads, and the new fresh-
ean class officers. This committee
would assume the duties and respon-
sibilities heretofore exercised by the
Dean of Students, therefore acting to
more effectively bring the freshman
class under aegis o {student govern-
ment. In the same area, I propose
that all freshmen, at some time dur-
ing the coming year, be invited to

(Continued on page 4)

 

Framptom,

Joe Frampton
Candidate for Secretary

The office which I seek requires «
dual role. In addition to performing
duties peculiar to his office, the
Secretary of the Student Body will
sit also as a regular member of the
Executive Committee. In this light
I feel it necessary to state several
personal views. First, | support the
Honor System as the most valuable
asset of Washington and Lee. The
Executive Committee must maintain
the System through responsibile
judgment and a full awareness . of
personal freedom. Second, | intend to
support conventional dress as a time-
honored tradition which helps make
Washington and Lee unique. Third,
1 regret the depletion of the speak-
ing tradition and believe that the
Executive Committee should seek
methods to revive it

The duties I entend to perform as
Secretary of the Student Bedy are
several. First, as a Student Bedy
officer. I will assist and acrve the
President in order to facilitate the
operation of the Executive Committe
Second, I feel a need to be punctual
and therough in the general clerical
duties which I must perform. Third,
I believe there exists a definite
need to keep the Student Hedy wel!
informed about the operation of the
Executive Committee. Therefore. |
intend to continue the practice of
posting minutes and notices in pub-
lic places as a toward better
communications between the
Executive Committee and the Stu-
dent Hedy

I wish my ability

the Executive Committee to he

Bob Lee
Candidate for Vice President

There are several reasons why I
have decided to run for the Vice
Presidency of the Student Body.
Principal among these is my firm
conviction that no candidate, re-
gardless of his ostensible qualifica-
tions, should run unopposed for so
high an office.

Secondly, and let me assure you,
I would not have decided to run
for the office of Vice President un-
less I were firmly convineed that
I could properly dischages the re-
sponsibilities of the office. I feel my-
self suitably qualified; if I didn’t, I
would not have made the decision
to announce my candidacy.

Also, I believe that as the cam-
paign develops there will emerge is-
sues on which my opponent and I
fundamentally disagree.

Frankly, what are these so-called
issues. The first, and most important,
is our Honor System. It has become
demonstrably clear that our Honor
System is the single most distinctive
aspect of Washington and Lee Uni-
versity. Our Honor System is an ef-
fective one, but we must never lose
sight of the faet that it could per-
haps be made more effective and that
it must always remain consonant
with prevaling concepts of “justice.”
Is our Honor System distinctive be-
cause it has retained over the years
the “absolute penalty,” or is it dis-
tinctive because it works, and is
the fact that it does work inextrica-
bly tied with the absolute penalty. I
believe the Honor System works
because the students at W&L believe
in it and want to see it work. I do
not believe that it has worked over
the years because the students are
“eowered” into honesty by the fear
of the absolute penalty. Recently, it
has it has been shown that breaches
of law and of honesty are related not
to the magnitude or servity of
punishment for such breaches, but
to the chances of being caught. I
believe that students who observe
honor violations are presently hesi-
tant to report such offenses because
they fear that in reporting them they
will be destroying some student's life.
Regardless of the validity of such
a feeling, it is probable that a modi-
fication of the penalty wil lereate a
more healthy atmosphere on campus
and will induce those who have mor-
al reservations against reporting of-
fenses to report them. A vear's sus-
pension will serve equally as well
as the absolute penalty in discour-
aging violations. We must never for-
get that a system of justice, and in-
deed our Honor System is such, must
not ignore that all men are capable
of committing breaches of honer un-
der extraordinary circumstances and
that mercy in such instances is
justice. We should seek to rehabili-
tate the individual, not turn our
backs on him.

Conventional dress is another eon-

Dave Marchese
Candidate for Vice President

In any _ political election, the
qualifications of the candidates could
stir much interest among the voting
body; in the allotted space I hope
to reveal this factor as it reflects
on my candidacy.

What exactly should qualifications
mean to us at Washington and Lee?
The campaign posters which “deco-
rate” our campus this week attempt
to present a brief resume of the can-
didates major significant contribu-
tions and accomplishments.

I feel my qualifications sive an in-
dication of my involvement in stu-
dent body life. If I didn’t believe
I were qualified for the position or
could effectively represent the stu-
dent body I would not have sought
the office for Vice-President. The
experience gained from such invol-
vement in student body life has been
immensely beneficial. It has provided
me with a knowledge of the work-
ings of the Student government as
well as the opportunity to commun-
icate and work with many students.

In addition to qualifications, the
views and ideas advocated by each
candidate should be of prime concern
to the electorate.

Honor System

The primary issue in this race con-
cerns the Honor System. I would like
to make it clear from the start my
position in this regard: I wholeheart-
edly oppose the changes which have
been proposed this year. Whereas
my opponent advocates a one year
penalty as sufficient punishment for
a breach of our honor code. I fell
that such an arrangement would not
only be disagreeable to the majority
of the student body, who come to
Washington and Lee admiring such a
system and realizing that the inevi-
table consequence of such a breach
of honor would permanently disas-
sociate with. Washington and Lee;
but also the change would be detere-
mental to the attitudes of individ-
ual students whose concept of hon-
or and integrity would be relegated
to an apathetic disillusionment with
the system. By accepting and under-
standing the system as it now stands
we learn from the past the ideals
and concepts upon which the system
was intended to exist. Hopefully,
this experience will guide us in fu-
ture endeavors.

While we have seen this system
violated and threatened seriously
in the past (early 1950's seandal)
we have also seen how it has with-
stood such attacks only to live as
strong as under its original
guise. To change Washington and
Lee whenever one sees fit does not,
] feel, necessitate a change in the
most nationally, locally and person-
ally revered traditions of our in-
stitution. It appears to me that after
Mr. Lee's change, Washington and
Lee would not be the Washington
and Lee we admire and know has

for such aetion,” nor his attitude
that the E.C. gave the students their
chance and this they forfeited, are
anywhere near my belief in “active
representation” or my view of the
positive lead the President of the
Student Body must take.

One eriticism that I have heard
voiced to some of my ideas is the
fact that “active representation”
would be often difficult to achieve,
especially in the light of the poor
turnout for the two referendums
this year. My opponent told me vir-
tually the same thing when told of
my plan to poll members of our
class. My response to this criticism

concisely sums up my basic at-
titude toward the E.C. student

leadership and our school in gen-
eral: If I was able, working merely
with a friend in each fraternity house
plus several independent students,
to successfully poll over 65 per cent
of my class in only three days, there

is absolutely no reason why the E.C.,|'

especially in conjunction with such
bodies as the Assimilation Committee
or the LF.C. and Independent Union,
could not receive a much wider stu-
dent consensus provided proper
handling was insured. If leaders are
positive enough, want to accomplish
something badly enough, and are

willing to devote the necessary time!

and energy toward this goal, the job
not only can be, but will be done.
The Problem

At the present moment our cam-|
crisis in|
leadership. We are without a positive |

pus is suffering from a
channel by which to effectively seek
out, express and/or enact student
consensus. Despite the now almost
trite statements that the student
body in general is apathetic, there
definitely exists energy as well as
attempts at leadership, but these are
without a cohesive, directive, and
“representative” lead. There are cer-

tain areas where our trustees and
administration refuse to take the
initiative; therefore it is up toe the

students to act through their elected
representative body, the EC., to
alleviate areas of dissatisfaction and
that the needed improvements
are not neglected. But the E.C. can
only successfully take this positive
and initiative leadership if such a
tone is set by the President, which
was not the ease this year. Though
attempts at initiative and represen-
tative leadership were certainly made
by certain members of this year’s
committee, these were hampered by
the tone that

urged along with others, would have

contested game, which the Generals
might have won had it not been for

nate the following afternoon, as

Editorial Comment On Candidates

(Continued from page 2)
ing for in this campaign—and if his record is any indication—
there is every belief that he will carry out his platform if he is
elected. Mindel’s platform would be enacted with great benefit;
but it is not as important, we think, as is the new attitude he
represents.

One last piece of evidence in favor of Mindel is perhaps
crucial: that he has been endorsed by four of the most influ-
entional members of the E.C. Three of those publishing a
letter for Mindel are members of the University Party which
he opposes; but as in past years, party ties cannot restrict the
strong feeling which most E.C. members have regarding the
election of a new president of the Student body. The fourth
E.C. member to support Mindel is a law student. Mindel had
no “political” allies on the E.C., i.e., every undergraduate
member of the Committee is a member of Walker’s political
party. By his idealism and his striking leadership attracted such
voluntary endorsement none the less.

Vice President

For vice presidency, Dave Marchese and Bob Lee present
another very tight contest. Marchese, a Phi Gam, is a member
of ODK, a Dean’s List student, president of the junior class,
and president of this year’s Springs weekend. He is president
and past rush chairman of his fraternity, is an officer in
SWMSEC and a member of SSS. He has been outstanding
in debating activities. The extent of Marchese’s activities indi-
cates a real interest in student body affairs; a real ability to
get things accomplished; and a personal initiative in leadership.

Bob Lee, a Phi Psi, is vice president of the junior class, an
officer of SSS and a member of SWMSFC. He is president of
his fraternity, is a member of the Assimilation Committee, and
is a section editor of the Calyx. Lee is also a member of the
commerce fraternity, the Liberty Hall Society, and the “13”
Club. These activities and a strong personality have made Lee
a good possibility to upset Marchese and the Party. However,
Lee’s qualifications just can’t measure up to those of Marchese
in extent and evidence of initiative. In addition to this, Lee’s
grades are very low for a candidate for student body office.
Lee has issued a statement affirming his support for chang-
ing the Honor System to institute a penalty of suspension;
this stand is consistent with past statements made by him. We
feel that this proposal, if ever enacted, would be disastrous for
the Honor System, and that to elect a man running on such
a stand would be to put support where it would be ill used.

A vote for Lee is a vote for this platform; while a vote for
Marchese is a vote for responsibility and initiative in student
government; therefore the Ring-tum Phi urges Marchese’s|

 

 

election.

Just as the newspaper choice of candidates has straddled
Party lines, we also urge every student to cast his vote irrespec- |
tive of Party lines; only in this way will a responsible student,

government be maintained.

parties are needed at W&L, indeed
I think they are a detriment. I feel
their abolition could be accomplish-
ed by first primaries—to bring poli-
ties into the open, and second, my
election—to show to the cliques that
the W&L Student Body is opposed to
this system.

I wholeheartedly support Conven-
tional Dress as a worthwhile tradi-
tion of our campus, but I am not in
favor of an Assimilation Committee
which is based on a_ spoils system
for the fraternities and which makes
Conventional Dress a rule rather thn
a tradition. I am in complete dis-
agreement with the interpretation of
the recent Conventional Dress refer-
endum in which a majority of the
students who voted showed some
dissatisfaction with the present sys-
tem. I believe that I have sufficiently
shown my interest in the subject by
being one of the original signers of
the petition requesting that referen-
dum. If elected, I will work to make
Conventional Dress a real tradition
at W&L based on the support of a
majority of the students.

The only way these goals can be
achieved is for each individual mem-
ber of the E.C. to recognize his re-
sponsibility to the Student Body.
This I will try to do.

In my three years as a student at
Washington and Lee I have seen
various styles of dress. However, I
strongly support and wish to main-
tain only one style, that of conven-
tional dress as defined within the
ideal of a Washington and Lee gen-
tleman. I do realize that a majority
of our student body, while support-
ing this opposes the present means to
implement, or rather, enforce it. I
agree that a judicious change here is

Leadership Forum

I feel that the present system of
communication between the Execu-
tive Committee and the Student
Body inadequate. Controversies
seem to arise, but soon succumb to
“protest limbo.” I am hoping that
the ODK Leadership Forum, com-
posed of the fraternity house pres-
idents, and representatives from the
Independent Union, and the various
clubs and organizations on campus
will act as a sounding board for
any questions, problems, or contro-
versies that arise on compus. This
forum, as a committee of effective
total representation, would investi-
gate, study and submit recommenda-
tions to the Executive Committee for
further action.

Political System

I am a nominee of the University
Party. Yet I also remind you that
I am seeking your support as an
individual candidate.

I believe in a party system of pol-
ities as I ean not conceive of poli-
ties existing without parties, associa-
tions, clubs, or whatever one chooses
to eall them. However, I do feel the
present structure needs revision, |
believe the idea of open primaries
is sound. However, I do feel that

Lee Hits Honor System

sideration which must undergo our
scrutiny. The recent school wide re-
ferendum on conventional dress, in
which some 60 per cent of the stu-
dent body registered some sort of
disapproval, was subject to the worst
sort of political chicanery. The E.C.
at first refused even to set up a sub-
committee to analyze the results, and
the student body was led to believe
that the apathy in voting was a
mandate for the status quo. Conven-
tional dress ought to be maintained
at Washington and Lee, but let us
concern ourselves not with the let-

 

eames

 

 

ter of conventional dress but with
the spirit. Our concern ought to be
that of keeping the campus neat
and not of enforcing convetnional
dress in the town of Lexington when
it is often inconvenient to the indi-
vidual student. If petty violations
were to go unreported, would it not
in fact strengthen student support
of conventional dress? And would it
not permit a little more individual
freedom for those who find it diffi-
cult to adhere to the letter of the
dress code? What I seek is to
strengthen conventional dress, not to
see continued discredit brought to
bear upon it. We might even in the
near future establish a test period in
which the activities of the Assimila-
tion Committee would be suspended
to see if we can maintain conven-
tional dress without punitive sup-
ervision. If ‘this failed, I would
strongly recommend reverting back
to the present situation.

It has become more and more ob-
vious here at W&L that there is a
serious leadership vacuum. Even the
administration, which has within its
powers the authority to initiate
change, has failed pitifully to rec-
ommend changes where they are
needed. The only other agency on,
campus which can assume the ini-
tiative is the E.C. and up until now
it has demonstrated that it lacks the
will to do so. I think the time has
come when we can no longer toler-
ate this. We must not elect another
E.C. which ignores or fails to articu-
late student demands. The use of
referendums and petitions to the ad-
ministration are only two possible
ways in which the E.C. can articulate
and dramatize student dissatisfaction
and protest. Why it has failed to do
this is beyond my comprehension.

attend a meeting of the Executive
Committee. This will be a further
deterrent to student apathy in re-
gard to campus government, and it
will help modify the impression of
mysterious elitism which often sur-

 

rounds the Executive Committee.

I wholeheartedly believe in and
support the Honor System, and I feel
that at such time as a student vio-
lates the trust placed in him by this
University he has servered his con-
nection with it. I do not wish to see
the Honor System eliminated from
discussion, however; this I encour-
age.

It has been suggested that the
principle of consesus should be the
underlying determinant of student
government. I agree that in most
areas this would apply. However, I
strongly discourage the advocation
of consensus as panacea for all
actions. The expression of student
opinion is often ambiguous, as in
the case of the recent Assimilation
Committee referendum, and I would
suggest that in some significant areas
a reliance on consesus would only
lead to indecisive student govern-
ment,

Finally, to assert a leadership gap
in our student government is all
too easy an approach. I think that
such leadership is inadequate if it
does not question, if it does not ex-
amine, if it does not realize the need
for constructive improvement in both
general and specific sense—in short,
if it is complacent. If I am elected
President of the Student Body, I
promise that complacency will be as
nonexistent as I can make it.

Membership
Referendum
Wins 790-243

By an overwhelming majority, the
student body in yesterday's election
voted in favor of the proposed |
change in the EC representation
with regard to the Law School and
undergraduate groups. However,
the EC-sponsored referendum aimed
at bringing the operations of estab-
lished political parties into the open
for equal participation by all fac-
tions failed to receive the necessary
majority vote and was thus defeated.

The referendum to change the
EC membership to give a greater
representation to the sophomore class
of the undergraduate school was
approved by 790 students as opposed
to only 243 against it. As a result of
this voting, the two EC members of
the Intermediate and Senior Law
Classes will be combined, with the
other place being allocated to the
Sophomore Class. The EC total mem-
bership will still remain at 10 but] ~
now the sophomores will have two
representatives and the Law School
two.

This change was proposed by the
EC late this winter after a discussion
in January regarding the dispropor-
tionately large voice held by law
students in determining what are
mostly undergraduate affairs. For-
merly the Law School had nearly
one-third of EBC membership while
holding only 13 per cent of student
body membership.

In the other major referendum
vote, the student body flatly rejected
a plea by the EC to force campus
political parties to 1) register with
the EC, 2) report a list of all ex-
penditures to the EC for approval,
and 3) hold open attendance and
nomination primaries.

Although the vote itself was passed
by 538 to 483, it failed te achieve
the majority vote of 618 required
by EC ruling.

Commenting on the student body's
rejection of this proposed detriment
to what some call “clique” politics
controlling student elections, Univer-
sity Party president James Jennings
had this to say: “Aidmittedly campus
polities as it exists now is in a de-
plorable state, and a positive effort
should be made to correet the situa-
tion in the near future. However, as
evidenced by the results of student
balloting, the proposal put forth by
the EC was obviously not the right
answer.”

Uncle Som Chooses Six Seniors For Peace Corps

To Be Sacrificed In Turkey, Peru And Tanzania

By MIKE DUNN
Associate Editor

Why join the Peace Cerps?
“There's lot of idealism to it;”
-unsure about graduate school;”

“I wanted to see a way of living
different from a Southern small
town,” are some of the answers. Dr.
Milton C. Colvin, Peace Corps liaison
officer at W&L, describes it as having
just being a “young, energetic, ideal-
istic, and enthusiastic young Amer-
ican.”

Six seniors at Washington and Lee
have been notified by the Peace
Corps that they have been tentative-
ly accepted for service overseas.
Three of them, Ken Marion, Bill
Surbaugh, and Phil Siffling, are be-
ing sent to Turkey; while the re-
maining three, Andy Kilpatrick, Pete
Graeff, and Maleolm Morris, will go
to India, Peru, and Tanzania, respee-
tively.

Following graduation in June, each
student will attend a 40-60 day in-
tensive training peried intended to
provide basic understanding of the
language, customs, history, and eco-
nomie conditions of the country to
which each will go, as well as to
further test the student's ability to
live and work well with others. This
will be followed by on-the-spot
training in the host country.

Each of the six presently expects
to eventually teach at a primary 01
secondary level in the schools of the
eountry te which he is sent. What
they may actually end up doing

is practically no salary—you may
save up about $1,000 in a two-year
period of constatnt and difficult
work. In addition, volunteers live
among the local population, eating
the same food, living in the same
kind of housing, all of which is of-
ten totally different from the food
and housing to which they have
been accustomed.

Four other seniors are now await-
ing their notices of acceptance or
rejection. These will be notified by
the end of the semester. In addition,
over a dozen juniors have also indi-
cated an interest in the Peace Corps,
and will be eligible to apply next
year.

Dr. Colvin noted that W&L is only
reflecting a quickened interest in the
Peace Corps which extends all over
the country Haverford College, for

example, recently found that as many
of its graduating seniors went into
the Peace Corps as went into busi-
ness. “There are presently 7,000 vol-
unteers in the field, and 1,000 in the
pipeline,” he said. “The Peace Corps
hopes to have 10,000 in the field by
the end of this year.”

In recognition of this growing in-
terest, arrangements have been made
for two Peace Corps workers to visit
the school within the next few weeks.
On April 26, Peggy McNally, a grad-
uate of Duke University, will speak
on her work as an English teacher
in Costa Riea and the Philippines,
while on May 6, Mr. Stephen Giuld,
an alumnus of the class of 1963 at
W&L, and presently a recruiter with
the Peace Corps headquarters, will
speak about his experiences in Sierra

‘Why Are You Crying?

One week he is reluctantly feted in At-
lanta as the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize,
and the next week he sits in a jail cell in Sel-
ma, Alabama.

Five years ago, it was a spot which was
hard to find on a map; today it is the location
of a war that is highly consequential in nature,
and yet at the same time has been termed
“silly,” 1965’s Spanish-American War” and
“damn ridiculous.”

Martin Luther King, Jr. tried to register
to vote—tried to lead a group of those who at
least enjoy the right, if not the actuality, of
voting. And, in the true Southern traditional
sense, he and hundreds of others were not
only denied this right, but also a peaceable as-
sembly.

The headlines are full of it—South Viet-
nam has become the focal point of the world’s
attention. “A brush-fire war” has become a
symbol, a bleeding symbol, where two giants
oppose each other on territory not their own.
The native people are puppets in a fight not
their own. Ridiculous? Highly.

The phrase “man’s inhumanity to man”
has meant little until we view such blatant in-
justice and wide-eyed defiance of all that is
human.

Perhaps with the approaching Springs
Dance Set, complete with the driving sound
of Chuck Berry, this is not the time to put
forth a question of man’s decency, his value
system. Maybe one should not be so naive as
to disturb the ritualistic joy of after-concert
outbursts and after-drinking bewilderment by
introducing such matters. After all, the stu-
dent says, we have pondered, crammed, burn-
ed the oil, have been sterile and scholarly ac-
cording to the catalog.

Now we deserve our period of forgetful-
ness and un-concern. The time is right for a
momentary stay against the pressures of theo-
ries and thinking. We need to drown the great
god Academia.

Now is the time, you say, to lay our minds
on a dusty shelf, amid the clutter of omnious
books and used 19¢ BIC’s. The mouth. . .
the ears .. . the eyes... the feet . . . the pel-
vis... the fingertips—these are Springs’ rul-
ers.

It will never work, College Man.

I see you when you arrive for the week-
end, you are already tired from your trip, but
you are lovely. You kiss me matter-of-factly,
but there is a promise in your eyes, and a
smile that longs to be smiled alone. At the
boardinghouse, Mrs. Wayland will take your
four dollars and let us know how glad she is
to see us again. She smiles on lovers.

I will show you our apartment, and I am
secretly proud when you tell me it looks sharp.
You will leave Chanel on the pillow, and I
will be sad on Sunday.

In Rochester, there was a little boy named
Sammy. He was a Negro. He would not speak,
except when he pulled on my sleeve and said,
“got a nickel?” His eyes were always half-
blank, half-questioning. I remember first meet-
ing him fighting with another child. I pulled
him away and picked him up. All he did was
open his mouth as wide as he could and utter
a silent scream. .. .

I carried him home on my back, and he
peed in his pants. On the front porch of his
house, his mother sat with her legs spread and
cleaned the meat out of the shell of a huge
turtle. The blood dripped off of the porch
onto the dusty ground where two near-naked
urchins played with another turtle shell. Sam-
my was crazy.

At the concert, you will wear your flower-
ed Villager blouse and your light blue A.
shaped skirt, and your hair will be long. We
will listen to the music muted by a thousand

intimate voices. Your eyes are bright, your
ear cold against my cheek. You look up with
wet, happy eyes and pass your lips—quietly,
softly—across my cheek. For a fleeting second
we are alone in the crowd, and I am filled with

wonder and with love.

The newspapers are filled with our guilt.
Birmingham, Jim Crow & Co. pride them-
selves on keeping order with fire-hoses and cat-
tle-prodders. Negroes are beaten, and the Klan
cheers. And still they come. “Keep your eyes
on the prize; hold on.” Philadelphia . . . The
three workers lie rotten in a shallow grave—
victims of fear and godless hatred. They will
not be tried for murder, not Rainey and Price.
“Life ’ runs a full-page photo of smiling Sher-
iff Rainey, his mouth full of “Red Man” chew-
ing tobacco. Little Rock seems so far away—a
long, bloody way away. Selma provides the
Washington Post headlines for two weeks.

Ain’t no black s.o.b. gonna stink up my

A single Negro looks into the mad crowd
of whites faces, they are ugly with fear and
hatred. “NIGGER,” they scream. His head
bows. “NIGGER! NIGGER! NIGGER!”

Response from Peking and now Hanoi to

the President’s speech indicate both Commu-
nist capitals have carefully examined Mr.
Johnson’s remarks and found in them no ba-
sis for negotiation. Communist China dramati-
cally underlined her no-negotiation posture on
the Vietnam war yesterday by slamming the
door in the face of would-be emissairies from
the United Nations and Great Britain. Power
plays within the South Vietnamese military
command today seemed to be gaining the kind
of momentum that has led to coups in the
past. .

They lay very still on the blanket. In the
distance they could hear the gaity and laughter
of a party. The moon’s hazy brilliance cast a
pale blue light through the thick pines, inter-
rupted only by an occasional strand of silken
cloud.

The | Election

Election time has come—and gone. Of-
ficers change but W&L’s lethargic attitude to-
wards elections, and more importantly to the
officers the students elect, continues as one of
the school’s most despicable conventions.

However much was heard about the Hon-
or System during the campaign, once again
an honorable election was stymied. It appears
that an effective, but untrue, rumor was cir-
culated in the Law School. “The Honor Sys-
tem here at W&L has as its primary reason

Flash! Politicians are exempt from the de-
mands of honor for a week.
This year the student body was offered a
distinctive choice in all three contests. This
campaign was not a battle of “I’m more status

quo, or I'm more conservative than my op-

for

ponent.” In the past the far, far right has
been a very crowded place during election
week. Last year, the far right won by a com
fortable margin; this year the moderate posi
tion won by the same margin.

The Ring-tum Phi extends its congratula
tions to Joe Frampton, Dave Marchese, and
particularly to Fred Mindel, who won without
benefit of an organized party or coerced vot
ers. Congratulations, particularly to you, Fred,
because you won because you are Fred Min.

The campaign was characterized by a pro

Needed Improvement

 

By KEN McGRAW

It seems utterly inconsistent that
the University should sponser stu-
dent activities on the Friday night
of Springs and Openings and yet re-
quire class attendance on the follow-
ing day. The present two-faced ap-
pearance that the University has on
this matter is an apparent attempt
to be both liberal and strict at the
same thing. On the one hand is the
smiling face which condones all the
desires of a young man’s fancy and
on the other is the stoical and staid
face that we associate with the man
who wrote the Blue Laws. The Uni-
versity should say either “no”

It is apparent from the results of
yesterday's Student Body elections
that at least a partial revolution is
taking place at Washington and Lee
in the areas of student politics and
government. This revolution was
most apparent in the election of Fred
Mindel to the office of President of
the Student Body.

The Revolution to which I allude
is two-fold in nature. First, the stu-

Abolish Saturday closses. What Saturday classes?

“yes” to Openings and Springs week-|
ends, Springs being our primary|
concern at the moment. |

We tread lightly here for fear}
that the answer would be “no” and
that Springs weekend would be cut
to a one-day affair. Perhaps this is
a matter which should be left alone
when you consider ‘the University’s
alternative to eliminating Saturday
classes during dance sets which
would be eliminating the weekend.

either unlimited cuts or have saved)

A faculty poll on the question
of whether or not there should
be Saturday classes over Springs
was taken this past week. Of

a constructive role in student af-

of the clique by the students will
probably enable the truly positive
and responsible individuals in the
party to rid itself of self-seeking
hangers-on.

The second aspect of this revo-
lution in student affairs is more
positive than the repudiation of old
political forms. This second factor
is the phenomena of a truly issue
oriented platform of the type pre-
sented by Fred Mindel. In support-
Mr. Mindel, the students have
made clear their desire to assume
a greater role in student govern-
ment and their desire to see their
representatives take a larger part

Generals Lose Again

On 8th Inning Walks

By LOCK HANDLEY

W&L’s baseball team finally got
within hailing distance of a win
Tuesday. They led touring Castleton
State 9-5 going into the eighth. The
hitters had finally started hitting,
the fielders had been fielding suc-
cessfully, and starting pitcher Jim
Cooper had been generally effective
though somewhat wild.

Then things started to happen.

Cooper, who had used a total of
155 pitches in going seven, tired and
filled the bases with one run in and
nobody out. Coach Joe Lyles brought
in sinkerball Pete Heumann to try
for the double play, and Heumann,
who has yet to show the form he
displayed last year as a freshman,
gave up six more runs in retiring
two men. Southpaw Chris Wigert
was no more effective, walking both
men he faced, and freshman Bill
Rasmussen walked in another run
before getting the final out.

That was the thirteenth run for
Castleton; and that was the way it
wound up,

Except for that one disastrous in-
ning, however, the Generals looked
better than they had all year. They
scored runs in four different innings,
jumping off to a lead in the first
inning on a walk to Ashley Allen and
singles by Dave Kirkpatrick and Eric
Sisler, In the third, Tom Crenshaw’s
homer scored Allen, on base with
another walk. W&L added another
run in the same inning as Skip
Chase doubled, stole third, and came
home on Luke Crosland’s single.

In the fourth, a double by pitcher
Cooper and back-to-back singles by
Kirkpatrick, Allen, and Crenshaw
accounted for three more tallies. The
final General runs came in the sixth
on two Castleton errors and a single
by Crenshaw.

All told the team collected thir-
teen hits, one less than the visitors’
total. Crenshaw led W&L, going
three for four and driving in four
runs. Crosland also got three hits
for the Generals and Kirkpatrick
contributed two.

Coach Lyles was particularly en-
couraged by his squad’s base running,
which has been notably deficient in

Ah, beautiful spring again, that
time of year when sports editors

that, but it wouldn’t be traditional.
So, for better or for worse, here goes.

Trackmen
Beat High
Point, 83-62

By JOHN GRAHAM

It’s a new season for the Washing-
ton and Lee track team.

The Generals, after dropping their
first two meets of the outdoor season,
defeated Hampden-Sydney last week
and High Point on Tuesday to even
the season ledger at 2-2.

Using a juggled lineup, the cinder-
men captured nine of 17 events,
sweeping the pole vault and the 880
to down High Point 83-62. The field
events proved to be the Generals’
strongest point, as they won four of
seven, taking second in the other
three.

Manson Wins

Dan Manson won the shot put with
a heave of 43'4”, Rick Mynttinen
took the javelin with a 165’8” throw,
Rich Hartgrove tied for first in the
high jump with a 5’8” leap, and John
Graham, John Lawrence and Rick
Rogers swept the pole vault.

The 440 yard relay team of Chris
Kell, Bob Bigham, Spencer Sulli-
van and Rob Orr led off the running
events, winning in :45.1. Kell won the
100 in :10.3, Bigham took the 440
in :52.0, and Sullivan captured the

last season to win the pennant in!
a six-team race. Defending champ-|

start they have gotten off to, should
be able to take second.

Stickmen Face Cantoneville Next;

Swan Sees Tough, Even Game

Described as “a real tough team”
by coach Dana Swan, the Catons-
ville Lacrosse Club of Catonsville,
Maryland, will face the Washington
and Lee Generals in a game here
tomorrow.

Coach Swan sees W&L's chances
“as even” for the game set to begin
at 2 pam. at Wilson Field. The Mary-
land club is an experienced outfit
composed of players who in many
eases played their college career
at Maryland and Johns Hopkins.
They are reportedly leaded with
talent.

With their experience and talent
the Maryland club is the type of
team that can explode on a moment's
notice and turn a close contest into
a runaway. They seldom fail to take
advantages of their opponents mis-
takes.

Swarthmore, a one-goal conquerer
of the Generals in a practice game
earlier this season, holds a 14-9 de-

 

cision over Catonsville. However, this!

gether. Their midfield is also tough
with Towson’s former all-leaguer
Crispino helping to anchor this
position.

The Generals came out of their last
weekend's encounters with New
Hampshire and Hartwick in relative-
ly good shape. Several minor injuries
were incurred, but none serious
enough to prevent any players from
seeing action tomorrow. Billy An-
drews, who was knocked out against
New Hampshire in the most specta-
cular injury last week, returned for
practice Wednesday and will also be
ready for tomorrow's game.

This past week the Generals em-
phasized riding and clearing in prac-
tice, having apparently cleared up
some of their shooting difficulties
last week. W&L scored 19 goals in
the two games.

Coach Swan refused to make any
predictions on tomorrow's game, say-
in only that the Generals can win it
if they hustle, play soundly, keep

Honors As Golfers Tie

“It couldn't be much closer.” That's
what golf coach E. P. “Cy” Twombly
said after his team opened the sea-
son with a 4!2-4'2 tie match against
Hampden-Sydney’s Tigers.

Leading the way for the Generals
was captain Ed Crosland who was
medalist for the day with a 77. He
opened the meet with a 6-5 victory
over the Tiger’s Jim Councill. In the
other half of that foursome, Tom
Richardson took the measure of Bob
Duckwall, one-up. Duckwall card-
ed an 81, The Generals took the best
ball, 4-3.

In the second foursome, W&L’s
Dick Drew carded an 80 and was a
3-2 victor over Bill Beckner of
Hampden-Sydney. Jim Duke then
evened the series for the Tigers as
he downed Roger Sennott, one-up.
The best ball was halved.

Hampden-Sydney tied the match
on the third and final foursome. The
Tiger's Thompson was a 5-4 victor
over Dave Carroll. Jim Fulwider of
W&L countered with an 81 and a
3-2 victory over Bob Tuck. But
Hampden-Sydney took the best ball
one-up to tie the match at 44-44.

W&L this afternoon traveled
Ingleside golf club in Staunton for
a match with Bridgewater. On Mon-
day W&L will be at the Lexington
Golf Club for a match with Old Do-
minion. This could be a tough match
as coach Twombly rates ODC one
of the toughest golf teams in the
state.

baseman Scott Lavery.

by pitcher Bruce Kramer and the|
heavy hitting of Mare Winston. The
Sigma Chi’s scored only in the first:

out the game. The Sigma Chi’s had
just come from a 26-12 thrashing at
the hands of the Phi Delts the Day
before.

League C was the scene of a pro-
test resulting from the Beta Theta
Pi game with the DU’s. The final
score was 12-11 in favor of the Beta’s,
however DU is protesting a call that
came in the last inning with two
men on base. DU runner Frank Jones
was called out for running the wrong
way after crossing first. The play
ended the ball game.

On Wednesday, Phi Ep was able
to edge the Betas 14-13 led by the
pitching of Maurice Fliess. Larry

The Troubadour Theater's
and final production of the
Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Jour-
ney inte Night, will open on Wed-
nesday, May 5th and run through
Saturday, May 8th.

Long Day's Journey into Night
was written in 1940, but never pro-
duced until after the author's death
in 1956. O'Neill would not allow the
production during his lifetime be-
cause it is a strangely biographical
play. It deals with many incidents
from his own life young man
and the misery of his family.

only the subject matter. “The play
has far more importance,” Dr.

Plans were finalized last eve-
ning by the Executive Com-
mittee for the presentation of a
Mock Honor Trial. The trial
is tentatively set for May 5 in

Lee Chapel at 7 p.m. Attend-
ance will be voluntary although all
freshmen are particularly urged to
attend in order to complete their
orientation program.

A subcommittee under the direc-
tion of Jim DeYoung composed the
script which incorporates all the ele-
ments of an actual trial situation.
The EC decided to withhold the na-
ture of the verdict in an effort to
lend a certain amount of credence to
performance of the trial.

The parts of the witnesses and de-
fendant will be played by former
members of the EC while the pres-
ent BC will constitute the Honor
Court in this fabricated incident. A
rehearsal of the trial has been sched-
uled for next week at which time
the entire production will be re-
viewed by the Committee.

Overcut Problem

Malcolm Morris, chairman of a
subcommittee dealing with the over-

}cut problem, reported that his com-

mittee plans to offer several alter-
natives to the Self Study Committee
in the area of punishment for an
overcut.

Some of the suggestions which
will be put before this faculty com-
mittee include the following: A re-
duction in credits (both quantity and
quality) for an unexeused overcut,
or possibly a reduction in the stu-
dents grades (not to fall below D).
In adidtion, some restrictions on the
student's cuts for the next semester
or even increased assignments in the
particular course could serve as an
adequate disciplinary measure.

In the case of semester seniors
Morris proposed that all students in
this category who have a graduating
average be given three weeks of
cuts. Morris felt that this would ef-
fectively eliminate the problem of
overcutting by second semester sen-
iors.

Class Elections

In other action the EC set Mon-

day, May 3 as the date for class
elections. The location of class meet-
ings will be announced at a later

A Spot of Enthusiasm

The outstanding performance of the W&L debate team

at Randolph-Macon College a

t Ashland last weekend again

brings attention to a group which has deserved attention all

year long. In a tournament which attracted the best schools
from Virginia and the surrounding area, Washington and Lee
debaters swept the majority of the honors. So far this year
the debate team has accumulated ten trophies—despite the fact
that most of the debating has been done by freshmen.

This year was supposed to be a building year for the de-
bate program, and so “participation” was stressed even more
than usual, and a large number of freshmen in particular were
used in major tournaments. Working without any kind of
academic credit, the novices put in enough time at debating to
be able to compete on a level with experienced college debat-
ers in most meets.

Certainly debating is one area where W&L’s notorious
“apathy” has not struck. It is real enthusiasm for debating
which has made Washington and Lee’s debate program prob-
ably the best in the state and definitely one of the top in the
east. And that debating is a valuable experience is proven by
the fact that in each of the last four years one of three student
body officers on the E. C. has been a man with extensive de-

Saunders Analyzes “Big Four” Election Returns

 

Party Strength Defeated Reform Proposals

By STEVE SAUNDERS
Associate Editor

A easual look at the returns from
any political race indicates merely
that one man lost and another won.
But a closer perusal of the available
figures can reveal a great deal about
what happened, what will happen,
and — more importantly — why.

Lower Turnout

Only 1067 students voted last
Thursday out of a total enrollment
of approximately 1250. This com-
prises 84% of the Student Body. Last
year, 98% of the Student Body voted;
1126 voting out of a student body of
approximately 1150. Clearly, not as
much interest was generated during
the 65 campaign as there was last
year.

The campaign of themselves were
not in any way easy-going. In both
the Mindel-Walker and Marchese-
Lee races the campaigning was brisk.
Forensic Union and Independent Un-
ion speeches added color. But it was
a pivotal point in W&L political an-
nals, because straight party voting
broke down and split tickets carried
the day. This splitting resulted in
Mindel’s victory.

The presidential contest drew more
voter attention than the other races.
Out of 1067 voting in the presidential
race, nine did not vote for a vice-
president; thirty-four did not vote
for secretary, and one hundred seven
(107) did not vote for Fancy Dress
President.

Constitutional amendments. did

 

two years ago.

 

attract voters with 1043 voting on

the EC Reapportionment Amendment
(Number I) and 1021 voting on the
Political Reform Amendment (Num-
ber II).

Low, or lower, turnouts can usual-
ly be ascribed in contemporary Am-
erican politics to a variety of
causes: rain (the farmers stay home),
cold (the city people stay home),
snow (everybody stays home), a poor
campaign (the candidate stays home),
or poor newspaper and media cover-
age (nobody knows there’s an elec-
tion).

Tired of Politics

However, W&L votes few farmers,
no city dwellers, had no snow on
April 15, and enjoyed extensive cov-
erage of the campaign in the Ring-
tum Phi. But still the interest was
lacking. Many students were tired
of politics, tired of party switches,
weary of clique talk, annoyed by the
noise of candidates. And so 26% of
them — one hundred twenty-four —
stayed home.

Miller Successful

Joe Miller, successful candidate for
Fancy Dress President, was in an
especially difficult situation; he was
unopposed. This may be hard for
anyone not in a like circumstance to
understand.

Miller had to present a campaign,
and act like a candidate. However,
in a nation where the essence of
elections is contrast, and appeal on
the basis of opposition (for there is
a great deal to be said for negativ-
ism in a campaign), Miller had no-
body with whom to contrast and

 

Overcut Penalty Absurd

Cut System Is Called

 

By BIFF BARKER

Nestled in the Shenandoah Valley,
Washington and Lee has retained a

number of quaint
) old customs. Take
| our cut system, for
) example.

There was a time
when W&L was a
* school for rich
 , Southern playboys
_ Parents sent their
children there to
get a good educa-
tion, but also to
have a good time.
It didn’t really
matter how much hell they raised
juts so long as they got those gen-
tleman “C's”, Perhaps then it made
sense to require students to go to

  
 

last year’s entering class at Williams
and Pomona, according to the Hand-
book of College Profiles.

For better or for worse, the W&L
man today is of a more intellectual,
more serious breed. To burden him
with regulations which applied to a
far different type of person one or
two generations ago is insulting.

It is insulting that the W&L man
who measures up to today’s high
standards should be considered too
irresponsible, too incapable to handle
his own education. We have come to
one of the finest universities in the
South, and yet we are treated as if
we were in high school.

Some people have attacked out cut
system. They think it should be
liberalized. They thinks the “F”
|penalty for overcutting is too strict.

 

“Quaint Old Custom”

|that a majority of the student body

cuts, or worse yet, because he can't
let all those good unused cuts go to
waste. Is this a mature outlook? Is
this the kind of man Washington and
Lee wants to develop? That is why
the cut system must go. This
“hooky” complex must be overcome.

But let’s be realistic for a minute.
What would happen if the cut sys-
tem were abolished? It is possible
that the place would go wild. Per-
haps it would be Goshen every day,
and the camps would eb on ehuge
tomb—for a week or two.

A few years back an experiment
was run. Second semester seniors
were given unlimited cuts. The re-
sults were not exactly encouraging.
Naturally the seniors acted like chil-
dren let loose in a pastry shop! They
had been treated like children for
three and a half years!

would be able to accept the awesome
burden of unlimited responsibility
without evacuating Lexington in the
first place.

Like most needed reforms which

too long have been prolonged, there
is a risk that change might bring

nothing to oppose.

The Students appreciated Miller's
concern for their votes — even
though he was unopposed — and so
gave them to him. Miller polled 748
votes. He needed only 480 to win.
“Fritz” received 212 votes.

Party Defeats Reform

It seems strange that the Political
Reform proposal, which received 68%
of the 500 votes cast a few weeks
ago, failed again on Thursday with
only 52% of the 1021 votes cast. It
is hard to believe that a proposal
favored by a majority of the stu-
dents who originally voted on it could
spontaneously excite opposition to
the tune of 483 “No” votes within
three weeks.

No student leader publicly opposed
it; no candidate publicly attacked it;
no faction was in loud opposition.
But nonetheless it was defeated by a
quick but effective campaign by
those who did not want to see the
amendment pass.

The responsibility cannot be logi-
cally pinned on anyone, but is an in-
dication of latent strength from some
corner.

Popular speculation has it that the
University Party is “washed up”, or
“breaking up”. The loss of the presi-
dency of the Student Body seems a
catastrophic blow. However, the
party will still be a force with which
to reckon. ;

Although the credit, or blame, for
the Political Reform Amendment's
defeat cannot be assigned to the
Party on the basis of the vote totals,
it may be assumed — purely sub-
jectively — that it was the influence
and holding power of the University
Party. This power is potent, and if
it held for the voting on amend-
ments it might hold on the faceless
voting for class officers.

Method of Victory

Mindel beat Walker on the basis
of dynamic personal appeal. The
party lost the claim it had on the
loyalties of its member houses be-
cause of the strength of this appeal.
Marchese defeated Lee more on is-
sues — that of modification of the
Honor System — than on personal
appeal; witness Lee’s 502 votes to

Columnist Tyler Voices Doubts About ‘New Guard’;
Says Elections Not Mandate For Sweeping Changes

By ROY TYLER
Tuesday Columnist

“The King is dead' Long live the
King!”

Washington and Lee has new pulled
itself out of the depths of darkness in
which is has been engulfed for sev-
eral generations,

This time it was the student body,
not the administration, which tock the
areatest step forward on campus since
the removal of Traveller's bones from
Lee Chapel. The New Guard has tri-

umphed!

I have heard cries of self-appoint -
ed rebel leaders that victory is
theirs; the elections proved that
Washington and Lee can now pro-
gress. | have also heard suggestions
that Lee College be built and the
New Guard be sent there, A very
interesting proposal, | must admit,

But te these whe try to understand
what happened on campus, the situa-
tion is a little bit different, First, just
what did happen during the elections
and second, what does it mean?

The oniy thing that one ean safely
say about the election is that it was
unorthodex. Anything else would be
pure guess work, Those whe say that
the election proved that the old guard
ia through are wrong. If this i true,

what about the two other party can-
didates who were elected in contested
races (omitting good old Fritz.)

The election was not a mandate

the conception of an entirely new,

radical point of view no more than

it was a triumph of good over evil,

The primary concern of the election,
omitting the personalities involved and
the big protest that was supposed to
be an issue, was the honor system. The
party candidate for president spoke
earnestly for maintaining the honor
system as it now stands

The independent candidate for pres-
ident also spoke in favor of the honor
system as it now stands, but murmur-
ings of suspicision were heard on
eampus that he was saying this be-
cause the majority of the students
were in favor of the system as it now
stands.

As | understand it the president-
elect does favor the system as it now
stands. He has spoken fer upholding
both the procedures and the penalties
now in effect and I personally believe
he is sincere in this belief. But, to
these who feel that the election should
mean a change in this system, I sug-
gest that they consider the situation
further

First, the honor system has work-

 

for an end to all traditions nor for |

| ed It has worked in the past and is
are reading this column, Without at-

| tions en campus,

exactly what

| “...@ gentleman does not lie, cheat,

| or steal,”

| He was sincere in his belief and he

| was not about to compromise about
honer.

Surely he did not believe that his
statement eliminated dishonor on cam-
pus. I am certain he realized that
cheating would probably oceur; but if
the Honor System kept one person
from being dishonest who normally
would have been, it was a success

But. what of the penalty? Is it
“right” for a person's life to be
“ruined” because of one moment's in-
discretion’ But, can it actually be clas-
sified as “one moment's indiscretion?”
A person lies, cheats, or steals... he
either does or he doesn't, If he does he
is not wanted as a student at Wash-
ington and Lee. He can go elsewhere
if he wishes, and I suggest this.

There have been several students
who have left this school, and other
schools, on an honor violation, and
have heen able to continue their edu

How curious! The Africans, the In-
dians in America, the Indians in In-
dia, and other peoples have for cen-
turies been regarded by us as
strange, fringe sorts of creature, en-
countered by us and used by us as
our western civilization spread.

And we have always won. When
has a sizeable group of Caucasians
been long subjected to Negroid or
Mongoloid peoples?

There are three great traditions in
our heritage: The Greek, from which
we still have the notion of arete or
individual excellence; the Roman,
whence we derive our ideas of or-
der and harmony in the state; and
the Judaeo-Christian, which gives us
concepts for the dealing with other
persons in a group.

The first of these shows the self in
relation to itself: what is a man as
an individual and what should he do
as such’ The position of the self,
what it means to be an individual
was explicated for us here recently
by George Sehrader, Yale Professor
of Philosophy, in his talk “The Exis-
tential Image of Man.”

Yet to be fully a man, one must
see himself not only in relation to
his self, alone and isolated from
others and the world—but also in
relation to other persons and to the
social natural world. Now our ideas
of law and of the relationship be-
tween man and the state derive from
our Roman heritage. And from our
Christian tradition, we have the no-
tion of love for our fellow men: a
self relating in a meaningful and sla |
nifleant way with others, not as mass
men, but as particular persons, with-
in a social order

if these notions are seen distinctly,
and clearly and in proper perspec-
tive, one can here find a set of
theories to answer the philosophical
questions it has been the custom of
each of us to answer in our tradi-
tion since the Greeks: who am I?
what am I doing here? how should
I go about living my life?

Yet there are many strange and
powerful forces at work within our
tradition which threaten it, and
thereby everything we hold dear.
Some of the threats, | think, come
from an extreme emphasis on a par-
ticular aspect of our tradition.

For instance, extreme individual-
ism in a variety of forms, if it causes
the individual to isolate himself en-
tirely from his social order, can
bring about the dissolution of our
social institutions—and thereby of the
framework in which a person can
come to individual maturity.

On the other hand, the extreme
;of power concentration in the state,
with a corresponding imposing of
burdensome and fettering regulations
upon persons, could so hamper and
cramp individual growth, by remov-
ing the freedom necessary for it
(which necessarily includes the free-
dom to make mistakes and abandon
society), that the state could destroy
its own basis—namely, free, intelli-
gent, active persons dedicated to
maintain freedom for themselves and
their children through a functioning
social order

 

The problem is, can we keep these
extremes alive, not as separate and!
antagonistic parts of our society, but!
as existing strongly and with a dy-|

Frampton won on _ his personal
popularity, which is considerable, It
was virtually impossible for rival
candidate Neely Young to drag in
issues, try though he might. The
party’s strength was manifest, there-
fore, in no area but the Reform

Amendment. And there it was sur-
prising.
Influence Waning
Whether the party will last

through another election or even be
able to nominate class officers with-
out splitting, is somewhat doubtful
on the basis of the student body
elections. If the party members will
not support their nominees, the party
is in trouble. Party affiliation and
endorsement has increasingly become
more of a liability than an asset.
Those nominated by the party for
class office will have to run personal
and highly individual campaigns to
garner much-needed votes from
members of independent houses.
Party nominees, except in unusual
cases, will go into elections with two
strikes against them: massive defec-
tions in the party and an aroused
discontent outside of it.

The party will not disappear, but
its influence on students is waning.
Not one of the candidates presented
on April 15 won because of his party
backing, or lack of it. A new “gen-
eration” of W&L students is growing
up without having the party as the
ultimate in political life. The party
must face this, and reform from
within, or face ruin from without.

What's Next?

Defeated candidates for high of-
fice generally make splendid and
successful candidates for lower of-
fice — IF they were not defeated
too badly. By this standard, Bob
Lee will be a shoo-in for senior class
office, possibly one of the two EC
positions. Chuck Walker, by an-
other standard, seems likely to be
elected senior EC when the Party
nominates him — and they must
nominaté him if only to salvage
something from last Thursday setl
back. This turn of events will upset
many would-be candidates in the
party who now will be frozen out of
at least one of the Senior Class
nominations.

that we will not tolerate a state that
demands from us that we give up
our personal identity, while at the
same time we will devote part of our
energies to the maintenance of a
state in which free individuals can
flourish—grow, develop, and express
themselves.

But—what of the relationship of
our white western culture, faced thus
with its own internal problems, in
relation to the rest of the world? The
Negroid race has never been a threat,
and is now being absorbed into our
tradition.

But what of the Mongeloid race?
Does not this constitute one-half to
two-thirds of the world’s population?
And whe among us understands their
culture and history and ways of
thinking?

Russia belongs in our own tradi-
tion—and represents one extreme of
it. But what of China? Is there
anything in their culture and tradi-
tion which is compatible with ours?
Is there a basis for reconciliation?

And is it not contingent upon us, if
we understand our cultural heritage
and are to be true to it, to try to
face and understand those problems
clearly?

And must not each of us ask him-
self these questions: How ean I find
a better and happier life for myself?
What can I do to help reconcile
two conflicting social orders so that
all men can live together in some
form of harmony end without mutual
self-destruction? And—how can I
find a meaningful life with my close
friends and family?

This column is dedicated this week|
to one of W&L’s most unhearlded
athletes. His strength, endurance,
agility, and toughness had gone un-
recognized until last Saturday when
he gave a small crowd a display of
his fantastic athletic ability with a
performance that will long be re-
membered by the sparce collection
of spectators. Congratulations to
Jolly Girard for his display of amaz-
ing swimming ability.

Let’s look at the Indians objec-
tinvely. They have ten first rate big
league pitchers, eight of whom are
capable of going nine innings and
winning. The outfield is with Wag-
ner, Danalillo, and Colavito can
match the Yankees’ three in power
and average.

The infield has hitters and
ers, although second gaseman Larry
Brown is not a strong sticker. Jake

W&L Thumps Catonsville;
Klingelhofer Sparks Rout

The varsity lacrosse team, playing to an enthusiastic crowd,
won its second straight game on Wilson field Saturday, sound-
ly defeating an experienced Catonsville Club from Maryland,

16-5.

Caroll Klingelhofer played his finest game of the year,
scoring five goals and assisting on four more. The other Tri-

captains both contributed goals and*————

played well — Michaels with his ef-
fective ball control and feeding from
behind, and Robertson, who added
eight more ground balls to his im-
pressive season total of forty-three.
Freshman Tom Pittman was also
outstanding, as he netted two goals
and roamed all over the field, lead-
ing the team with ten ground balls.
The close defense of Gambill,
Stewart, and Bendann was tougher
than in previous games and account-
ed for fourteen ground balls. Lance
Bendann held Catonsville’s Hatch,
one of the best players in club le-
crosse, to a single goal. West was
magnificent in the nets and especial-
ly effective with his clearing, fre-
*quently dodging astounded Catons-
ville attackmen as he ran the ball
/to midfield. All players saw action
| for the second consecutive Saturday.

Catonsville opened the seoring
| soon after the opening whistle, but
| the Generals tied it on a beautiful
low shot by Robertson, fed by
| Klingelhofer, They effectively
| controlled the ball throughout the
quarter, as Klingelhofer tallied
twice and assisted on the fourth
goal. Although the Blue seemed to
have a safe lead after the first fif-
teen minutes of play, the visitors
narrowed the gap to 7-4 with
three scores in the second quarter.

The revitalized Generals rallied in
the third and final quarters as they
| continually frustrated the opponents’
| goalies, adding nine goals in the sec-
fond half. Klingelhofer placed his
ithird seore in his favorite upper
lright hand corner and followed with
jan to Bowersox, then tallied
lhis fourth goal on a_ blistering
i ground shot. In addition to his goal,
Bowersox had three assists and was

| outstanding defensively, as he shut
out Catonsville’ tough Fetteroff. The
Blues’ use of three mid-mields and
superior conditioning became evident
in the last period, as the vistors tired
and lost all momentum.

Coach Swan felt that the team
showed greater organization and
ability to work together than in
earlier encounters. The stickmen
worked well as a unit, and there is
a cohesive spirit among the players
as they prepare to enter the rough-
est games of the season. With
thirty-one goals in the two wins,
the squad has shown an offensive
punch and must continue to score
as the competition gets tougher.

Catonsville was an experienced
club, composed of the best stick
handlers the Generals have faced to

' date, yet the Generals took charge in

the second half and played their
game. The statistics clearly indicate
W&L’'s domination — the Blue out-
shot the visitors 52-22 and retrieved
72 ground balls to Catonsville’s 20.

|The extra man offense showed im-

provement, scoring on five of nine
opportunities, while the extra man
defense allowed but a single goal.

cation.” Their lives were not “ruined.”

They certainly had trouble and were
probably inconvenienced, but they
were guilty and had to pay. It’s as
simple as that.

Second, those who propose a one-
year suspension instead of dismissal
do not fully realize the implications of
their suggestion; or, if they do, they
disregard what would happen. Instead
of attempting to explain what could
take place, I will present a hypotheti-
cal situation,

If a student, knowing he will flunk
out if he receives an “F” in phys-
ics, writes five formulas on his palm
which will enable him to pass the
exam, he runs no additional risk
of being caught than if he fell under
the automatic rule. If he is caught
cheating he will be dismissed for a
year. If he fails his exam he will also
be dismissed for a year. In effect,
dishonesty would be put on the same
level with lack of academic achieve-
ment, Effectiveness?

Thirdly, to all who feel a more “hu-

manitarian” approach to the Honor
System should be taken, 1 propose
they study what effect this would have
on the system. I have seen a “humani-
tarian” system work. I have also seen
how students under this systems had
to lock their doors when they went to
take a shower. But, some have said
that no one would steal because we
have a “higher class” of students than
other school. I will relate this without
comment.

Even if we forget (which we can-
not) about things being stolen, what
about cheating? Do you want to take
an exam after studying eight or ten
hours, that someone has had in their
hands for several days? Or, would you

| be the one who had the exam before
it was given?
| Either way, you probably have
feelings on the matter. But I ask that
you consider the problem carefully.
Do not be duped by the idiots who
say that the election was a mandate
for “progress” and then classify prog-
ness” as changing the Honor System.
Those who feel this way are

wrong; wrong in a dangerous way.
They do not know what it is like to
feel the frustrations of working on
something only to see someone else
reap the rewards by cheating. When
they scream for change, I ask that
they think what it would be like in
five years or ten years.

It could happen here, very easily.

President-Elect
Thanks Helpers

Fred Mindel, president-elect of the
student body, promised today that
his “Active Representation” campaign
slogan would not be an “empty cam-
paign phrase” and that he would make
every effort to carry out the platform
which carried him to an upset over
the University Party last Friday.

Mindel issued the following state-
ment to the Ring-tum Phi this morn-
ing:

“IT wish to express my most sincere
thanks to all those students who dis-
confidence in me last
Thursday, especially those who work-
ed so long and so well in my behalf.
Without their loyal and dedicated ef-
forts, the outcome of last week’s vot-
ing might have been different.

“The results of the election consti-
tute not so much a mandate for an
individual as for an attitude. “Active
Representation” is not just an empty
campaign phrase, but a vital and prac-
tical method of leadership; a leader-
ship which actually and accurately
leads the student body, rather than
merely oversees it.

“This is our student government. |
It is your responsibility. And it is time |
for all of us to shoulder this respon-
| sibility. I not only invite, but expect, |

the important traditions which
Washington and Lee apart from all

of general student involvement, which |

Washington & Lee’s track team took |

some temporary adverse effects, but
it would also bring lasting and valu-
able results.

The responsibility for clas attend-
ance would pass out of the school-
master’s office and into the hands of
the student himself. Classroom at-
tendance would become a relation-
ship between the professor and the
student.

A student would still feel it
necessary to go to class, but no
longer because he was told. He
would know that few professors
tolerate a prolonged absence, and
he would know that he would be
missing something if he were ab-
sent,

This in practice students would
still ‘be compelled to attend class.
But the anti-intellectual approach of
a cut system would be gone. The
rule would no longer be the over-
riding reason to go to class.

The type of man at Washington
and Lee has changed in the past
years. The quality of education at
Washington and Lee has changed,
too. Now it is time to change the
attitude towards learning. It is time
to stop force feeding W&L students
their education.

What is the attitude of other uni-
versities towards class attendance?
Next week I will examine the situa-
tion of fourteen other universities.

The world premiere of portions of
an opera by two W&L professors
will be the featured point in a con-
cert of new music to be presented
Tuesday, April 27, at 8:00 p.m. in
Lee Chapel. The opera, entitled The
Curl, is the joint work of Professor
Robert Stewart and Dr. J. K. Shill-

soring the concert, spoke of the
opera as “very exciting — a most

The litthe old ladies in Richmond
have had their day in court—and they
lost.

The Virginia State Supreme Court
has struck a blow for liberty. Mon-
day they in effect outlawed the state's
right to censor movies. Taking into
account recent U.S. Supreme Court
decisions, the Virginia jurists ruled
that no longer do movies shown in
the state have to display that insidious
seal saying, “Approved by the Vir-
ginia State Board of Motion Picture
Censors.”

Ah, but the Court was generous. The
little old ladies in combat boots
haven't lost their jobs. They can still
give out seals of approval, it just
doesn't make any difference whether
the flick has it or not .

But they probably won't be so busy
now. They can fill up their time in-
stead with trips to wrestling and bex-
ing matches (Oh, those half-naked
men!), and we can attend good flicks
at the local emporiums.

Larkin Fowler, Chairman of the

to a great extent, on the student
body.”

Although conventional dress will
be required at Berry’s concert to-
night, it has been decided that for
the outdoor concert casual dress may
worn. This does not, however,
include any kind of shorts, although
slacks will be permitted for the girls.

In a lighthearted moment the

On May 10 the faculty will again meet to discuss the
present cut system and consider possible changes. In addi-
tion to a change in the penalty for overcuts, there seems to be
some hope that the cut system will be abolished entirely. The
Ring-tum Phi as representative of responsible student opinion,
strongly urges such a move.

Heumann Hurls No-Hitter; W&L Wins

Generals Win 2-1 on Bishop’s Run;
Lose Yesterday to Bridgewater

W&L’s baseball team does not win very many of their

games.

When they do win, though, they do it in style.
On Tuesday, for instance, sophomore righthander Pete

Heumann pitched a no-hitter

as the Generals beat RPI 2 to

1 in eleven innings for their first victory of the season.

The winning run came after Guy*———

Townley singled and was forced at
second by Luke Crosland. Ed Bish-
op ran for Crosland and promptly
stole second, Heumann walked, and
Larry Perrault singled to drive in
Bishop and wrap up the game.

Wildness was Heumann’s only
problem. He gave up a total of ten
walks, two of which, combined with
two wild pitches, gave the Rams
their run in the seventh inning. He
was also in deep trouble in the first,
walking the bases full with nobody
out, but the next man up struck out
and Ashley Allen’s great throw to
the plate on a long fly to right field
got Heumann out of the inning with
no score.

Except for those two innings, his
curve, which had not been effective
earlier this season, consistently cut
the corners of the plate and the RPI
batters got almost nothing to hit.
Only one spectacular catch, by short-
stop Dave Kirkpatrick on a looping
fly to short left field, was needed to
preserve the no-hitter.

The first W&L run came in the
sixth. Allen walked, took second on
a fielder’s choice, stole third and
came home on a single by Skip
Chase.

The Generals looked better in the
field than they had all year. Be-
sides the fine plays by Allen and
Kirkpatrick already mentioned, the
glovework throughout was excellent.
Only two errors were made, a sea-
son low.

Yesterday different story.
W&L reverted to its old form and
dropped its tenth game of the sea-
son to Bridgewater by a 17-1 score.
That figure outdid by one run the
former Generals low mark, a 16-1
loss to the same Bridgewater team.
The game itself was much the same
as the earlier debacle. The Generals
couldn't do anything right.

Was a

| Golfers Beat Bridgewater,
ODC; Record Now 2-0-1

With victories over Bridgewater
last Friday and Old Dominion on
Monday, the Washington and Lee
golf team now has a record of two
wins, no losses, and a tie.

The Generals golfers defeated the
Bridgewater golfers 8-1 in a match
at Ingleside in Staunton. The only
W&L loss in the match came when
Paul Hatcher, Bridgewater's top
golfer, defeated captain Ed Crosland,
one up.

Dick Drew took medalist honors in
the event as he carded a 76 and de-
feated Vince Gilmer, 7-6. W&L took
best ball honors in the first four-
some, one up.

In the second foursome, Jim Ful-
wider chalked up another W&L win
as he took the measure of Dave Ens-
wiler, 5-4. Fulwider had the sec-
ond best round of the day with a 77
Roger Sennott added another W&L
victory as he beat Dan Williams,
7-5. Best ball honors went to W&L,
6-5.

In the final foursome, Dave Carroll
was an 8-7 victor over Dick Ata-
miam, while Shad Rowe added a 79
and 9-8 victory over Mike Betts.
The best ball score was 9-8 for W&L.

Beat Old Dominion

On Monday the General golfers
were at the Lexington golf course
where they won a 5'2-3' decision
over highly-rated Old Dominion.

In the first foursome, Crosland
was a 4-3 victor over Tim Lyston|
and Drew took the measure of)
Glynn Rogers, two up. Crosland and)
Drew shared medalist honors for the}
day as each shot a 76. Surprisingly,|
Old Dominion took the best
honors, defeating W&L two up.

In the seeond foursome, both Old
Dominion’s Bob Truitt and Fulwider
shot 81's, but the Old Dominion golf-
er was a one up victor. Sennott
halved his match with Ken Grubbs!
and the best ball was also halved.

In the final foursome, Carroll and
Terry Emerson halved their match
while Rowe, with a 77, was a 4-2
winner over Tom Cotton. The best
ball went to W&L, 2-1

This afternoon ,the Generals trav-
eled to Hot Springs for one of the
toughest matches of the
against University of Virginia.

Defeat Lynchburg College, 77-59

Paced by Chris Kell
firsts Washington and Lee'‘s track
team downed Lynchburg College in
a meet there Tuesday afternoon by
a score of 77-59. For the Generals
it was their fourth win against two
losses.

Kell led a W&L sweep in the 100
yard dash, taking the event with a
time of :10.3. Then he added a victory
in the 220 with a time of :22.7. Kell
was also part of the winning 440 re-
lay team. It was a real close meet
going into the 100 yard dash, with
W&L leading 38-30. After the Gen-
eral sweep (Rob Orr coming in sec-
ond and Spencer Sullivan third) the
score was 47-30, and Lynchburg
never again got close.

feel it is) then this is the least we
can do.

The Chairman is fully convinced,
although he speaks for no one but
himself, that the fraternity system at
Washington and Lee has proved det-
rimental to the intellectual atmos-
phere at this university because it
tends to stifle enthusiasm for non-
social pursuits. It is evident to him
that fraternities at Washington and
Lee will cease to exist as fraternities
unless they themselves take action
in the near future to re-evaluate
their situation and correct its glaring
defects. It seems to the Steering
that the Interfraternity
Council is the logical body in which
this re-evaluation can take place, and

/in which constructive changes can

be initiated. It is our feeling that
CONTACT is an integral part of this
change for the better because it
is oriented in the right direction.
The Steering Committee will rec-
ommend to the Judicial Board of the
Inter-fraternity Council changes in
the structure and character of CON-
TACT will be given the chance to

serve, and that any suggestion, high-

jly critical or otherwise, will be
greatfully received.

A message of importance to sophomore men

if you've got what it takes
to be an Army Officer
you may qualify for this new

on-campus training program

A new Army ROTC program starts this

coming Summer for sophomore men who apply
prior to May 1—only 3,000 applicants to be accepted

If you're a sophomore now attending one of the 247 colleges and universities that
offer Army Officer training—or you plan to transfer to one of these schools next
Fall—you may qualify for the new two-year Army ROTC program.

This new program—designed especially for college men who have not taken
Army ROTC during their first two years— will commence with six weeks of
field training this coming Summer, beginning June 14. Then you'll have
on-campus training during your junior year . . . six additional weeks at camp
during the following Summer . . . and more on-campus training during your

senior year. Even flight training is offered at some schools.

campus life . . . extra spending money ($40 per month during your junior

and senior school years, and even more during Summer training) . . . and,

Resolution Asks

Faculty Reform
Cut Regulations

The student body Executive
Committee last night passed a
resolution to the faculty ask-
ing that changes be made in
the present absence rules.

The E.C. resolution, made
after the report of a subcommittes
headed by student body secretary
Malcolm Morris, expresses student
Opinion on possible courses of ac-
tion which will be considered by the
faculty at an upcoming faculty meet-
ing.

The resolution asks that the pres-
ent penalty of automatic failure for
a course
a student who overcut
will lose quality credits instead. The
loss of quality credits would not nec-

essarily be so severe as an automatic
“F,” and would not deprive the stu-
dent of satisfying a required course
merely for eutting.

In addition, the E.C. statement in-
cludes a clause asking that all sec-
ond semester seniors be given a
minimum of three weeks of cuts

Milne Case

Last night’s action by the Execu-
tive Committee is the end result of
a prolonged uproar over the
of a freshman, Charles Milne, who
received an “F” for an overcut last

Cast

month. Milne received a great deal
of attention when students put up
posters all over the campus asking
that his “F” be reversed

The Ring-tum Phi asked that the
penalty which caused Milne to re-
the “F” be changed,

Since Milne’s “F” penalty drew
much criticism, at least two student

"Nine Great Universities

Have No Cut Systems

 

By BIFF BARKER
Tuesday Columnist
Today, Washington and Lee stands

teetering on the
brink of  excel-
lence. The educa-

tion explosion has
caused Washington
and Lee’s academie
standards to soar,
This university
can't continue to
meet the chal-
lenge of a new era
still clinging to
outmoded meth-
ods.

Last week the deficiencies of our
present cut system were discussed.
I have written to the deans of a
number of schools, and today I will
examine the attendance require-
ments at these schools. First let's
look at five truly great universities,
Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Dartmouth,
and Princeton.

Harvard and Yale in general place
no attendance restrictions upon their
students. However, freshmen at

Yale must attend P. E.
the winter.

Harvard requires a student who
has had below a .75 average the pre-
vious semester to attend class, and
Yale requires students to go to class

classes during

who for two consecutive semesters
have received roughly the equiva-
lent in Washington and Lee terms
of an average below a 9. Also, pro-
fessors may lower the grades of
students who “flagrantly neglect”
class.

Stanford places no attendance re-
quirements upon its students. How-
ever, students still feel compelled to
come to class because they feel they
can't afford to miss what is going
on, and because they know a pro-
fessor may well lower their grade
for skimpy attendance.

Dr. Thaddeus Seymor, Dean of
Dartmouth College writes, “We
have no college wide policy con-
cerning absences. . . Some in-
structors (and departments) have
arbitrary cut limits, but in most
cases the tradition of a ‘limit’ is
fading fast.”

i is the situation at Prince-
ton? . Richard D. Challener, As-
i ig pe of the College, says,
“Princeton University no longer has
a centrally administered cut system.
The central recording of cuts was
given up seven or eight years ago
Responsibility for attendance is left
to individual members of the faculty
to handle as they determine.

“Some pay little attention to at-
tendance; others, however, establish

certain limits beyond which grades
are affected. A professor may, if he
wishes, report a student for over-
cutting to the dean’s office. In such
instances, we send a formal warning
letter and, on occasion, call the stu-
dent in for a discussion of his situa-
tion. But we do not act unless the
attendance problem is brought di-
rectly to our attention by the fac-
ulty member concerned.”

Five of the greatest universities in
the country, schools which it would
not hurt Washington and Lee to
emulate in many respects, have no
administrative cut system. They be-

lieve that their students can get
along all by themselves.
Small College Examples

Nevertheless, these are large uni-
versities, and some would argue that
they are not comparable to Wash-
ington and Lee. Let's look at four of
the best small schools in the country,
Amherst, Williams, Ponoma, and
Wesleyan.

Pomona College is considered by
most as the best small school in the
west. Here are some excerpts from
a long letter from Dr. Shelton L.
Beatty, Acting Dean of Students at
Pomona:

“The College states that every stu-
dent is ‘expected’ to attend classes,

laboratories, studies, ete. for which
he has enrolled. However, there is
no system of ‘cuts’ allowed or dis-
allowed, even before or after a va-
cation.

“This system works well. We
seek always to emphasize quality

W&L In Class With Slippery Rock, Southern Sem

and responsibility, and stu-
dents do take their job seriously as
a rule. Exceptions exist, but not
many.”

Wesleyan had a centrally adminis-
tered cut system until two years ago.
Now, however, students have un-
limited cuts. Until this year a rule
remained requiring students to at-
tend class before and after each
holiiday, but now that rule too has
been abolished

Dr. William L. Swartzbaugh, Asso-
ciate Dean of Amherst College sent
the following: “It is assumed students
will make the most of educational
opportunities available by regularly
attending classes and laboratory pe-
riods.

“At the beginning of each semes-
ter each instructor is free to state his
policy with regard to absence in his
course, and therefore he may report
to the Dean’s office the name of any
student who violates the announced
policy

Williams College has just rid itself
of an administrative cut system.
Writes Benjamin W. Labares, Dean

| Williams College, “As part of a
program giving each student a larg-
er share of responsibility for his own
education, Williams College no long-
er administers a general system of
required classroom attendance, as of
September, 1964.

“Although no formal system ol
class attendance is maintained by the
college, an instructor may set such
standards of attendance which he
feels are necessary for the satisfac-
tory conduct of his course. Students
who fail to meet these standards
ijmay be warned by the instructor
and notice sent to the Dean that
continued absence will result in their
being dropped from that course.”

We have looked at nine of the
finest universities in the country,
both large and small, and not one

of them forces its students to go to
class. The cut system at W&L to-

As I understand it, the proposed
one-year suspension is offered as an
alternative punishment for an honor

permanent expulsion.

‘
‘

Consider the example of a case in
which the violation was clearly
spontaneous or unpremeditated and
the person invelved would, beyond
reasonable doubt, benefit from a
suspension of one year. This is, I
suppose, what Mr. Tyler would
term “one moment's indiscretion”.

Mr. Tyler not only does not allow
this possibility but goes on to sug-|
gest that, quote, “A person lies,
eheats, or steals he either does
or he doesn't”. This is pure “fic-
tion” about the nature of Man.
Every man lies, cheats or steals
either to others or to himself

The principle of absolute hon-
esty which lies behind Mr. Tyl-
ers statement would convict of
guilt every person, for instance,
who has ever told someone else,

justify his action or to gain some
advantage from the other.

Win A Few
Lose A Few

By TOM CARPENTER

The biggest news in sports on the
Washington and Lee campus is the
no-hitter pitched by Pete Heumann
last Tuesday against Richmond Pro-
fessional Institute. This was the first
no-hitter by a W&L hurler in many
seasons.

Heumann also won the award for
the quote of the year. While
the Generals were batting late in
the game, Heumann was overheard
to say, “Not another Harvey Haddix,
fellows. Not another Harvey Had-
dix.” Haddix, as you probably know,
was the man who pitched a 12-inn-
ing perfect game only to lose in the
thirteenth on homerun by Joe
Adcock.

Actually Heumann’s comment was
somewhat inappropriate in that he
was not exactly hurling perfect
game. Pete had walked several bat-
ters and had also allowed one run.
He shuld have to Ken
Johnson, the Houston Astro pitcher,
who lost a no-hitter last year. But
Pete was referring to the extra inn-
ing aspect of Haddix’s defeat.

and Robertson added a solo tally to
the Generals a comfortable 8-1

The W&L stickmen did not let

Mike Michaels, whe played the

Pat Robertson had another phe-

Caroll Klingelhofer took only
eight shots but scored five and as-

was the fourth game in which
Klingelhofer has paced the team,

solid contender for All-American

both mid-field and attack, scored
twice. Bowersox played his usual

On the contrary, although the schools
mentioned here have hade provisions
to handle the few exceptions, they
nevertheless assume the best of their
students. Each of the schools as-
that its students are intelligent
enough to know they must attend

Are Washington and Lee Stu-

much more immature? Are they
so much more irresponsible than

1. “I would like to see class offi-
cers take a more vocal and active
part in administering class respon-
sibilities. By canvassing student
opinion I would hope to obtain a
diversity of student interest and
stimulate interest in referendums,
thus eliminating the apathetic votes.”

2. “I feel that the Honor System
at W&L is an integral part of the
university and should not be altered
in any way.”

3. “On the cut system—I can not
understand why the student should
not be given hte opportunity to rely
upon his own discretion in regulat-
ing his class attendance.”

4.“I would hope to provide ex-
panded facilities for those who did
not choose to join a fraternity —
possibly a pool table, ping-pong ta-
ble and a place to take dates and
dance.”

9. “On the party system as the
political system is now arranged, one
witnesses the forced appointments

Steinger hopes to bring about

As part of his platform he plans
to “encourage more frequent meet-

recognition of non-fraternity stu-

Uninformed Electorate

With the dissolving of the University Party Tuesday night,

the campus political system has been thrown into a chaotic] (jj
state. In rejecting open primaries and nomination conven-|;

tions, the student body has opened itself wide to the danger
of an uninformed electorate and an over abundance of can-

didates.

The dissolving of the party is a step in the right direction;
the absence of an open primary is deplorable. In an effort
to inform the student body as to who is running, we have at-
tempted to gather a list of candidates. We hope to include
a statement from each of the EC candidates, but as of this
writing there are six candidates in the senior class, four in
the junior, and five in the sophomore.

On this page, you will find an article by Fred Mindel on
the qualities required of an EC member. The Ring-tum Phi
hopes this will enable the student body to vote critically and
intelligently. Optimistically, you, the voter, will know who’s

running.

A Salute To Our EC

During this year’s “Big Four” election, it seems that the
Executive Committee caught more than its deserved amount
of gas. The EC this year has entered more actively into real

student government and value

examinations than any recent

EC. Last spring, Jim Kulp, Jim DeYoung, and Malcolm
Mortis (this year’s officers) ran on a platform which they
have proved to be more than a list of “campaign promises.”
First, they have set up a Mock Honor Trial, scheduled
for next Wednesdy (Lee Chapel, 7:30) in order to better
inform the student body on the workings of the honor sys-
tem. This they proposed to do, in their first platform plank.
Second, they have supported the tradition of conventional
dress, but have examined the Assimilation Committee in order
possibly to implement the tradition.
Third, they did discuss the creation of freshman class of-

ficers and effected this change.

Fourth, they proposed monthly meetings of each class’s
officers. This fourth item on their platform was not, to our
knowledge, discussed, It was perhaps not worth consideration.

Fifth, the EC has proposed an agenda of each of its com-
ing meetings and has published the minutes of each EC meet-
ing, in keeping with their fifth plank.

Sixth, referendums have been taken to aid the EC in mak-
ing its decisions on controversial subjects. This was the es-
sence of the sixth platform plank advocating opinion polls.

Seventh, interviews have been held for EC-appointed com-
mittee applicants, and monthly policy statements have been re-

quired of the committee heads.

In six out of seven cases, this year’s EC has lived up to
their campaign proposals — an admirable record. In addition,
they have reapportionel EC representation and have tried to
change a deplorable political situation.

To an EC that has accomplished, has been progressive, has
been one of the best in past years, the Ring-tum Phi offers its
congratulations on a job well done.

 

By FRED MINDEL
EC President-elect

Everyone of us would probably
agree that an EC member should em-
body such general
qualities as hones-
ty, integrity, re-
sponsibility, leader-
ship, and initiative.
But what do such
words mean since
_ qualities are broad
and general yet
each of us defines
and looks for them
in accordance with
our own personal
values and experi-
ence? It is in light of this fact that
I delineate and make more specific
my definition of words such as “in-
tegrity or responsibility,” and what
qualities I personally believe a good
EC member must embody.

1.) Principles. Essential is a set of
principles in which a man_ believes
and to which he has committed him-
self, One of our professors defines a
great man as “one who is commit-
ted to or caught up in something
greater than himself,’ and this defi-
nition has stuck with me and become
incorporated into my scheme of val-
ues. I look for a man who is concerned
with, and dedicated to, principles and
ideals which transcend his own indi-
vidual ambition and status—and
which will result in a responsible
approach to each student's needs. A
fundamental love for W&L coupled
with a desire to keep it moving to-
wards becoming a great university
must be the end for its own sake,
rather than the means to some per-
sonal glorification.

Essential and primary in any scheme
of values and principles is an unyield-
ing. compassionate humanism. This
means dedication to, and concern for,
individual people. This goes beyond
standard conceptions of open-minded
ness, goes beyond obligations to fra-
ternity or coterie of friends, goes be-
yond the artificial restrictions of race,
creed, or color. It comes down to a
fundamental love and respect for the
student body at large, for people at
large, and only when this is true can
one speak to me of “open-mindedness”
or “integrity.”

2.) Idealism vs. Pragmatism. Also
essential is a personal balance between
idealism and practicality. The ideal
EC member should possess the in-
herent intellect and creativity neces-
sary to think in terms other than
merely our existing framework, to
dream and theorize, to cling to these
“ideals” rather than give them up be-
cause “hey’ll never work here.” Yet
this basic idealism must be tempered
by sound judgment and awareness as
to what would be feasible—to what
would be useful. I am talking about
a frame of mind, an attitude—about a
sensibility that dares to experiment

Four Enter Junior EC Race

 

Follo, Grant, Jeffress, Luck

Follo’s Statement

Briefly, my platform consists of
maintaining the Honer System as it
new stands. Such a standpoint must
not be defended by evoking tradition
or names from the past — just be-
eause the Honor System is old does
net mean it should be continued.
But on the other hand, just because
the Honer System is old does not
mean it should be changed either.
We must not create a mere illusion
of pregress through change; nor
should we be lulled inte a feeling of
stability by maintaining the status
quo. Rather, we musi be sensitive
but sensible in our approach to a
modification of the Honor System.

Grant's Statement

As a candidate for the position of
Executive Committeeman of the
Junior Class I would like to take this
opportunity to state my reasons and
qualifications for running for this
alfice.

I believe the position of Executive
Committeeman to be extremely im-
portant to all the members of our
class, for not only is he our repre-
sentative to the student judicial and
legislative bedy, but it is through
him that the class ean make known
its opinions and feelings as he rep-
resents these opinions on the Exe-
cutive Commitiee. As Executive
Committeeman, I would feel my ma-
jor responsibility to be that of active
and accurate representation in pre-
senting the views and opinions of
my class to the Executive Commit-
tee.

The Executive Committee is the
enly government the student bedy has.
This fact makes it doubly important
that the EC truly represent student
opinion.

My qualifications for this position

certain or safe), that dares to take a
stand and make a committment by
clinging to principles and convic-
tions at all costs, that dares to “live
in the present in light of the past,
with an ideal to the future,” (as that
same professor emphasizes), and that
dares to actually “lead” and expose
himself to the risks involved when-
ever one who is committed to an at-
titude or program tries to carry these
into action rather than merely over-
see or ride the gravy train.

3.) Humility. Essential to any EC
member, or person for that matter,
is a fundamental sense of humility.
An acute and penetrating self-honesty
is required here, to look inside and

 

means the outcome is not assuredly take stock of himself, to admit per-

sonal faults and flaws, to be able to
laugh at, and criticise himself, and
to be existentially aware and perpet-
ually conscious of the fact that an EC
member is exactly the same as any
other student in that he is at all times
a person, an individual who is no
more perfect than any other. This
humility has no room for supercilious-
ness, haughtiness, snobbery—it has
no room for anything but each indi-
vidual taken as just that.

4.) Authenticity. Essential to an EC
member (and it probably sounds trite)
is that he be a real person. There is
no room on the EC for one whose
ultimate “telos” is playing a role,
seeking status, or living within an

 

image. These are not “real people.”
The only thing I can ever ask for in
a person is that he be himself, and in
regard to potential EC members, it is
essential that each student be as he
has been throughout our stay at W&L.
It is one thing to cling to beliefs, to
present an attitude and program in
a campaign, yet still another and far-
removed thing to live this attitude and
program, and crucially, to have lived,
embodied and expressed it before this
eleciton week. Many of the EC candi-
dates say basically the same thing,
claim basically the same attitude.
The paramount distinction thus
emerges between those who say
how they will live and those who
live and have lived as they say.

 

Frazier, Griffin, Hash, Humphries, Lee, Moore, Ruffin

 

Frazier’s Statement

It seems to me that the two main
issues in any E.C. election must be
the honor system and representation,
A change has been suggested in the
Honor System that supposedly
would strengthen it. I don’t think
we should ever stop examining and
trying to improve the Honor Sys-
term, but a one year suspension or
graduated punishment for honor vio-
lations would not be an improve-
ment. Instead, I believe it would
greatly weaken the Honor System.
Changing the negative enforcement
of the system is not what is needed.
The thing I'l remember about the
Honor System is not how many peo-
ple got kicked out on honor viola-
tions but the time my Freshman
year when a professor gave me a
quiz to take back to my room and
take when I was ready.

Trust can be a lot more power-
ful enforcement than punishment.
Therefore, I would like to see us
have an exam period like the one at
Randolph - Macon in which two
weeks are set aside for exams and
each student takes his exams when
‘he wants. He arranges with his
professor when he'll turn it in, but
aside from that he can take it when
he wants. This would also elimi-
nate bad exam schedules.

As for representation I think a
monthly meeting of the IFC with the

Independents would help the EC to
better know and represent student
opinion.

I would like to see these improve-
ments made and to seriously and
responsibly represent you — the
Senior Class.

 

Griffin’s Statement

mitteeman from the senior class, I
would like to stress that 1 stand for

 

Seek Junior E C Positions

Jeffress’s Statement

My candidacy for the position of
Junior Class Executive Committee-
man rests on the belief chat my qual-
ifieations, ability, and viewpoints on
the major issues of the campaign
will enable me to represent the ma-
jority views of the members of the
class in an active, aggressive way
which ean translate these views into
action. The qualifications J leave to
the campaign posters; here I wish
only to make my position clear on
issues in four areas:

1) Wholehearted support of the
Honor System as it now stands. Al-
though that the sysiem is not a
utopian solution to the problem it
attacks, I believe that all proposals of
change advanced thus far would alter
the very basis of the system in such
a way that its acknowledged effec-
tiveness would be reduced signifi-
eantly.

2.) Washington and Lee has aban-

 

tions permanently, and should not
to it. 1 believe, however,
‘that the E.C. should take positive
steps to bring about a workable,

| pepularly acceptable nominating sys-
and

is that I get around te each member |

and undesirable. The EC.

Luck’s Statement

The Executive Committee has neg-
leeted a responsibility it holds im-
plicitly as a representative body.
Except for a few notable exceptions
the men on the EC. have failed to
take any decisive action on several
issues of major importance to this
student body — issues which de-
mand solution, such as the conven-
tional dress and assimilation com-
mittee problems, and the problem of
instituting a suitable political system.

I seek an end to this theory of
status quo in student leadership and
student government. It is time for
the Executive Committee to make a
truly concentrated effort to discov-
er the prevailing student opinion
concerning these issues and to make
at last a concentrated effort to act
on these issues. Anything less is
shirking responsibility. To facilitate
the settlement of these issues and
ifuture ones, I propose the extensive
'use of measures such as class polls
and general referendums.

The recent statement by the EC
concerning its stand on the eul sys-
tem is commendable in that it gave
eredance and authority te student
protest. I favor the EC taking more
stands of this nature in similar is-
sues of concern to both the students
and the faculty. By doing so the
Executive Committete can regain its
role as the official spokesman of this
student body in university matters,
and ean again represent the com-
bined voice of the students

neither liberal reform nor dogmatic, judgment and personal objectivity at

conservatism. My every effort will
be directed toward the maintenance
of an open mind.

I have prepared a three-point pro-
gram which I submit for the con-
sideration of the rising senior class.
1.) A complete evaluation and as-
sessment of the present committee
system. 2.) The membership of a
student-at-large on executive com-
mittees. 3.) Maintenance of the pres-
ent status of the honor system.

While I emphatically disagree with
change for the sake of change, or
change in the case where it is not
for the betterment of our school, I
would hope to be the first to recog-
nize and endorse a feasible plan or
idea which directs itself toward posi-
tive objectives and a better learn-
ing environment. These very ideas and
plans are the essence of progressive
change—neither “liberal” nor con-
servative” —progressive.

 

Hash’s Statement

My decision to seek the office of
Senior Class Executive Committee-
man is based on my firm conviction
that the E.C. can and, indeed, must
take a vigorous lead in the conduct
of student government at Washing-
ton and Lee. It is certainly not
enough to be willing to serve, for
many of us possess this desire, but

: ‘it is essential that any candidate for
EC with representatives from the

this position be prepared to dare, to
risk, and even more important, to
think.

The demands which are placed
upon a member of the E.C. are, to
say the least, extensive. I have had
the unique and valuable experience
of attending almost every E.C. meet-
ing this year in my capacity as man-
aging editor of the Ring-tum Phi. I
have observed at first hand the dis-
cussions and deliberations of the E.
C., and I have become increasingly
aware of the potential for construc-
tive action which this body has at
its disposal.

With respect to my position on the
Honor System, I wish to state my
unequivocal support for this insti-
tution as it is presently constituted.
This is not to preclude careful and
reasoned examination of the system
in an effort to render it more effee-
five and beneficial. In reference to
various alternative penalties for

Honor System violations. I should
like to say that I cannot in good’
conseience endorse any of the re-

cently proposed plans. Once again,
I feel that the Honor System as it
stands is not above critical and
searching evaluation if only te
strengthen this tradition which has
so long endured.

In the conduct of the legislative
funetions of the E.C., it is important
that the E.C. be attuned to student
bedy opinions, but these opinions
must be regarded as guidelines
rather than mandates. This is an
area in which the E.C. must take
the lead by stimulating interest and
participation in the often neglected
opportunities available in our uni-
versity community. Student apathy
ean only be cured by a concerted
and econsisient program of the E.C.
which seeks to involve students and
faculty in the total experience of
Washington and Lee.

There are a number of problems
on this campus with which next
years Executive Commitiee must
coneern itself. These difficulties are
obvious to all of us, and in addition,
they have been discussed in the re-
eent student bedy elections. The cut
system, the political dilemma, and
conventional dress are several areas
which require the immediate and
eareful attention of the E.C.

It is my intention to represent the
senior class on the E.C. in a manner
eonsistent with those principles

promise that I shall treat every issue
with all the resources of sound

 

 

my disposal.

 

Humphries’s Statement

Fellow Classmates:

I want to do it — it isn’t a mat-
ter of prestige or position, but rath-
er a mattter of who will represent
you on the Executive Committee and
what he will do for you and for the
University.

I am of the opinion that one
should always willingly advocate
change if improvement is necessary,
but if something works well and
can not be strengthened, then change
is not a necessity in itself.

I advocate the honor system in all
its ramifications beeause it works,
and works well. I do feel, however,
that it should be extended by the
Administration to the library so that
the stacks could be open from 8:15
a.m. to 12:00 noon inclusive.

I advocate conventional dress, for
it is a characteristic that makes this
University different from the sweat-
shirted masses of other colleges and
universities. Without it Washington
and Lee would not seem to be Wash-
ington and Lee.

I feel that certain changes could
be made in the Student Control
Committee, having served on it. For
example, I feel that “drunk while
driving” eases should be left entirely
to our courts of law, especially
since enly Lexington cases come be-
fore the Committee. Besides trying
the individual twice, it seems ,in-
equitable that Lynchburg, ane
or Buena Vista cases do not reach
the Committee.

The cut system should be liberal-
ized, in that on a campus on which
the individual may drink, may own
automobiles in his sophomore year,
and may rent apartments rather than
living in dormitories, it seems to be
an anachronism that the individual
is led by the hand to class.

I feel that I am qualified to rep-
resent you. I want to represent you
— yours is the decision — it is as
you will.

 

Lee’s Statement

We often tend to question why the
more important traditions at Wash-
ington and Lee work. The more
skeptical among us insist that con-
ventional dress works, not because
the student bedy considers it a
worthy tradition, but because the
Assimilation Committee exists to
feree compliance to the letter of the
conventional dress code. These erit-
ies also suggest that the Honor Sys-
tem is an effective one, not because
Washington and Lee students are
basically honorable men, but because
they are “cowered” into honesty by
the fear of expulsion; that, in fact,
any alteration of the absolute rem-
edy would precipitate a rash of hon-
or violations. And it has been these
same people who have urged the re-
tention of a fraternity-based politi-
eal system because the siudent bedy
was incapable of nominating its own
eandidates. This last myth, perhaps
the most eynical and ludicrous of
them all, has recently been preven
patently absurd.

Ironically, it has been these same
people who have centended that
Washington and Lee is a somewhat
“ideal” community: that the very
size and homogeniety of the student
bedy eontributes te the effective ex-
ercise of these traditions. I also be-
lieve that Washington and Lee is an
unique academic community. But if
it is “ideal,” why cannot we adopt a
more idealistic approach to our tra-
ditiens: why must we eontinue to
think in terms ef absolute penal-
ties? Cannot we experiment with
eonventional dress to determine
whether or not it ean be satiafae-
iorily maintained withoul an assimi-

a string of victories as the Washing-

ton and Lee track team finished its.
'|dual meet season Wednesday.

The Generals mashed the North
Carolina school 90-55 to conclude a
5-2 record. All of the victories fol-
lowed spring vacation.

Winning 11 events to the visitors’
six, the Generals were never seri-
ously threatened. Once again, an al-

| tered lineup was used to hold down

the score. Bill Wildrick, Brad Shin-
kle and Moulton Dowler swept the
mile. Freshman Luke Meadors won
both the long jump and the triple
jump.

John Graham won the pole vault,
followed by Gary Wilkinson, as Dan
Manson, Ted Larson and Rich Hart-
grove took seconds in the shot put,
discus and high jump respectively.
Jeff Kugel was third in the javelin.

Sprinter Chris Kell won the 440
yard dash in :51.6, followed by Spen-

 

| Bill Miller took the top two places
Elon College provided the fifth in

in the 120 high hurdles, Kugel win-
ning in 17.1. They reversed positions
in the 330 intermediate hurdles, with
Miller winning in 42.9.

George Parker won the 880 in 2:-
08.2 and Andy Kilpatrick took third.
Quarter miler Bob Bigham won the
20 in 23.1 as John Wiley placed third.
Lee Johnson won the two mile in
10:18.8 as Riff O'Connor took sec-
ond. The Generals also won the 440
relay in 44.5,

The mile relay proved an Elon
victory as the “official” W&L team
composed of pole vaulters finished
behind the vistors and three “unof-
ficial” General teams. In the spec-
ial 440 weightmen’s relay, Elon
barely nudged out the fleet-footed
Generals.

Over Springs Weekend, a group of

at the Davidson College Relays. The

Nash’s Statement

I am glad to have been given this
opoprtunity te express to you my
position as a candidate for Sepho-
more Representative to the Executive
Committee. Experience is a quality
which is needed to perform any job
well, And serving on the Executive
Committee of Washington and Lee
University is no exception. In view
of the experience I have gained dur-
ing this year, I sincerely believe that
I am well qualified to help lead this
school forward; to make a great uni-
versity even greater.

There are many things, large and
small, eoncerning Washington and
Lee which need a course of action.
Why can’t we push hard fer unlimit-
ed cuts for the upper three classes?
Why can’t we supply the Student
Union with a decent television set,
a juke box for dances, ping-pong
tables, and other recreational facili-
ties? Definite steps must be made
one way or another concerning con-

ventional dress and the Assimilation)
Committee. Why can't ways be found

for lifting Washington and Lee’s
school spirit and supporting our
athletic teams? Why can't something
be done about having the stacks in
the library open during dinner
hours? If I am elected, 1 will be
one of two, or possibly three mem-
bers of the Executive Committee re-
turning from this year. With my
year of what might be ealled “sen-
jority”, I will be able to lead the
fight for all of these things and
consequently make Washington and
Lee closer to being not just one of
the best, but the best.

However, the Executive Commit-
tee has a function other than that of
debating and voting on reforms and

petitions. This function is its most
important that of conducting hon-
or trials.

You must remember that

 

 

 

 

night will sit, listen, weigh the facts,
and come to a decision concerning
each student accused of an honor
violation. The Executive Committee
next year is going to need members
who have experience in conducting
honor trials, experience in weighing
facets, and experience in making de-
cisions. The Committee needs men
who are composed, f[ ree-thinking,
and of sound judgment.

The selection of representatives to
the Executive Committee is not one
to be taken lightly. I am convinced
that you want to get Washington and
Lee moving in a forward direction.
And with the experience that I have
obtained, I feel confident that I can
lead us forward.

I would like to thank you very
much for your support.

Smith’s Statement

As your Executive Committeeman,
I will be in constant communication
with you so that I will be able to
accurately and effectively represent
class opinion. I will poll the entire
class a minimum of three times dur-
ing the school year (Sept., Dec., and
March) to learn your views on cam-
pus questions. This polling will en-
able me to orient my actions and to
take the exact position which the
class as a whole favors on a particu-
lar matter. You, in turn, will be
regularly informed as to what I am
doing by reports or columns in the
Ring-tum Phi. Your suggestions will
be welcomed at all times and will be
considered with an open mind.

I will devote to this office the
time and energy which it demands
and meet the responsibilties which
accompany it. As your Executive
mittee, I will be a field officer rather
than a desk officer.

I hold the following opinions on
present issues:

A. Maintenance of the Honor Sys-
tem as it now stands.

B. Adherence to conventional dress
rules.

C. Removal of the existing cut
system.
D. Revision of the existing cut

E. Expanded recreation facilities

Head’s Statement

I believe in the basie principles of
the honor system as it now stands,
and I believe that I am qualified to
help uphold those traditions that
have made the system what it is to-
day. I favor the movement to revise
the cut system and its penalties.
And if elected I will strive to see
that there is more participation by
the student body and our class in
particular in the affairs of our stu-
dent government.

 

I am earnestly interested in serv-

 

and ability, and if selected I will try
to keep its interests at heart.

 

 

Winn’s Statement

As a candidate for one of the
Sophomore positions on the Execu-
tive Committee, I feel it is essential
that my classmates understand my
reasons for seeking office—that is,
what I hope to represent and what
I intend to accomplish. I am sincere
in my interest in Washington and
Lee and am asking for recognition
in a leadership capacity so that by
working through the students I may
earnestly endeavor to make worth-

while contributions and improve-
ments where there as an evident
need.

I want to serve in an office where
I can legislate in behalf of the stu-|
dents, and I would always be anx-,
ious to discuss or look into any as-
pect of W&L which might merit
revision or strengthening. One of
the most distressing deficiencies at
this university is the lack of school
spirit; 1 would like to see a renewal
of enthusiasm in attendance of ath-
letic events in light of the disap-

Stickmen Lees To Hofstra, 17-11;

Klingelhofer Paces W&L Attack

Washington and Lee’s lacrosse
team lost its second game in a row
Wednesday afternoon as the local
stickmen were defeated by Hofstra
17-11 in a game that had been post-
poned from earlier this season.

W&L got off to a bad start in the
contest, trailing 5-0 before the first
General goal. Early in the second
quarter W&L tied the match at five
apiece but the New York school
added four more goals before the
half ended to pick up a 9-5 lead.

The third quarter was bad for
W&L. Hofstra got three quick goals
at the start of the period and added
three more before the period ended
while the Generals were scoreless.
W&L made a comeback in the final
period, outscoring Hofstra by a 6-2
margin, but it was the old story of
too little, too late.

In Hofstra, Washington and Lee
was facing a big, tough, fast team
featuring one of the top scorers in
the east, Sam Mordetti. He was aver-
aging three goals and four assists
per game. W&L’s Bendann held him

to just two goals and one assist, but
the Generals didn’t hold Jim Griffith.
Carroll Klingelhofer led W&L with
three goals and three assists, bring-
ing his season totals to 21 goals and
20 assists. Also coming in for praise
from Coach Dana Swan was Bob
Frost “who played his best game of
the year in many respects.” Frost
scored one goal and played a real
tough game defensively.

The Generals next see action to-
morrow when they travel to Chester-
ton, Maryland, to face a highly-rated
Washington College squad.

The Generals are in pretty good
shape for the game with no injrries
having been reported. Coach Swan
said, “We can beat Washington but
it's going to take a heck of a lot
of doing.” He pointed to their speed
as the biggest problem facing the
Generals.

After Saturday's encounter with
Washington the Generals will travel
to Towson for a game against Towson
College. Little is known about their
team this year.

lation committee? Can we not at-
tempt to determine whether or not
the absolute penalty is indispensible
to the effective exercise of the Hon-
or System? Can't we attempt to
reconcile our Honor System with
prevailing concepts of justice with-
out weekening it? Can't we at least
experiment with these traditions, and
if we are proved wrong, then we
shall have merely proven the skep-
ties among us right. But is it not
possible that these things can be ac-
complished, and if they can, is it
not our responsibility to experiment
with them?

During the recent school elections
we heard much about “active repre-
sentation.’ The candidate who coined
this expression was given an over-
whelming mandate from the student
body. Now it is out obligation to
insure that Fred Mindel will not be
hamstrung by an
Executive Committee. It is our re-
sponsibility to elect to membership
on the Executive Committee those
candidates who have consistently
expressed similar sentiments.

Moore’s Statement

I have no startling new platform

a “status-quo” man. In order to be
effective, an honor system must be
strong and to a certain extent un-

1c.

unsympathetic

 

I am also for the continued and

increased use of both the E.C. and!

the ODK Forum, as a joint effort,
in presenting to the faculty recom-
mendations for changes and reform.
The faculty will listen to what we
have to say if it is sound enough as
representative of the student body.
Besides the cut system, which cer-
tainly needs overhauling, and the
possibility of no classes on Saturday
(a possibility which becomes more
and more a reality the more we raise
our voices), there should be consid-
eration of a change in the schedul-
ing of exams. If we have a true
honor system which is respected by

the faculty as well as the students}

shouldn’t we be allowed to
when we want to take an
exam? Because our honor system
works, the professor would have
only one exam to make out, and it
could be arranged so that the pro-
fessor would get the papers in time
to grade them. Exam grades have
become too important to have to
suffer because one has a number of
exams very close together.

Ruffin’s Statement

There are seven candidates for the
two Senior E.C, positions. I seek
this position because I find that five
of them represent an approach to
student government which I do not
share.

When Fred Mindel was elected
President of next year’s E.C., a wave
of instant progressivism swept the
campus. This new outlook is reflect-
ed in the programs of my opponents.
With minor exceptions, I am in ac-
cord with the statements of my op-
ponents; who wouldn’t be? All call
for a more active E.C. which will
take the initiative in those areas it
has too long ignored.

 

between me and
that I called for
jexpanded E.C. activity before Fred
Mindel won, and they have chosen
to climb onto the band wagon after
these programs have proved their
appeal to the student body. With
the exception of Bob Lee, my op-
ponents have recently acquired a
dubious, new-found progressivism.

As a member of Fred Mindel’s
campaign staff, I participated in the
development of the program for
“active representation.” The essence
of this program is that the Washing-
ton and Lee Student Body, through
its student government, must assume
a greater role in all aspects of the
University: academic, social and cul-
tural. My opponents have typically
been identified with the status quo.

pointing support received this year—
perhaps “pep rallies” would revive
a spirit which seems to have left
W&L years ago!

It certainly is regrettable that the
other class officers aren't delegated
more responsibility, and I would
hope to see these leaders working
together with the E.C. members
to obtain a diversity of student opin-
ion. I have been confronted with
these an dmany other valid innova-
tions which I am eager to see acti-
vated.

It is one thing for them to espouse
the policies which won the most re-
cent election, but do they really be-
lieve them?

If next year’s E.C. is to be able
to expand its activity and play a
more vital role in initiating im-
provements at Washington and Lee,
its members must seriously be in-
terested in these positive goals. If
elected, it is in this new spirit that
I will serve.

W&L has a great deal to offer
to any individual, and I am sure that
my four years here will be memor-
able and advantageous, but I hope
to accomplish much more than ob-
taining an education if given the op-
portunity. I cannot overemphasize
the importance of judging the vari-
ous candidates on the basis of their

His swift rise in Illinois polities and
impressive showing in his first try

speculation about Perey as poten-

state levels, Perey decided to run|
for the Republican gubernatorial
nomination. Percy visited 44 county
fairs, shook 125,000 hands, and cov-
ered more than 140,000 miles by

plane, bus, train, and car.
ord primary election that saw over
a million registered Republicans
turn out, Percy beat his opponent
by more than a quarter of amillion
votes.

He lost to his Democrat opponent
in the November elections which
followed.

Popularity Rises Still

Perey has received mumerous
awards and special accolades in the
course of his active business and po-
litical life. He holds six honorary
degrees, is chairman of the board of
a Ford Foundation sub-committee,
and is a trustee of the California In-
stitute of Technology and of his
alma mater, the University of Chi-

Benevolent Dissolution

The building and grounds crew probably didn’t like it, but
last night’s elections were a success for the student body. The
University Party, which was gracious enough to disband for
one election but which predicted that the election would by
the absence of itself become a “travesty,” was wrong. The
student body managed quite well without a political party this
time.

Without the damper of Clique nominations an unpre-
cedented number of candidates seized the initiative and ran
on their own, the most healthy thing possible for student gov-
ernment. Although all the class elections were not decided last
night due to the necessity of run-offs between some of the
candidates, many races were decided. For the rest of the races,
last night’s voting was essentially a primary. The result will
be that the officers elected in this election are going to be the
ones chosen by the students themselves on the basis of candi-
dacies offered on individual initiative. It is hard to see how
such a neglect is a travesty — it is democracy.

Last night’s relatively poor turnout points to an improve-
ment which could be easily made in class election procedures
by the E.C. — to offer voting all day, as in student body elec-
tions ,instead of just for a few minutes one night. The nomi-
nations and speeches could be held the night before, and al-
though attendance might not be the best, as is the case with
student body elections, recent elections have tended to hit the
student body via literature and individual campaigning prior
to the speeches anyway. The run-offs for the present election
are being held only for a half-day; it is hard to see why the
E.C. cannot or should not hold the polls open for a whole day.

The Executive Committee seems to have been strangely
unprepared for the multiple candidacies which caused, as any-
body could have foretold, run-offs in many cases. The E.C.
spent a lot of time last night arguing over who to include in
the run-offs, but such procedure is explained in Robert's
Rules of Order. According to Article IV, Section F, of the
student body constitution, the E.C. should be following this
procedure.

Trends in the voting last night would be hard to point
out; perhaps they will appear more definitely after Thursday's
run-offs. At the present time, the important factors in this
election that can be commented on is that no political party
chose any nominees — the nominees ran for the offices if they
had the initiative. This is a fantastic improvement over past
elections, and the fact that the elections went successfully
proves that parties are unnecessary in essence. In the future,
perhaps parties will assume their rightful role in elections: that
of running free and fair primaries in advance of the elections,
and of organizing campaigns for the winners of their pri-
maries. In this way way nominees could be saved most of the
expense which many candidates had to shoulder in the present
election.

subject a minutely exact ear is need-

little talent for writing speakable
dialogue, so that the words which
should instantly conjure up the man

to have been spoken by anyone
any where.

Executive Committee would be: 1)

spontaneous invention. However, at
least it is hard thought in the right
direction, and the result is for the
most part very fetching indeed.
Also, Donner demonstrates a tal-
ent for getting the best out of his
actors: if Millicent Martin as a mod-
ern upper-class miss (snooty but
sexy with it) is appreciably miscast,
Alan Bates haas exactly the neces-
sary mixture of charm, and
lessness as the arriviste
holm Elliott gives an excellent per-
formance as the instructor who
makes over his own past into the
hero’s future. Indeed, it is a pity in
more ways than one that he has to
be murdered two-thirds of the way
through the film. Apart from any-
thing else, this does play havoe with

any satirie point the plot may have|

had as a representative case (if the
meteoric rise of the hero can only

be achieved by way of murder, that!

many fewer junior clerks in the au-
dience are going to try it.) But as a
light (visually speaking, at least)
often witty fantasy,Nothing But the
Best still has enough charm and en-
tertainment value to send one, if

PLEASE CALL AT MY OFFICE
DURING THE FOLLOWING
HOURS
11:10 - 12:05

XAVIER PINTO,
Dean.

It came to me at 8:50 during my
Medieval History class. Immediate-
ly, three questions forced their way
into my mind: a) who was Dean
Pinto?; a) what was he dean of?;
c) why did he want to see me? All
I could do was wait until 11:10.

Which I did, in the library, mull-
ing over old Ring-tum Phi's, dis-
covering no clue as to Dean Pinto’s
identity or how one R-tP could be
distinguished from another. (J firm-
ly believe that in 1948 an original
copy was printed and since that time
has been distributed twice weekly
among the faculty and student body.
There is no way to prove or dispute
this claim, however.)

Eleven ten found me_ entering

atively the same: several hundred

one o [the secretaries:

“Uh, ma’m, my name’s Crowley.
I'm here to see Dean Pinto.” I held

out the ecard.

“Oh yes. You can go right in.
He's expecting you.”

“Thank you.” I looked around,

puzzled. Dean Pinto’s office was ob-
viously somewhere in the room. But
how was I to find it? I decided to
use an old Indian trick that is,
deseribing a steadily expanding pat-
tern of concentric circles.

An hour later, I was back where
I started: “Uh, ma’m, | wonder if
you could help me. I don’t seem to
be able to Dean Pinto’s of-

By TOM CARPENTER

This past Saturday was the horse
raving fan’s delight, what with the:
Kentucky Derby and the Virginia
Gold Cup Races. One had his pick)
of sitting at home and watching the)
kine of the flat races in the United
States or going to Warrenton, Vir-
ginia, and seeing in person a combi-
nation of flat, hurdle, and timber
races. Some ingenous souls did both
by taking along to Warrenton bat-
tery-powered portable televisions.

Gold Cup Event

The Gold Cup quite social
event in Virginia, as the crowd con-
sists of ambassadors to the every-
day working-man. Anyone willing
to shell out fifteen bills is weleome
at the Gold Cup with one guest.

Equipment for such an outing con-

 

is

a

ts of a blanket or chairs, an ice
cooler filled to the brim with cold
beer or some stronger concoction,

and a pieniec lunch. This year um-
brellas also were the call as a thun-
derstorm became an unexpected part
of the day’s events.

Bookmaking Shops

The Gold Cup Committee also pro-
vided the man with a flare for gamb-
ling with the necessary opportunity
to satisfy himself by allowing any-
who willing to pay fifty
bueks for a Federal Gambling Stamp
to set up a bookmaking shop at the
base of the hill.

one Is

One might regard these gentle-
men as crooks as soon as he sees

the odds they offer on the horses
running in the Kentucky Derby and
in the Gold Cup. It seems safe to
aassume that they enjoy a profitable
day's work.

The biggest preblem one has is
making logical selections of winners
in the Gold Cup races because in-
formation on the horses is hard to
come The clue to their
ability the weight allowances,
which are often based on past ree-
ord. Besides, the best horse in the

jump.
Hill Obseures View

The track itself is laid out around

'a large hill, which most of the spec-

tators sit on the side of another hill

| outside of the racing area. Thus, vis-

ion of a race is obscured when the

| horses go behind the hill in the cen-

ter of the track. A unique experi-
ence I suffered on my first trip to
the Gold Cup was watching my
horse go behind the hill, never to
be seen by me again. For all I
know he may be buried back there.

There are six races on the day's
agenda, although this year
were seven because of an unusually
high number of entries in the last

race. After the fifth one the public;

address system is used for the broad-
east of the Derby, although this year
the fire at Churchill Downs delayed
activity until after the sixth race.

Kentucky Derby

The Derby was interesting this
year in that heavy favorite finished
next to last and a longshot almost
managed to pull out the victory. Of
the four tickets of various kinds and
owned by various people that I was
holding, nene was worth a blade of
grass.

Flag Raiser, on whom a friend

had placed five dollars to place, led

early and faded. Tom Rolfe, on
whom the group had two $2 win

tickets and one $5 place ticket, just
did not have the speed to do the
trick and finished third.

Reports from Louisville indicate that
a large delegation from W&L was in
atendance at the Derby and various
related functions. Although the infield
at Cehurchill Downs was particularly
hot, some of the real excitement and
color of the race was found here rather
than on the nearby track

In the Viriginia Geld Cup race,
the main event of the day, I took my
chances with an older horse, who
naturally finished last and was so
far behind he skipped the last two
jumps and still was unable to gain

consecutive Virginia collegiate track
title on Saturday in Wililamsburg.
The Washington and Lee track team
tied for eighth place in the meet
which attracted thirteen of the state’s
top track outfits. In the freshman
division the Generals placed seventh
with 9'2 points as William and Mary
also took that title with Virginia a

For the Generals, the outstanding
performance for the afternoon was

istic way when it involves itself in

a war 4,000 miles from its own terri-

tory?

In an accompanying article, Dr.
Colvin speaks of the difficulties in
convincing Americans of various po-
litical persuasions that our ultimate
desire is a withdrawal on acceptable
terms. If we have trouble convinc-
ing those who have been brought up
in an atmosphere permeated with
American international benevolence
of our good intentions, how are we
to convince those whose background
has been dominated by anti-Ameri-
can feelings of one degree or another?

If the United States is to lose this
bad name it seems to have acquired
in many places, it must broaden its
“official line.” Our present “holier
than thou” stance is regarded as
hypocritical among even the friend-
liest of our overseas allies. People
are getting tired of hearing how we
have been selected as God’s chosen
people to save the teming millions
from communism, the greatest evil
ever conceived by man.

We must show that we oppose
communism not just because it is
communism per se, but because it
happens to be antithetical to certain

rights which we consider to be in-
violatable. In other words, our dis-|
taste for communism should be

shown to fit into a previously form-|

ulated framework of unacceptable

political practices, rather than being!

one unto itself.

The fighting in Vietnam and the)

intervention in the Dominican Re-
public in themselves do not really)
bear on the question; what is im-
portant, however, is why
fighting and intervening. Viewed in
this light, the key to our success in

the world arena will rest in the rev-)

to be)
to be
labeled

elation of what we consider
certain evils which happen
wrapped up in a package
“communism.”

28 votes.

In the race for class historian, Bob
Priddy polled 62 votes, Tom Hardin
polled 28, Rob Reading polled 29,

votes. Priddy, Hardin, and Reading
will face each other in the run off.

Morris Chairs Meeting

Malcolm Morris, student body sec-
retary, acted as chairman of the
meeting. As the meeting opened, a
motion was presented and carried
by voice vote that allowed only the
candidates for executive committee-
men to make speeches. All other
candidates were nominated without
comment.

The remarks by the four men
seeking the E.C. positions were on
the whole very brief. All the candi-
dates stated their support for the
honor system. Various changes were
suggested by all four candidates.
Kirk Follo promised to work for a
new and more just cut system and a

change in the grading system which
he has already presented to the exe-
cutive committee of the faculty. Bill
Jeffress suggested that the E.C. work
toward better facilities for non fra-
ternity students, drinking at univer-
sity sponsored athletic and _ social
actiivties, and the abolishment of
Saturday classes. Jody Luck, who
placed third in this race, attacked
the present E.C. for ignoring the
needs of the student body.

Bill Grant, who trailed in the exe-
cutive committeeman election, prom-
ised to seek a concensus of student
opinion and ideas rather than trying
to put across only his own.

Vice President-elect Alan Wade
was opposed by Buddy Nicklin, a
nominee of the Do Nothing Party.
Wade won with 100 votes against
Nicklin’s 37, The Do Nothings also
nominated Tom Hardin for historian
and will get another try at that posi-
tion in the run off. It had been an-
nounced that Do Nothing candidate
Duncan LaMonte would seek the of-
fice of secretary, but LaMonte with-
draw yesterday.

THE RING-TUM PHI

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

Friday Edition

 

Not Quite a Travesty

Class elections this week proved to be something less than|

the “travesty” predicted by many so-called campus politicos.
This week’s results proved rather convincingly that students
can select competent leaders without the guiding hand of a
clique.

The election was also significant in that it showed a simple
solution to the seemingly difficult task of selecting leaders.
Next year students could run in “‘completely open primaries”’
which, in effect was what happened in Monday’s actual elec-
tion. After the primary a regular election could follow.

Any student who wished to seek office would be given an
opportunity to do so under this system and the student body
could then select their leaders without the high-pressure often
associated with the clique system or any fraternity connections.

 

Active Representation

With the election of class officers yesterday and Tuesday's
selection of IFC officers for next year, the annual Spring
thrust of posters, papers, and propaganda has been completed.

Elected officials have based their entire campaigns on a
new era of “active representation” in student body govern-
ment. It is the hope of the Friday Edition of the Ring-tum Phi
that these campaign promises won’t disappear as do the leaves| ~~
each Fall.

Next year’s leaders are going to find it necessary to go
to the students, not expect students to come to them, if an

effective system of representation is to matetrialize. The ODK

Leadership Forum and the IFC may provide channels through
which the E.C. can work in order to get badly needed student
opinion .

The newly elected Executive Committee should give both
these bodies immediate consideration as channels for a student
voice. If either could be developed, a significant improvement
in student government at this is University may well occur.

W&L Edges L.C. 7- 6

On Perreault Homer

By LOCK HANDLEY

The power was finally on for the W&L baseball team)

Tuesday as they won their second game of the season, beat:

ing Lynchburg College 7-6.

The Generals got ten hits, in-|

cluding home runs by Larry Perreault and Ashley Allen and
Tom Crenshaw’s second triple of the year.

The win was also the second for righthander Pete Heu-|
against®¥—————

mann. As in his no-hitter
RPI, Heumann had most
trouble in the early

of
innings. |

his |

Lynchburg bunched six of their ten; But Lose To Washington;

hits in the second to go ahead 5- -2,|
after singles by Perrault and Dave
Kirkpatrick gave W&L an early
lead. The curveballing sophomore
setled down after that and gave up
only one more run,

Perreault tied it up in the fourth
with his homer, which came with
Guy Townley and Ed Bishop on|
base. Crenshaw tripled in the fifth
and came in on Skip Chase’s fly
ball, and Allen homered in the sev-
enth to put the game on ice.

Crenshaw finished the regular
season as the top General hitter.
The former Keydet, who was
switched from catcher to the out-
field midway through the season,
added a single to his triple Tues-
day to finish up with a .351 aver-

age. He also collected the first
W&L home run earlier in the sea-
son. Heumann led the pitching

staff in ERA as well as in games
won.

The Generals left yesterday
morning for the CAC tournament
at Sewanee, but with little hope of
bringing home a third victory to
offset their nine collegiate defeats.
Due to disciplinary problems which
have removed several of the more
experenced members of the squad,
W&L will go into the meet with a
lineup made up mostly of freshmen
and a three-man pitching staff. In-
fielder Larry Perreault has looked
good on the mound in several brief
appearances, but Coach Joe Lyles
is still woefully shorthanded.
Especially damaging will be the
absence of shortstop Kirkpatrick,
the team’s second leading hitter,
who quit the squad in the second
inning of Tuesday’s game.

The team to beat in the meet
should again be Washington, the
winner for the last two years and

one of the best small college teams
in the country. Unless they can
coordinate pitching with hitting,
and sharpen up the defense (which
committed seven errors against
Lynchburg), the Generals are a
definite pick to finish last.

 

Netters Lose to Wahoos;
Compete In CAC Today

Washington and Lee’s tennis squad
went down to its fourth defeat of
the season in a close match with
the University of Virginia netters
here on Tuesday.

The General netters lost to the
rugged Wahoos by a 6-3 margin
While losing five of the six singles
matches, the Generals did well in
the doubles, winning two of three.

Randy Jones did the top job of the
day for W&L winning his singles
match and then teaming with For
rest Dickinson to take the Virginia
number two doubles team. In a big
upset, the singles team of Jim De
Young and Lindsey Short handed
Virginia's number one singles team
its first defeat of the year.

W&L is now 6-4 on the season
The Generals this weekend are com-
peting in the annual College Ath-
letiec Conferences tournament in Se-

shooting, with Washington having a
43-29 edge in that department.

Generals Beat Towson

Monday, Towson was the oppon-
ent. The Maryland school was fresh
from a 7-6 upset victory over Loyola
of Baltimore. W&L jumped off to
four quick goals in the first period,
however, and never was headed as
the Generals picked up an 8-6 vic-
tory in 95 degree weather.

The Generals played a fine control
game allowing Towson to clear just
17 of 39 attempts, while W&L was
able to clear 21 of 27 against Towson.
The Generals had a big 67-39 edge
on ground balls and outshot Towson
43-28.

Carroll Klingelhofer played a fine
game fo rthe Generals scoring the
final goal and picking up three as-
sists on the first four General goals.
He now has 22 goals and 23 assists
on the season. Lamont scored two
goals and assisted Klingelhofer in
his fourth period goal, Mike Mich-
ales had two goals as did Bob Frist
while Bob Ostroff scored one.

Coming in for particular praise
from Coach Dana Swan was the
third General midfield of Daesner,
LaMonte, and Chip Chew. Swan said
they played a fine game against
Towson and allowed W&L to run
three midfields against Towson’s
two, to help wear down the Mary-
land school.

West had another fine game at
goalie as did substitute Frank Mor-
gan who came in late in the game.
Wicky Stuart played one of his
best games as did Bowersox who
played a consistently fine game.

Tomorrow the Generals will at-
tempt to even the record at 5-5 in
a game here at 2 p.m. against Loyola.
W&L will be trying to revenge
losses to Loyola the last two years

Loyola has a record of 3-4 so far
this season, but they've looked bet-
ter than that. They handed Swarth-

Qualifying heats in 11 of 17 events
in the Third annual College Athletic
Conference Track and Field Meet at
the University of the South in Sewa-
nee, Tennessee began at 3 p.m. to-
day.

Finals in these 11 events as well
as the other six will be run off to-
morrow beginning at 9:30 for the
field events and 2:30 for the running
events.

The Generals are represented in
the meet by a full squad of 23 men.
These men, the nucleus of the team,
which compiled a 5-2 dual meet rec-
ord, will be aiming at ending Wash-
ington University’s two year domi-
nation of the annual event. W&L
finished third last year behind Wash-

The 440 relay team of Chris Kell,
Rob Orr, Spencer Sullivan and Bob
Bigham are strong favorites. Kell,
Orr and Sullivan will also be run-
ning in the 100 and 220. Bigham
leads freshmen John Wiley and Rick
Meiser in the 440, and joins Jim
Thompson and Bill Wildrick in the
880.

Co-captain Andy Kilpatrick and
Lee Johnson head the mile entries
which also include Ralph O’Connor
and freshmen George Parker and
Bob Stack. Johnson and O’Connor
are entered in the two-mile. The
hurdling crew of Mike Goode, Bob

strong threats.

The meet is the finale to the Gen-
eral track season.

 

W&L trackman Jeff Kugel breezes to victory in the 120 yard high hur-

Kugel also picked up points in the low

hurdles and javelin to lead the Generals to a 90-55 win.

Charles Percy
Says Viet War
Might Be Long

Illinois Republican
Predicts U.S. Victory
In Lee Chapel Address

If the war in Viet Nam “is a short
war, we'll lose it; if it’s a long one,
we'll win it,’ a leading Republican
said here Friday.

Charles H. Percy, of Illinois, ad-
dressing several hundred at Washing-
ton and Lee University’s Lee Chapel,
said a recent tour of Viet Nam has
convinced him, “We must have pa-
tience.

Percy said it will take time to de-
feat the Viet Cong communists be-
cause it is jungle, guerrilla type war-
fare. He added that he is “strongly in
favor of the president’s policy” in
Viet Nam and “there is little ques-
tion in my mind that if we pull out,”
we will eventually lose all of south-
east Asia.

Percy said he hopes soldiers from
other countries can be brought in to
help the U.S. fight the communists.
He listed the Australians, Thais and
Filippinos among others.

The Illinois Republican spoke here
at the invitation of Washington and
Lee senior Jim De Young, a neigh-
bor and good friend of Percy's in Ken-
ilworth, Ill, and a worker last fall in
Percy's unsuccessful bid for the Illi-
nois governorship.

Percy left no doubt in his audience's
mind he will seek the governor’s seat
the next time around, too.

“We hope to run the rascals out,”
he said in answer to a question on
how his next campaign will differ from
last year’s.

Percy, the 45-year-old board chair-
man at Bell & Howell Co., is in this
area to attend the President's Business
Advisory Council meeting at nearby
Hot Springs.

mittee. Selection was made by an

quet is given by the Alumni Asso-
ciation to weleome the seniors as

Fall Fraternity Rushing Program

Modified By IFC

By JUDSON SIMMONS !
Retiring IFC president Steve Hib-|
bard turned over his duties to newly |
elected president Chuck Griffin at)
last night’s weekly meeting. Griffin
then presented Hibbard a gavel on|
behalf of the IFC for his services
during the past year.

Three topics dominate the discus-
sion of the relatively short meeting
The House Managers Association,
CONTACT, and rush week were
considered in some detail.

The House Managers Association
was dissolved and its duties taken
over by the IFC. This new respon-|
sibility of the council will include
payment to Bob Murry during the
summer for checking each fraternity
house daily and paying the Orkin
Pest Control Company for its ser-
vices during the summer.

CONTACT was officially taken un-
der the auspices of the IFC. The
four point notion which was passed
follows. 1) The IFC is to sponsor
CONTACT; 2) The IFC is to appoint
a representative to the steering com-
mittee of the symposium which will
be held every year except Mock
Convention years; 3) The IFC Ju-
diciary Board is to elect the chair-
man of CONTACT with the recom-
mendation of the past chairman; 4)
The IFC will assume any debits ol
CONTACT after all other sources of
revenue have been exhausted

As a result of this year's weekend

will be of $1
man to cover some outstanding
bills. Griffin also stressed that ap-
plications are being received until
this Friday for the position of CON-
TACT chairman for 1066
minor revisions in the
for next year. A

addition beer may be served at the

This revision was instituted to give

| the freshman who has been to twelve |

houses and not asked back a last
chances to see houses they are par-
ticularly interested in. To insure
that freshmen will be given this op-
portunity, each house will be re-
quired to hold one open rush date
Another change in the rushing
procedure eliminated the practice of
signing up freshmen for rush dates
in the Quad. This innovation was

| adopted because a good many [ra-

ternities were using their tables in
the Quad to arrange rush dates rath-
er than open houses.

Griffin reminded the council that
there will be a meeting of all presi-
dents and rush chairmen at 6:45 on

Also, the juniors showed much more

Even with the poll indicating that

Beside these frontrunners, there was
a definite indication from the poll that
The Shirelles, The Righteous Broth-
ers, Ike and Tina Turner and The Im-
pressions were favorites at W&L. In
the folk music field, lan and Sylvia,
Baez, The Serendipity Singers
and the New Cristy Minstrels were
favored, in that order, Although defi-

eform of Absence Regulations

Unlimited Cuts for Juniors and Seniors;
Lower Classes Granted Increased Cuts;

Automatic Overcut Penalty Changed

By FRANK FAIRCHILD ...

At its regular monthly meeting yesterday, the Faculty
adopted a new resolution which will afford juniors and seniors
the opportunity of determining their own class attendance and
will give freshmen and sophomores two weeks of cuts in all of

their basic courses.

Announcing the new cut system, Dean Pusey emphasized

Next Freshman
Class Admitted;
350 Will Enter

Three Merit Winners
In Class of 1969;
Assistance Increased

By WALTER BORDA

James Farrar, Dean of Admissions,
announced yesterday that 350 appli-
cations for the class of ‘69 have ac-
cepted offers of admission. The Com-
mittee on Admissions passed favor-
ably on 630 applications from the
1550 they received.

The Committee on Admissions con-
sists of Deans Atwood, Farrar, Gil-
liam, John, and Professors Barritt,
Coulling, Jarrard, Jenks, Jennings,
Jones, Pinney Ravenhorst, Spencer,
and Stephenson.

For the first time since 1962, Na-
tional Merit Scholarship winners will
be among the entering Freshman
class. Three students will hold these
scholarships. In 1962, there was only
one.

Class Is Strong

Overall statistics on the class have
not yet been catalogued. But Dean
Farrar said, “The entering class is a

particularly strong one and we are,
very happy to have the Merit Schol-

arship winners included in it.”

The College Board SAT scores are
expected to be higher than last year’s
602 verbal and 635 math average.
The average class standing, while
varying from school to school, is
expected to be in the first and sec-

ond quintiles. No change in the
present North-South distribution is
expected.

Scholarships and Loans

“Financial assistance in scholar-
ships and loans has risen thirty per-
cent,” said Dean John, Associate di-
rector of Admissions. This rise is
principally due to a recent anon-
ymous donation toward the Lee
Scholarship program.

Six Baker and ten Lee Scholar-
ships, paying the complete cost of
tuition, were granted. Fifty-seven
students will take part in the grant-
loan program and six others have
received Washington Awards. These
awards are token grants of $100
honoring particularly well-qualified
applicants

Four local high school students
will receive Rockbridge County
grants. These scholarships are spon-
sored by the university and cover
much of tuition costs. To qualify
one must be a resident of Rock-
bridge County and present an ac-
ceptable high school record

Commenting on the financial aid
program, Dean John said, “I am
gratified that we were able to help

as many applicants as we did. In the
past the program has contributed
greatly to maintaining the high
quality of the student body, and I
expect it to continue doing is in
the future.”

*that the new absence regulations will

become effective in September 1965.
He urged all students to continue to
adhere carefully to the present re-
strictions which will be enforced
during the remaining days of this
semester.

Courses and Degrees Committee

The revised absence regulations
came as a direct result of action ini-
tiated by the Faculty at its April
session. During its meeting last
month, the Faculty requested the
Committee on Courses and Degrees
to draft a plan for an undated sys-
tem restricting absences.

Commenting on the new faculty-
approved cut system, Dean Pusey,
Committee Chairman, stated: “Un-
der the new absence regulations
next, students who can determine
their own class attendance will have
to take more personal responsibility
for their education.”

According to the new system, there
will be a retention of both Dean's
List and Honor Roll privileges and
of the present system of absences in
physical education. Consequently,
all students, with the exception of
those on the Dean’s List anad Hon-
or Roll, are still prohibited from
taking unexcused cuts before and
after holidays.

While they will be allowed un-
limited cuts in courses numbered
above 200, freshmen and sophomores
will be permitted twice as many ab-
sences in each course below 200 as

 

there are class meetings of the
course per week. Juniors and sen-
iors will be able to determine their

(class attendance in all courses.

Make Us Work

Under the new regulations, a stu-
dent will not be allowed to make
up assigned work except in case of
illness or emergency, unless advance
arrangement is made with his pro-
fessor. Also, any professor who con-
siders that cuts have contributed
materially to unsatisfactory work on
the part of any student may request
the appropriate dean to revoke the
student's absence privileges in his
course.

Each unexcused absence will be
penalized by the deduction of one
quality credit and one grade point
from a student's semester and cum-
ulative grade-point ratio. This pen-
alty will be subject to immedite
appeal to the Absence Committee.

Sentiment among the Faculty gen-
erally reflects the hope that this new
plan will not only encourage per-
sonal responsibility on the part of
the individual student, but will also
generate a more spontaneous inter-
est in learning among the student
body.

4 New Challenge

It was just a little over a year and a half ago that the
faculty adopted what was then considered a relatively
liberal absence policy. At that time a great deal was said
about the maturity and sense of responsibility present
within the student body. Once again the faculty after
extensive and comprehensive analysis ratified an extreme-
ly liberal cut system which we feel eliminates many of the
weaknesses of the previous policy. At the same time it is
incumbent upon the student body to assume the burden
which the new system places on them.

The revised system leaves to the professor an oppor-
tunity to exercise a great deal of discretion while offering
considerable freedom to the responsible student. Ic is still
the prerogative of any faculty member to set absence reg-
ulations for individuals or entire classes if he feels that
non-attendance contributes to failure. The degree to
which professors are forced to revoke absence privileges
will, of course, depend on the willingness of students to
demonstrate a real measure of self discipline in the con-
duct of their absence habits.

Perhaps the most pleasing aspect of the new absence
policy is the elimination of the F penalty for overcutting.
This rule has been the subject of extensive debate among
faculty as well as students. Just two weeks ago the
Executive Committee submitted a recommendation to the
Committee on Courses and Degrees indicating its desire
to substitute the reduction of quality credits for the F
penalty. The new policy on overcuts employs not only
the E.C. proposal but in addition it further penalizes the
violator by reducing quantity credits. Although some may
view this modification as insignificant, we feel strongly
that it is a vast improvement over the previous policy.

Undoubtedly, students will be disappointed to note
that the new policy retains some traditionally unpopular
regulations. The P.E. department still remains protected
from the absence system under which the rest of Univer-
sity operates. Cutting before and after holidays is limited
to Dean’s List and Honor Roll students as well as certain
second semester seniors. Also, sophomores may find that
under the new system they actually have fewer excused
absences. In spite of these limitations, it is hard to antici-
pate anything but the most wholehearted and overwhelm-
ing endorsement of the student body.

One final warning should be issued in connection with
the liberalization of the absence regulations. The new
policy does not go into effect until next semester includ-
ing the revised overcut penalty. For this reason it is im-
perative that strict adherence to the present system be
maintained. Surely the promise of increased academic
freedom warrants further evidence of maturity and judg-
ment on the part of all.

The Ring-tum Phi encourages the student body to
examine carefully the opportunities and_ responsibilities
offered in this revised system. Failure of the student body
to live up to faculty expectations will certainly result in
a reversal of the present trend toward academic freedom.

Opportunity For Improvement

The McCormick Library is probably one of the most
talked about and yet least known institutions on this
campus. Faculty and students alike systematically degrade
and belittle the services of the library. Unfortunately, all
too little is known about the financial resources or actual
content of our library. In addition to these ignorances,
the Student Library Committee realizes very little of its
potential as a constructive force in initiating positive re-
forms.

It is implausible and indeed inaccurate to judge a
library by statistical data, however conclusive it may be.
Numerical content is only one criterion by which the ade-
quacy or inadequacy of a library should be judged. The
endowment of the University plays a large part in the
limitations which confront the library. It should be
pointed out that the budget of the library has been in-
creasing every year, and that by 1970 the University in-
tends to at least double the present allocation.

Notwithstanding the financial limitations of our libra-
ry, there are certain areas in which long-needed improve-
ment can and should take place. One of these areas is
the unnecessarily involved process of checking out a book
The difficulties inherent in the present system are most
apparent when a student must check out a large number
of volumes for a paper. Certainly some streamlined and
more efficient method can be implemented without dis-
rupting the operation of the library.

There is really no reason why the stacks could not

 

remain open at least during the supper hour. It is dis
concerting, to say the least, to be in the midst of a paper
and then be forced to leave the stacks and reference ma
terial for a period of over two hours. If the Honor Sys-
tem operates in the use of other facilities on this campus,
it would seem that students could be allowed fo remain
in the stacks without the supervision of an attendant.

The Student Library Committee is definitely

instated a lazy slob.

Human Factor

The tragedy in this process was
the complete absence of the human
factor. The members of the com-
mittee may have been big hearted
and the nicest guys in the world.
They may have been crying their
eyes out in the committee room.
Nevertheless, any well oiled machine
could have come up with the same
results.

The standards of academic excel-
lence at Washington and Lee are
soaring, but nevertheless it will nev-
er be able to match Harvard or Yale,
Nobel Prize winner for Nobel Prize
winner. However, there is one asset
W&L can offer a student which
Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and Berk-
eley can never offer: W&L is
small enough to give each student
individual attention and _ concern.
We should make the most of this
asset.

Large Schools More Concerned

Ironically, the larger schools show
more concern for their individual
students than W&L in the way they
determine who must go. Harvard,
Yale, Stanford, and Dartmouth have
the philosophy that any student who
has the qualifications to be at their
school is a superior student worth
salvaging.

While Washington and Lee boots
out 15% of its student body accord-
ing to the Comparative Guide to
American Colleges, these five other
schools almost take the attitude of
refusing to let go of any student
without first putting up a fight. The
expulsion rates range from a low at
Stanford of 2% over a period of four
years to a high at Dartmouth of 10%
(incidentally, the rate is similarly
low at the good small schools: 2%
of Pomona’s students must leave for
academic reasons, 3% leave at Wes-
leyan, 4% at Amherst and at Wil-
liams, and 5% at Davidson).

Perhaps back in the era of play-
boys and hell raisers when any fool
with money could get into college
these rules were needed. Today,
however, Washington and Lee's
policy should reflect the high quality
of its students. If 15% of the student

Hard and Fast Rules

Now, I am not saying that Wash-

stay and become a haven for lazy
geniuses. It just seems to me that
expulsion or suspension should be
based on a study of each individual’s
capabilities, performance, and poten-
tial; not upon a hard and fast rule.
The committee may claim that the
rule is not hard and fast, that a
number of students are re-instated.
Nevertheless, no matter how many
individual cases were supposedly
considered, re-instatements were giv-
en students primarily by lowering
the cutoff point.

Student Hotdog Cuts No Mustard

Climbs Side Of Science Building

(Continued from page 2)

slimey, viscous substance on his
hands and knees. Says his main goal
in life is the west wall of the New
York Stock Exchange. Likes warm,
dry places. Had planned to attend
college in Mexico somewhere near
the border, but my description of
Virginia has won him over to our
side for the time being.
—Dean Blitzgrieg.

“Come down, you weenie!” A
large group of students had crowd-
ed around the science building by
the time Dean Rodriguez arrived.
About half-way up one wall he
spotted Hotdog, humming and rub-
bing his hands together.

“Now listen, Hotdog! I don’t relish
the idea of calling the fire depart-
ment! But if you don’t come down
right now, I'll be forced into it!”

Hotdog spit noisily and climbed
even higher.

“No flies on him!” The attitude of
the mob had made an abrupt change.
The freshman had deliberately dis-
obeyed the Dean’s order.

Rodriguez took a quick puff on his
cigarette, then threw it away. “All
right. Call in the fire department.”

A nightmarish scene followed. In
the dark, all around the foot of the
Science Building, stood policemen,
students, members of the faculty,
firemen, hundreds of townspeople
who had been awakened by the
sirens and shouting. Up above them,
framed in the beam of a spotlight,
was Hotdog, motionless except for
an occasional discharge of spittle, his
body pressed tightly against the
brick wall.

“It's no use! We don’t have a
ladder long enough to reach him!”
The fire chief threw up his hands,
then shoved them into his pockets.

“What about the hoses?” Dean
Rodriguez leaned over and pulled up
a big clump of grass, stuffed it into
his mouth and began chewing on it
nervously.

From here on Heumann took over and

In the final round Washington Uni-

W&L down to defeat, 10-3. Although
playing sound ball in this contest also,
the Generals were no match for this

“Still no good. They’d wash him
right off the wall. He’d survive the
fall. But if you want, we can go
ahead and—”

“No, no!” It was Dr. Leipzig of
the biology department who came
running over, waving his arms.
“You must take it alive at all costs!
Think what it will mean to science
if we ean only capture it alive, Herr
Rodriguez! The things it can teach
us! It is obviously of a far superior
intell—”

“I don’t think you fully under-
stand the situation, Dr. Leipzig. If
you'll just—”

“I’ve got it!” The fire chief snap-
ped his fingers. “We'll use one of
the foam extinguishers. He won't
stay up there long once he’s cov-
ered with all that gook!”

The fire chief was right. Too right.
Hotdog began screaming and quiver-
ing as soon as the foam spray hit
his body, then, clawing at his
spiracles, he fell ninety feet to his
death and shriveled into a ball.

“Well how about it, Dean Rodri-
guez? Was it a W&L man or not?”
The Times-Dispatch reporter held|
his pencil poised over his note pad. |

Rodriguez nudged Hotdog’s re-
mains with the toe of his slipper,
then turned to face the Blue Ridge
mountains, just becoming visible in
the dawn light. “Son, that’s some-|
thing none of us will ever know.”

Yale’s catalogue is equally non-
committtal; “At any point during the
college year a student may be drop-
ped from the college if, in the opin-
ion of the faculty, the student’s rec-
ord is sufficiently unsatisfactory.”

Pomona College has a _ system
worth studying. A Joint Committee
of the college views the work of
every student whose average is be-
low a “C.” According to acting Dean
of Students Shelton L. Beatty, “Be-
fore the Joint Committee meets each
semester, the student’s dean studies
his record with eare, often has in-
terviewed the student and his fac-;
ulty advisor, and also his upperclass |
sponsor if he is a freshman, plus|
the student's new schedule and,
choice of concentration to discover |
how to help the student succeed,|
and to gauge what action should be
recommended to the Joint Commit-
tee.”

Most students are given a warn-

Henry then gets news of the Arch-

begs Henry not to carry out this ap-

pleadings of sanity.

Becket assumes the position
against his will, fearful that the
will confront something that he
will not be able to overcome iwth
a well-turned phrase. Appre-
hensively, he begins his duties
and is soon confronted wtih the
problem of excommunicating one
of the king's nobles.

The remaining half of the movie
deals with the conflict between two

ing. If the deficiencies are more
serious, a student is put on proba-
tion. In a few cases the committee
advises a _ student to withdraw.
However, “If the student, after con-
sidering his status, should decide not
to withdraw, he may continue on
probation.”

In the most serious cases, accord-
ing to Dean Beatty, “If the student
lies down on the job and really
shows no intention of working to
save himself, or if his situation looks
nearly hopeless, we thoroughly
study his case, and in the few in-
request (i.e. require) him
to withdraw.”

Thus the committee at Pomona
has a much more difficult job than
its counterpart at W&L. The com-
mittee members can’t hide behind a
bureaucratic shield and say, “I’m
sorry, but there's nothing we can do.
We've got to uphold the rules, you

campaign bid for the Illinois gover-
ship, his first plunge into active poli-
tics.

“Your day just never ends,” he said.
“‘T've never seen anything like it in
business.”

He said that even though he was
defeated, the campaign brought about
some changes in Illinois. He cited the
initiation of a “literacy” retaining pro-
gram giving school dropouts a second
chance to further their education,
increased state support of education,
bipartican support of industrial devel-
opment and the beginnings of reform
legislation to purge criminal elements
in Cook County and Chicago.

Commenting on the future of the
national Republican party, Percy said
that “because we are in the minority,
we have to be a party that proposes,
not just one that opposes. We must be
a party of good ideas.” Percy said the

to remain. The Royal Lao govern-
ment opened the areas under its
control to all Laotian factions and
to the International Control Com-
mission. The Communists on the
other hand have forbidden access to
the areas under their control, not
only to the Prime Minister of Laos,
but to the International Control
Commission.

Domnio Theory

The domino thedry which states
that if we lose Viet-Nam, the other
nations of Asia will follow, is held
by many of our top military and
diplomatic leaders. The United
States must make a stand some-
where, and it will be easier now than
later. As Mr, Charles Percy said
here on Friday, patience is the key
to victory in South Viet-Nam.

The situation is incredibly com-
plex and may grow more so before
a final solution is reached. It seems
to me, however, that our govern-
ment must make one of two choices.
We can either continue to aid the
people of South Viet-Nam in an at-
tempt to protect thir freedom, or
we can negotiate a withdrawal on
the condition that Hanoi and the Red
Chinese stop aiding the rebels thus
enabling the Communists to gain an-
other foothold in Indonesia.

James DeYoung Receives

Frank J.

James DeYoung, Phi Kap senior
from Kenilworth, Illinois, received
the Frank J. Gilliam Award Wed-|
nesday night as graduating seniors,
members of the Alumni Association,
feculty, and guests filled Evans Din-|
ing Hall for the 26th annual Senior
Banquet.

The award was established in 1963)
by the Executive Committee in hon-
or of retiring Dean Frank J. Gilliam.
t is given annually to the graduat-
ing senior who, in the opinion of the!
committee, has made the most out-|
standing contributions to Washing-|
ton and Lee, and who exhibits most!
closely the principles and dedication
that characterized Dean Géilliam’s
career with the unversity.

In making the presentation ad-
dress President Cole pointed out that
the selection is made completely
without regard to a candidate’s po-
litical record on campus, and that
it is not necessary to have held any
particular office or belonged to any
particular organizations.

He paid tribute, however, to De
Young’s wide variety of interests as
reflected in his record of extracur-
ricular actiivties, which include
membership in ODK, Pi Sigma
Alpha honorary political science fra-
ternity, and Beta Gamma Sigma
honorary commerce school fraternity.
He has also served as president of
Phi Kappa Sigma, captain of the
varsity tennis team, business man-
ager of the Southern Collegian, and
a member of the Student Service
Society and Student War Memorial
Scholarship Fund Committee.

In reply, DeYoung said: “I am
deeply honored in receiving this
award. But I am also mindful of
the splendid cooperation of many
others. With humbleness I say,
‘Thank you very much’.”

The winner of the award receives
$100 outright and an additional $150

ideals of the past American presi-
dents Woodrow Wilson and John F.
Kennedy, both of whom advocated
the preparation of a world society
“with a place for divergency.” Thus
the white government of South Af-
rica is dedicated toward the preser-
vation of the white culture located in
the vicinity of the Cape area. And
to accomplish this the government is
enforcing a program of “vertical de-
velopment” which will theoretically
allow each culture to develop to its
highest potential without contami-
nating others.

In this light, Mr. Winsled went on
to say, it is unreasonable for the
world to expect such policies as in-
tegration or universal suffrage to be
embraced by South Africa. For, al-
though existing international opinion
frowns on the idea of one sociologi-
eal group dominating another, no
other course of action would be feas-
ible in a society whose economy is
run and directed by a white popu-
lace which finds itself outnumbered
five to one. If, Mr. Winsled contin-
ued, South Africa believed that it
allow integration without the
of the white culture, it}
would gladly do However, the

several changes in procedure for
Rush Week next fall were made, with
minor wording changes in the Inter-
fraternity Council constitution also

accepted.
In place of three of the six Open
Houses scheduled for Monday of

Rush Week, two “Open Rush Dates”
will be held in the afternoon. These
“Open Rush Dates” will be much
like Open Houses, except that beer
may be served, and each will last
ifor an hour and fifteen minutes.
| Their purpose is to give freshmen
who are not satisfied with or not
asked back to the fraternities they
saw on previous Open Houses a
chance to see at least one other.
Each fraternity is required to hold
jone “Open Rush Date”, with the
second being optional.

Another rush change will add a
third hour of Open Dorm Rush, to
be held on Sunday of Rush Week
from 12:55 to 1:55. Open Dorm Rush

The Eternal Juke

Ten pledges stand before the hypnotic
monster which emits jarring shrieks. The
shrieks of the Machine are matched only by
those of the hypnotized.

“Juke! Juke! Juke!”

“Through its emphasis in the liberal arts
and sciences, Washington and Lee’s curricu-
lum tends to involve studies that free the
mind, lead to understanding, create humility
and tolerance, and afford a basis for continu-
ing study and learning.” — Washington and
Lee catalogue, page 14.

A strange yet true syllogism emerges some-
what like this: Socialism is considered a liberal
tendency. Wé&L is considered a conservative
school. Yet W&L is socialistic in the worst
connotation of that term.

Social Initiative

“No one attends the University who does
not become aware of new dimensions of gen-
tlemanly conduct and honor whose traditions
stem from when General Robert E. Lee was
president of the institution.”” — Washington
and Lee catalogue, page 15.

W&L is a killer of initiative.

First, W&L is a killer of social initiative.
One wonders what the W&L man did before
the combo party and bourbon. One wonders
how the self-perpetuating social animal could
ever have been otherwise than it is now. Our
mores, values and social ethics were defined
for us long before we entered as freshmen.
Freshman camp was the indoctrinary starting-
point of a long assembly-line complete with
the Osmotic Committee, Jack Daniels, and a
Playboy sexual attitude which is representa-
tive of our consideration and treatment of
other people and things.

The freshman sees the sophomore and
molds himself after the upperclassman. That
current sophomore saw this year’s junior last
year, who in turn saw the sophomore before
him, now a senior. And so the perpetual mo-
tion Machine reproduces itself in a giant self-
carnivorous circle. The fact that this circle
cannot, or at least has not, liberated itself, is
a proof of our lack of social and ethical ini-
tiative.

We live in a James Bond world at W&L.
We have no open values or enthusiasms other
than sex, booze and non-involvement. James
Bond attains the level of a god. We may
laugh at his exaggerated sophisticate values,
but we will return from the movie to emulate
them. Just as in Bond movies, it is the image
that is important, the image of a hollow, self-
conscious “individual.” Just as Bond is self-
consciously aware of his image, we too are
concerned in projecting the social impression.

If you do not believe it, consider the pride
you take in preparing for a quiz with less ef.-
fort and time than your classmates. We lack
spontaneity, initiative, drive. We even get
drunk in a self-conscious way. The image is
ever before us, and we preserve the image.
We are afraid to criticize, to analyze, to ques-
tion. We are afraid to break out of the social
mold that has come to dominate W&L life.

The reason we consider the social first is
because this is the essence, the hub around
which everything else revolves. Many of the
social aspects are not inherently evil, but in
the conformity in which their uniformity ex-
presses itself, they crowd out and overshadow
more important considerations and responsi-
bilities.

Intellectual Responsibility

ef

in the course of four years he is
confronted with much basic knowledge that is
of inestimable value, no matter what his ulti-
mate role in society may be. But he also im-
proves his ability to think — deliberately, crit-
ically, and analytically. He develops new
powers of reasoning that enable him to arrive
at sound, defensible conclusions. He learns
where to seek answers to questions and prob.
lems. And through it all, he is drawn ‘into
fuller and deeper life,’ the good college en-
gendering in him ‘processes of learning’ that
are continued throughout his lifetime’ —
Washington and Lee catalogue, page 15.
Perhaps the first of these is the intellec-
tual. We are ashamed of working hard and
therefore doing well. We are not ashamed of

working superficially and doing well. In our
world the “pursuit of learning’’ lacks integ-
rity. If anything, we pay mere lip-service to
the intellectual. Our social syndrome is partly
the culprit here, but neither is the classroom
exempt from criticism. We are not allowed to
immerse ourselves in personally valid educa-
tion. Instead, we are given lists to memorize
and facts to be regurgitated. We are not given
responsibility to learn for and by ourselves
with the guidance of a professor. Because we
do not have this responsibility and because
memorization leaves little time for reflection
and pursuing personal curiosity, our sense of
intellectual responsibility withers. Our leth-
argy is a cause of our professors frustrations,
but their methods are, conversely, the causes
of our lethargy. We the students, and more
importantly, the administration, refuse to ques-
tion our faculty. Our faculty refuses to de-
mand a personal learning for fear of losing
their sacred lists in advocating the philosophy
of “no think.”

And what do we return to? The same
cancerous cycle, not the progress of a straight
line. If we are not given the responsibility, we |

lackadaisically accept the lack of responsibility, || R

we slip into a socialistic world devoid of intel-
lectual initiative.

Religious Non-Involvement

“The second ‘enduring adherence’ of the
University is its dedication to the Christian
Ideal.” —- Washington and Lee catalogue,
page 16.

The third area, so much less in vogue
than the social or even the intellectual, is the
religious. Fully aware that the rest of this
paragraph will go unread, we hold that this,
itself, is the most striking example of our un-
willingness to examine, to step out of the
norm, to consider something more important
than the latest flick. Many of us may priv-
ately hold beliefs, but because we are afraid
of social ostracization, we discount, or hold,
these beliefs in shame. We have put the
purely social above religious conviction.

It is fashionable, intellectually and otherwise,
to believe that God is dead. We demand a
tangible proof which is in itself evident that
we understand little of subjective matters,
much less faith. We label each other “lizards”
if we maintain a belief, simply because relig-
ious conviction is held to be powerless and
unsophisticated. Someone once said, “For
I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ for
it is the power of God unto salvation to every-
one who believes.”

Who among us will maintain that we do
not need salvation, if “only” from ourselves?
Institutional Pride

We show wide-spread stagnation in our
institutional pride. We have moved in to a
cocoon of self-centered existence and fear
showing any pride and allegiance to our Uni-
versity. In continually damning our institution
and its leaders, we fail to present any alterna-
tives to our present situation. We fail in two
respects. First, little or no thought is integrat-
ed into ideas we may have; and, secondly, if
our basic premises are sound we lack the
initiative and drive to stand up for what is
tight. Those who do possess this quality are
immediately labeled as true self-centered ego-
tists who are out for themselves. Consequent-
ly, progress in the true sense of the word is
forced from our minds, whether we wish to
admit it or not.

A student at W&L has two responsibili-
ties. He has a responsibility to himself to gain
the best education possible; more importantly,
however, he has a responsibility to the Uni-
versity.

A university can be no better than the peo-
ple who inhabit its academic environment.
Therefore, if W&L is to ever become a
“Great’ institution, it will require the efforts
of its students, faculty and administration.

Ten seniors stood before the provincial
god of lack of initiative. Ten seniors bowed
down to social conformity, intellectual stulti-
fication, and religious unconcern. Ten sen-
iors refused to analyze, to question, to be in-
volved. Ten seniors shrieked, “W&L! W&L!

 

Professor Publishes Rat Results

 

Dr. Jarrard Studies Rat Brain Damage

A Washington and Lee professor
and one hundred fifty rats are the
principals in a series of experiments
being conducted in duPont Hall, in
an attempt to determine how brain
functions control behavior patterns
in animals and in man. Dr. Leon-
ard E. Jarrard, professor of psy-
chology, discussing his research ear-
lier this week, commented that while
all work done thus far has been
“strictly experimental”, the results
have been encouraging, and that
continued experimentation should
significantly increase our knowledge
in the field of neuro-psychology.

For the past three years, Dr. Jar-
rard and several Robert E. Lee Re-
search Scholars have been testing
the effects of various types of brain
damage on the rats, with recent em-
phasis on the hippocampus, a rela-
tively small brain area, centrally lo-
cated, and of uncertain functions.
These experiments, Dr. Jarrard
noted, have apparently discredited

 

one theory that the hippocampus
controls short term memory; his re-
search has shown that it seems to
influence several different types of
functions.

This spring, experiments have been
conducted using an unusually com-
plex apparatus called “Operant Con-
ditioning Equipment”, which releas-
es food pellets to the rats at ran-
dom times as the rats press bars
in their cages. Not each press will
release a pellet; the rats must learn
to keep pressing the bar. The learn-
ing times of normal control rats
are compared with those for rats
with brain damage resulting from
the administration of drugs and from
removal of various parts.

Other work has concerned “taste
threshholds.” The rats are placed in
cages containing identical dishes,
one of water and the other of water
mixed with quinine. As the rats
learn to avoid the bitter quinine, it

 

 

is further diluted, to the point where

they are unable to notice the taste.
Again, the “taste threshholds” of
control rats are compared with those
for the injured rats.

Records are kept of the effects of
brain damage on the basic, “instinc-
tive” body functions of the animals.
They are observed day and night,
and times spent on every activity
are noted,

These experiments have been
sponsored under the National Sci-
ence Foundation Undergraduate Re-
search Participation Program. On
leave next year, Dr. Jarrard will
continue his research at the Univer-
sity of Florida College of Medicine,
under a National Institute of Health
Special Fellowship. Florida’s school
of medicine, noted for its neuro-
anatomy-physiology programs, is the
center in the South for epilepsy pa-
tients and conducts extensive brain
surgery; Dr. Jarrard plans to check
his theories at the human level there.
He pointed out that while animal
experimentation is a necessary start-
ing-point in such research, results
cannot always be generalized to a
human level, and that next year’s
study will therefore be essential.

A graduate of Carnegie Institute of
Technology in Pittsburgh, Dr. Jar-
rard has long believed in the use-
fulness of student participation in
research. When he came to W&L in
1959, he was engaged in research on
the effflects of radiation on animals.
He recalled that at first, his research
“was not too popular.” Now he has
more applications for research as-
sistantships than he can use. This
year, he has been aided by Robert
E. Lee, Ill, Ken Marion, Ralph O’-
Connor, and Andy Smith. Remain-
ing at W&L this summer to continue
work with the rats will be Smith,
Roger Sphar, and C. B. Manning.
Dr. Jarrard feels that such student
research invaluable in showing
students all that is involved in the
study of one small area of psychol-
ogy.

Preliminary results of Dr. Jar-
rard’s research have been published
in numerous American and interna-
tional journals of psychology. Earlier
this year, he delivered papers at
meetings in Atlanta and Chicago.
Each of his students, last week, gave

Stickmen End Season

 

In Loss To Virginia

By KIP ARMSTRONG
The varsity lacrosse team ended
its season Wednesday with an out-
standing losing effort against arch-

rival Virginia on Wilson Field. The}

final score was 12-7.

The seniors on the team — tri-
captains Michaeles, Pat Robertson,
and Klingelhofer, goalies Morgan

and West, and middie Jackson (who
will play next year as a law stu-
dent) all climaxed fine lacrosse ca-
reers at W&L with outstanding con-
tributions in their final game as Gen-
erals. It was evident throughout the
game that the Generals had their
hearts in this one — they wanted
a win badly — and as Coach Swan
said, “They almost pulled it off.”
The Generals opened the scoring
with two minutes .gone as Frost
found Klingelhofer open, and Car-
roll fired it by Brandt. The Virginia
team stung back a minute later, as
mid-fielder Stewart tallied two goals,
and the Wahoos added two more to
give them a 4-1 quarter lead. The
game was closer in the second pe-
riod, as the Blue traded goals with
the vistiors until late in the period,

final goals to bring the margin to
12-7 when the gun sounded.

The conditioning and speed of the
small General team was clearly evi-

Dickinson Named Next
Year’s Tennis Captain

George Forrest Dickinson, a junior
from Loretto, Virginia, has been se~-
lected tennis captain for the 1965-66
school year. The action came this
week after this year’s squad closed
jout the season Tuesday with a 6-3
| victory over Randolph-Macon.
| For Dickinson, a member of Phi
Kappa Sigma, this was his third year
|on the tennis squad. For most of
the season he played number three
singles, but for the last match
against Randolph-Macon he played
number two singles behind Jim De
Young. Dickinson also played on the
doubles team.

Commenting on his selection as
captain, Coach Verne Canfield ex-
pressed the belief that Dickinson

 

“will make a very good captain.”

when McGill put Virginia ahead 8-4. ;

Bruce Jackson scored on an extra-
man play, and Klingelhofer and
Daesener got the other
goals in the second quarter.
Bowersox, who played his finest

game of the season, controlled the

opening face-off of the second half,
and the stickmen scored quickly on
a goal by Pittman. Michaeles cut
the margin to two with a_ well-
placed shot at 2:04 of the third quar-
ter. Virginia stormed back to lead
my three.

Klingelhofer tallied the final goal
on a fantastic shot in the upper left
hand corner one inch from the edge
of the net. At 7:40, Prusmack of
U.Va. was given a two mintue rest
when he swung at Billy Andrews in
retaliation for a beautiful block. In

Netters Defeat

Washington and Lee’s varsity ten-
nis squad closed out its 1965 season
Tuesday afternoon with a 6-3 vic-
tory over the Randolph-Macon net-
ters.

The General victory was primarily
a result of the squad’s superb dou-
bles play, with W&lL sweeping all
three doubles matches after breaking
even in six singles matches.

Victories in singles play were
picked up by Lindsey Short over
Scott Hanson, 6-3, 6-3; by Phil
Thompson over Tom Hodges, 6-3,
8-6; and by Fred Webb over Len
Harper, 7-5, 6-1. Jim DeYoung lost
his singles match to Monroe Baisden,
6-1, 2-6, 9-7. Other defeats for W&L
came when John Wolff downed For-
rest Dickinson, 6-2, 5-7, 6-3, and
when Ed Kellogg picked up a win
over Howard Busse, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4.

In the doubles competition, the
team of Short and Dickinson defeat-
ed Baisden and Hanson, 7-5, 6-1
DeYoung and Thompson then
teamed up for a 6-3, 6-1 victory over
Wolff and Hodges. Webb and Dick
Crook won the final doubles match
over Turner and Kellogg, 6-2, 6-3.

With the victory over Randolph-
Macon the Generals ran their ree-
ord to 5-1 in dual meets. They were
0-3 in the tournament competition

so the final overall record for W&L
is 5-4,

Coach Verne Canfield, after the
final game, said it was an odd sea-
son. He pointed out the Generals
went from comparatively easy
matches like the ones against Bridge-
water and Lynchburg, to real tough
competition in the Cherry Blossom
Tournament. On the whole, he felt
the team had a pretty good season.

Looking ahead to next year, Can-
field
team which compiled a 4-2 record
this year. Particularly outstanding
on the frosh squad was Wick Vell-
ines, although Canfield added there
were about ten on the squad who
all played good ball.

Canfield also said that the num-
ber two high school player in the
state of Virginia has enrolled at
Washington and Lee for next year.
He is Tom Rueger of Virginia Beach.
Canfield said he should be able to
make the varsity squad.

Three letter winners will be back
from this year’s squad. They are
captain-elect Forrest Dickinson, Phil
Thompson, and Dick Crook. Can-
field added that they should provide
the nucleus for a good team next

Basketball Chances Improve
As 33 Prep Players Enroll

the person, who, in the opinion of |

Head basketball coach Verne Can-
field is a happy man these days.
This is highly unusual for a coach
whose teams dropped seventeen of
nineteen starts last season. But Can-
field has 33 good reasons for optim-
ism hanging on the bulletin board in
his office. On 3 by 5 index cards,
he has recorded the names, heights,
weights, positions and College Board
scores of 33 topnotch freshmen who
have confirmed acceptance at W&L
for next year.

Coach Canfield has attracted the
33 by means of fifteen trips through
nine states, a weekly newsletter, and
over 1,000 personal letters and tele-
grams.

“All the boys with whom I talked

play just about every game this
year and was very impressed with
his rebounding ability. In the Dis-
trict tournament, Earl pulled down
84 rebounds in three games.”

Others with a good shot at making
the varsity are 6-4 Rick Lohrman
from Webster, New York, Rob
Bauer, 6-1, from Pensacola, Florida,
and 6-2 Jim Philpott of Lexington,
North Carolina. All three have won
All-Conference or All-District hon-
ors this last year.

were very serious about their edu-
cation,” he says. “I had very little|
trouble selling them W&L on this|
point.” |
“I also told them that they would
be taking part in an extensive bas-
ketball improvement program while
working on their education. I men-
tioned that there would be three
coaches working with them next
year and that we would have an im-
proved and more practical schedule
including a December trip to Flor-
ida.”

“T told them that in years to come
we will include more games and
tournaments in out-of-state areas
such as Kentucky, Tennessee, and
Connecticut.”

Next year’s prospects come from
16 states. 23 of them are over the
six-foot level, with size ranging
from 6-5, 200 pound Earl Edwards
of Lexington down to Gil Fitzhugh
of McLean at 5-8 and 150 pounds.
College Board scores average out to
587 verbal and 627 in math.

Asked if 33 freshmen would be
too many, Canfield said that some of
the prospects had a chance to play
with the varsity next year to fill the

 

lacrosse team ended the season Mon-
day with a 9-5 loss to the University
of Virginia.

The Baby Generals held a 2-1 lead
after one quarter, but the Cavaliers
stormed back in the second period to
take the lead 5-3.

Washington and Lee’s goals were
scored by Dave Johnson, Kester
Denman, Lars Holtan and Cris
Hart. Hart scored two.

The Generals finished the season
with a 2-6 record, but according to
coach Bob Van Rensselaer the team
was just beginning to come along.

Van Rensselaer said that the last
two games were the best because the
team finally started to click on of-
fense. “Offense only comes with ex-
perienced stick handlers and the last
two games showed vast improve-
ment,” stated the coach.

Cris Hart lead the freshman team
in goals for the year with 14. Griffin
lead in assists, while Harold Stowe
and Bruce Commander received par-
ticular praise for good, consistent
defense throughout the season. Van
Rensselaer called Kester Denman
the best all-around midfielder, of-

we want Conventional Dress, and,
if so, do we want it backed up by
an Assimilation Committee. You see,
the ultimate decision lies with us. If
we decide to allow each student to
dress according to his own taste,
then that decision is final — the fac-
ulty ean do nothing about it. Brown
underestimates the power of the stu-
dent body and the interest that can
aroused in them concerning cru-
cial issues. What does he think we
are — a mass of warm bodies just
ready to accept whatever the faculty
hands down? Be serious, man;
there’s more to us than that. Inci-
dentally, if students here were to
become genuinely interested in the
academic side of the university, then
their interest in the University as a
whole would be enhanced. There-
fore, they could easily be incited
to take issue with the faculty if the
latter were to hand down a decision
such as the one Brown indicates
they're currently considering. (1
wonder if this is what the faculty
fears by considering taking student
dress into their hands). So I guess
Brown loses out on all sides.

This is the situation. I feel that the|

them at least publicly and honestly
state the reasons for this.

dent as they outhustled and domi-
nated the visitors time and again but
failed to shoot often enough (only
21 shots to the visitors’ 48). Butch

West was fantastic in the goal, and! delivered the opening speech,

as Coach Swan said, “In the goal,
Butch definitely stood as tall as any
of their All-Americans.’ He made
a season high of 21 saves, stopping
numerous shots from tall attackmen
coming around the corner of the net

and hard bounce shots from the
mid-fielders.
They led their opponents in

“Open Rush?”

To the Ring-tum Phi:

It's come to our attention that the
LF.C. is continuing its policy of
publishing two separate lists of in-
coming freshmen — one Jewish, the
other Christian. Why should this
be necessary? How can the LF.C.
sanction an open rush program and
at the same time negate the possibil-
ity of accomplishing this? Is not the
LF.C. simply condoning the perpetu-
ation of an intolerably hypocritical
and prejudicial system of discrimina-
tion, whose ultimate purpose is the
obvious exclusion of an otherwise
anonymous group from membership
in the vast majority of fraternities?

We feel that Washington and Lee
has progressed to the point where it
can no longer tolerate such a mor-

Wednesday's banquet began at 6:30
p.m. with an invocation by Dean C.
P. Light of the Law School, followed
by a smorgasbord dinner and a
program of music by the Sazeracs.

Mr. William C. Washburn, secre-
tary of the Alumni Association,
which sponsors the annual dinner,
in
which he emphasized the importance
of the alumni program. “You rep-
resent a link in the chain of Wash-
ington and Lee,” he said, adding
that it was the obligation of every
graduate to help in any way possible
“the thousands of young men who
are coming after you.”

Winsled Clarifies Apartheid

(Continued from page 1)

Winsled called attention to the suc-
cess of vertical development in oth-
er historical instances — notably, the
political policy of modern Switzer-
land and the economic structure of
the German Zollverein prior to 1871.

In closing, Mr. Winsled reiterated
the rights of the white culture to
preserve itself and ended by stating
that South Africa will not knuckle
under to the pressure of world opin-
ion as long as apartheid continues to
be as successful as it is today.

A lively question-and-answer pe-
riod followed, in which the follow-
ing answers were given to random
queries from the audience. “No,

there is no ‘psychosis of fear’ behind |

the enforcement of apartheid.” “The
independent states of the Confeder-
ation will not accept Communist aid

because the Communists cannot
match the 30% of the tax dollar
which South Africa puts into the
development of the states.” “The
United States will not boycott South
Africa because it would be economi-
cally unfeasible” (it appears that
South Africa is the leading producer
of platinum, a metal required in
much space-age production). “No,
there is no anthropological reason
for apartheid. The coloured races
are equally as adept at working in
a mechanized society as the white
man, if not more so, because of his
willingness to learn.”

Conventional Dress: A Rule or a Tradition

Recent referendums dealing with conventional dress and
the Assimilation Committee have stimulated debate not only
in the E.C., but throughout the student body. There is un-
doubtedly widespread disagreement in regard to the role of the
Assimilation Committee in preserving the tradiaion of conven-
tional dress. Last week the new Executive Committee opened
discussion once again on this perennial campus problem, and
after a careful evaluation of the Assimilation Committee and
its current policies decided to suspend the fining power of the
committee beginning next September on a trial basis.

This action has elicited both positive and negative response
from the student body and faculty. A number of persons have
voiced their opposition to this experiment on the grounds that
the decline of convention dress has been the result of a ten-
dency to liberalize enforcement over the past few years. On
the other hand many believe, and we strongly concur, that the
vast majority of the student body would willingly support con-
ventional dress without the petty fining system of the present
Assimilation Committee.

The referendum held last December on conventional dress
and the Assimilation Committee indicated that over 90°) of
those voting favored the tradition of conventional dress while
the policy of the committee itself came under considerable
criticism. Although there were some who urged that the en-
forcement of conventional dress be strengthened, almost all
voters voiced discontent with the present operation of the com-
mittee. If these statistics prove anything it is that the student
body overwhelmingly supports the tradition of conventional
dress and that the student body is dissatisfied with the present
policy of the Assimilation Committee.

In light of these and other factors we applaud the bold
and progressive manner with which the E.C. intends to deal
with this dilemma. Unless the student body is openly hypo-
critical, support for conventional dress need not be based on
a quasi-police organization for which there is little or no re-
spect. In the final analysis the student body will determine
whether it can maintain this valuable tradition without a fining
system for the E.C. will not hesitate to reinstate the full powers
of the Assimilation Committee if it becomes apparent that stu-
dents are irresponsible in the exercise of this freedom.

To those who say that this experiment is idealistic we would
hasten to point out the idealistic foundations of a good many
of our traditions. Certainly, the concensus on this campus
is widespread discontent with the policy of enforcement of con-
ventional dress. Therefore, it is encumbent on the E.C. to give
the student body an opportunity to support this tradition vol-
untarily. Here again the ultimate responsibility lies with the
entire University community. Perhaps much of the idealism
which surrounds the maintenance of conventional dress will be

disspelled this fall — hopefully not.

I have heard many people com-
plain that movies are very fine en-
tertainment, but that they have lit-
tle relation to our daily lives, and
are over when the lights come on,
as if to wake us from some super-
natural fantasy. Here now in “Beck-
et” is some food for thought which
should last quite some time after
you leave the theatre.

I believe this movie asks many
questions and the answers may de-
termine whether you have honor or
not. However you may symbolize
these characters, whether Becket is
a maturing adolescent, a man facing
his master, or a college student thrust
jinto a world shorn of his boying
pleasures and perplexed by the mat-
ter of his personal honor, these
questions, you must decide for your-|
self.

Some of the questions which this
movie asks are as follows:

Henry and Becket first dissociate
when they discuss whether they
are friends or not. Is honor, like
friendship, partially lost er in
question when it has to be dis-
cussed and not simply taken for
granted?

Is morality for you simply an ex-
ercise in ?

(Excerpt from the dairy of Dean
Rodriguez, September 8, 1965)

Dear Dairy:

It is now 3:30 p.m. I've just spent
the entire morning interviewing
members of our incoming freshman
class and I find myself much more
optimistic than in previous years.
I entend to see to it that Dean Blitz-
krieg gets a raise in salary for the
fine job he has done in selecting
what I believe to be our finest fresh-|
men in a decade.

 

They are all, of course, somewhat
eccentric, but that is to be expected
when one takes into consideration
the amazing overall S.A.T average of
the class. As far as their physical ap-|
pearance is concerned I must admit|
that they are not quite as attractive)
personally as our last class, but I
noticed that in matters of dress they
are impeccable. Most of them wore

Briggs Finds Reality In ‘Becket’;
Film Raises Question About Honor

you do it from honesty, or because
of some contrived excuse, as when
Becket gave his mistress to Henry.

Is honor merely a concern of the
living?

How do you reconcile honor and
collaboration?

Do we owe whimsy obedience in

God our in all things
Spiritual?

Can the honor of God be washed
by the public penance of thrashing
or being expelled from school?

Becket is made noble by having
Henry tell him he’s noble. Am I ?

here? Am I honest because people
tell you you are?

In considering our honor system’s
penalty, do we pay as high a price
for being dishonest as Becket paid
for being honest?

I the answer to some of
these questions lies in Becket’s mon-
prayer:

obedience

“Oh, Lord, What do you really
want me to do? To remain p
monk here, in simplicity of spirit?
Is it a path to bring me nearer to
you, or is it too easy a way? I think
it would be too easy to buy you
this way, at a bargain price. ...
I think you mean me to defend
your honor peacefully, Hf I can,
with argument and with com-
promise, and if I cannot, then with
the full challenge of my office and
the searing force of what I know
to be right. I shall take up the
miter again and I shall go back
and fight with the weapons it has
nleased you to give me. In all the
rest, thy will be done.”

over the years has managed to
field one of the nation’s top small
college baseball teams, has man-
aged to do it again with their
1965 edition. On Friday they
clinched the Mason-Dixon title
with a twin victory over Western
Maryland. The Monarchs, who
treated the Generals rather rough-
ly in their visit here this year,

a majority of the fraternities—I be-|
lieve this is called democracy.

I agree, gentlemen, that such prac-
tice is not desirable; but I feel that
the LF.C. has a responsibility to its
members. The fact exists that at least
one fraternity has a clause in its
national laws restricting the pledg-
ing of Jewish boys. Thus, it becomes
a matter of which party do we choose

ginning of the coach’s revitalized
program.

Also Mr, Canfield has brought
the state’s second finest young
tennis player to W&L to play on
the varsity which will be weaken-
ed by graduation. It is for certain
that entering tennis ace Tom Reu-
ger is not anxious for Washing-

to repeat what they ha dsaid.

On the other hand, their responses
to my questions were, to my mind,
indicative of superior intelligence and
a great amount of common sense. In
short, I liked what I saw. They
seemed resless at time, often neglect-
ing to pay attention to what I was
saying. One freshman, for example,

them had hoods to match. The tra-
ditional Weejuns seems to have
been abandoned in favor of a new
type footwear which is lined with
fur (for warmth, I imagine) on the
outside, is leather soled ,and has no
ties (a loafer of some sort). I am
anticipating no trouble with any
more assimilation referendums this

 

hopefully will work their way back
to Yankee Stadium in New York
where they last year won te NCAA
small college division baseball title.

Actually this year they had a
little difficulty about midway
through the season, when after they
had belted a few Ivy League teams
and the University of Virginia,
they traveled to New York State
where they were knocked off
twice by Elmira College. This
started a chain of losses which
put Randolph-Macon in the top
spot of the southern division of the
Mason-Dixon Conference, but the
Monarchs came roaring back to
cop the honors with a late season
rush,

better to have a student who has
on a coat and tie but is intellectual-
ly stagnant, or a student who dress-
es according to his own standard, but
has a genuine interest in what he’s
learning?” To say that all students
who did not have to wear a coat and
tie to class would suddenly be trans-
formed into students chasing around
after “academic excellence” merely
because they are released from the
chains of conventional dress, is, to
use a word Mr. Awad is extremely
fond of, “absurd”.

If it takes an open collar to make

recognize the advantages in looking
their best and already seem to unan-

As I said, they are not quite as at-
tractive as our last class, most of
them being somewhat short in sta-
ture, dark skinned, and with an ex-
cess of body hair, but this can be
explained by the fact that a great
number of them are from the North-
east. I also noticed that a lot of them

I am in favor of conventional dress

the courtesy that students extend
to their professors and to each other.
To say, as some have, that coat and

had the same inquisitive exprecssion,,
the same impatient mannerisms that
I had as a boy and can now see re-
flected on the face of my son, Jaun,
who will be ready for college next
year.

I am looking forward ‘confidently
to an excellent academic year, as
the potential of these new students
is inestimable. I firmly believe that

THE RING-TUM PHI

R-tP Explains Critical View, Praises Facets Of W&L Life

Throughout this school year, the Ring-tum Phi has been)
criticizing various facets of Washington and Lee life. Some-
times we have doubtless seemed too harsh, too vindictive, too
bitter. We have seemed an organ of destructive purpose,
rather than constructive intent.

Why have we bothered? Why have we made an effort to
examine the Washington and Lee situation? I think the pur-
pose of our criticism, its reason, lies within a philosophy of
criticism. We are concerned. Any criticism implies a concern;
criticism, instead of implying bitterness or hatred, actually im-
plies a compliment to the object of our criticism. The target
of our criticism must be worthy of criticism; we must care in
order to criticize.

What is there about Washington and Lee that makes us
care, that makes us concerned, that makes us feel a strong de-
votion to the school? We will make a radical departure from
this year’s editorial policy and examine the elements that have
made us love W&L enough to criticize it so much,

* The Honor System. Much has been said about the
Honor System, perhaps too much. The Honor System gives
order to our lives here and embeds within students a noble
value system. Let us not delude ourselves by making it trite
or commonplace.

* Extensive personal freedom. Washington and Lee has
few petty rules that put irrelevant or insignificant limits on our
freedoms.

%* Personal access to, and relationship with professors. Stu-
dents here are able to have more than a classroom relationship
with professors. All students are able to take advantage of this
valuable opportunity for education unimpeded by the class-
room situation.

* Excellent potential for education. We would not hesi-
tate to match our faculty against any comparable college in the
nation. The facilities and educational tools are available, en-
abling a student to obtain as good an education as he would
find anywhere.

* Social and Academic Balance. Many have complained
that W&L is not co-ed nor is it located in a metropolitan area.
We see this as an implement to academic challenge, recogniz-
ing at the same time that there is no durst of social life at
Wa&L. The two realms — academic and social — exist in a
balance, which is as it should be.

* Administration. We are blessed in having a just and
progressive administration which has escaped the legalistic trap
that many an administration has fallen into. The administra-
tion does a remarkable job of taking the pulse of student body
opinion and accommodating that opinion if they consider it

 

at all feasibly possible.

THOMAS, LTD.

 

* Student Self-government. The existence of a powerful
Executive Committee, Dorm Counselors, the four major com-
mittees (Library, Cold Check, Assimilation, and Control), the
IFC, and an uncensored student newspaper all stand witness
to the extensive power students have in governing themselves.

* Sophisticated, intelligent student body.

Just as this year has been a year of criticism — purposeful
criticism, so it has been a year of growth in many areas:

* Self-Study. The all-inclusive self-study which the Uni-

versity has undertaken, not as a perfunctory duty, but as a
sincere and dedicated effort to investigate Washington and Lee
is evidence of the fact that the faculty and administration are
enthusiastically concerned to discover and improve areas in
which we may be deficient. We are not required to conduct
such a thorough survey as has been planned, but a discovery
of our deficiencies is a prerequisite of their progressive solution.

* Cut System. This year the cut system has been revised
in an effort to increase the student’s responsibility for his own
self-education. This increased freedom places the emphasis of
education upon its desirability rather than on the discipline of
having to go to classes. The revision is not inherently benefi-
cent; it will only be advantageous as students make it. In
loco parentis has been abolished in favor of student responsi-
bility.

%* First Mock Honor Trial. In an effort to clarify any ob-
scurities or mysteriousness surrounding the Honor System, the
EC has held a mock trial in order to explain the procedure of
such a trial. In addition to this, the EC this year has proved
more daring than the large majority of those in the past.

* Integration Barrier. The clarification of the Admissions
policy to the effect that anyone applying to W&L will be given
equal consideration has shown contemporaneousness to be one
of the school’s assets. :

* Political System. Although far from perfect, our politi-.
cal system has progressed from the Boss Tweed days to a more
healthy situation characterized by individual initiative and gen-
eral openness. A candidate must now rely on his own ability
and integrity in order to win an election.

* Contact Weekend. The IFC-sponsored intellectual sym-
posium has been a challenging, successful venture into an area
in which students have not played a motivating role in the past.
It is our prediction that ‘Contact’ will make the most of its
successful initiation to become even more stimulating in the
future.

%* Speakers. Although the number and quality of speak-
ers lecturing on campus has always been one of W&L’s strong
points, this year has proven even better than most with Charles
Percy, Karl Schapiro, Eugene Buttrick, James Silver, Francis
P. Miller, Sir Fitzroy Maclean, and many others all putting
in impressive appearances.

There is much to be proud if at W&L, much that causes
one to feel an attachment to the University. Washington and
Lee is far more worthy of criticism than any amateur efforts
we have been able to make. Washington and Lee has become
a part of us.

An alumnus of Washington and
Lee, Marion S. Sanders (17) of
Wytheville, was insirumental in set-

ting up the special fund to purchase
the memorial books,

The volumes will be placed in the
University’s McCormick Library for
general circulation. Henry Coleman,
present University librarian, said the
money will be used to buy biograph-
ies, “because Miss Annie Jo’s chief
means of interesting students in
reading was to start them on bio-
graphies. She believed the students
would become interested in the per-
son and the times in which he or
she lived, and want to read more
about them and their times.”

“Miss Annie Jo,” University libra-
rian from 1895-1922, perhaps is bet-
ter remembered as the originator of
Washington and Lee’s famous Fancy
Dress Ball. The beginning of “the
South’s best known collegiate social
event” was a small, private party

“Miss Annie Jo“ continued to su-|

pervise arrangements for each Fancy |
Dress Ball until she retired in 1922,
and was an honored guest at each
ball until her death in 1938 at the
age of 85.

Miss White also helped students
stage plays to raise funds to buy
equipment for athletic teams. She
once had the honorary title of “Lady
Vice President of W&L.” Active in
local civic work, she also was in-
strumental in the purchase from
Mrs. Stonewall Jackson of her fam-|

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Includes 3 Merit Scholars

 

Record 350 Frosh Enter

From a record number of 1550 ap-
plicants, 350 high school and prep
school seniors have been chosen to
compose Washington and Lee’s Class
69. The previous record for aup-
plicants was 1480 students set last
year, This year’s acceptance by 350
boys also topped last fall’s 340.

In an announcement earlier this
month, James Farrar, Dean of Ad-
missions, said the Committee on Ad-
missions passed favorably on 630 ap-

i
oO.

plications from the 1550 they had
received.

The Committee on Admissions
consists of Deans Atwood, Farrar,

Gilliam, John, and Professors Bar-
ritt, Coulling, Jarrard, Jenks, Jen-
nings, Jones, Pinney, Ravenhorst,
Spencer and Stephenson.

For the first time since 1962, Na-
tional Merit Scholarship winners will!
be among the entering Freshman
class. Three students will hold these
scholarships. In 1962, there was only |
one.

Class Is Strong

Overall statistics on the class have!
not yet been catalogued, But Dean
Farrar said, “The entering class is a
particularly strong one and we are
very happy to have the Merit Schol-
arship winners included in it.”

The College Board SAT scores are)
expected to be higher than last year’s |
602 verbal and 635 math average.
The average class standing, while!
varying from school to school, is
expected to be in the first and sec-|

| bridge County and present an ac-

present North-South distribution is
expected.
Scholarships and Loans
“Financial in scholar-
ships and loans has risen thirty per-
cent,” said Dean John, Associate di-

assistance

rector of Admissions. This rise is
principally due to a recent anon-
ymous donation toward the Lee

Scholarship program.

Six Baker and ten Lee Scholar-
ships, paying the complete cost of
tuition, were granted. Fifty-seven

students will take part in the grant-
loan program and six others have
received Washington Awards. These
awards are token grants of $100
honoring particularly well-qualified
applicants.

Four local high school students
will receive Rockbridge County
grants. These scholarships are spon-
sored by the university and cover
much of tuition costs. To qualify
one must be a resident of Rock-

ceptable high school record.
Commenting on the financial aid
program, Dean John said, “T am

gratified that we were able to help) ,

as many applicants as we did. In
the past the program has contributed
greatly to maintaining the high
quality of the student body, and I

expect it to continue doing so in|'

 

the future.”
Freshmen will come to Lexington |

on or before September 7.
Freshman camp starts on that date |

Finals President and Vice-Presidents

President Jody Brown, (top left) an SAE from Memphis, has selected
his vice-presidents for this year’s Finals. They are (1 to r) Bill Price,
SAE; Larry Manning, Beta; Joe Bear, Phi Delt; (bottom) Dave Geer, Phi
Delt; Ashley Allen, KA; and Rick Carrell, SAE.

All the veeps are seniors, Brown said that he hoped this year's Finals
would be something to remember. He thought the outdoor concert would
help, especially since Lexington weather has pushed 90 degrees every day
for the past two weeks.

On Thursday the Joe Lynn Quartet, a local group, will play for the
Senior Dance which will be held in Evans Dining Hall.
