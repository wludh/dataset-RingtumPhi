Poet Dickey To Speak
In Contact Symposium

One of the South's most promi-
nent poets and men of letters,
James Dickey, will read and com-
ment on his works to highlights this
year’s ‘Contact’ symposium, Dickey
will appear in Lee Chapel on Fri-
day, March 2, at 8 p.m.

Dickey is perhaps most widely
known for his best selling novel,
Deliverance, a recounting the ad-

ventures of four Atlanta business-
men searching for their manhood
on a wild river canoe trip. The
film version, starring Jon Voight
and Burt Reynolds, with a sereen-
play by Dickey, has been a tre-
mendous box office success, It was

recently nominated for two Academy
Awards, including Best Picture.

Before, Deliverance, Dickey was
primarily known as a poet and lit-
erary critic, Considered by some to
be America’s finest poet, he re-
ceived the National Book Award for
Poetry in 1966 for a collection en-
titled Buckdancer’s Choice. Shortly
after that Dickey was appointed
Consultant on Poetry in English to
the Library of Congress; currently,
he is writer-in-residence at the Uni-
versity of South Carolina,

A native of Atlanta, Georgia,
Dickey began his writing career
while in the Air Force in World

War Il. After the war, he went to
Vanderbilt University and worked
with Robert Penn Warren, In the
fifties, he mixed teaching and ad-

vertising careers, while writing in his

spare time.

After publishing two books of
poetry, Dickey decided to turn to
verse full-time. Since then he has

produced three volumes of poetry,
three books of criticism, and De-
liverance,

Dickey’s last visit to Washington
and Lee was sponsored under the
auspices of the Glasgow Endow-
ment,

Other participants in this year’s
‘Contact’ include: former McGov-
campaign aide Frank Man-
kiewicz, comedian and social critic
Dick Gregory, feminist Betty
Friedan, and FBI Director L, Pat-
rick Gray,

Monday, Virginia State Senator
Lawrence Wilder spoke in Lee
Chapel on “How Blacks Can Sur-

vive in White United States.” In
his speech, the Virginia legislator
noted that blacks “are still psycholo-
gically and economically slaves in
our own homeland,”

Wilder indicated a need in our
society for more quality black pro-
fessors and professionals to “instill
and impart the zeal and zest needed
to realize black goals,”

Wilder said that though he is
an optimist in regards to black ad-
vancement, he is aware of the
continued frustration of blacks in
the face of continued white indif-
ference,

Fewer than 50 persons attended
the Wilder speech, which was held
on the second day of Black Culture
Week.

Concerts were held Sunday and
Tuesday nights as a part of Black
Culture Week, featuring “Black

had been unable to get the Courses

of their proposals.

The Curriculum Committee had
asked for pass-fail courses to be
taken without the knowledge of the

the reduction of credits required
per term from 12 to nine. The Com-

Marsh also said the Curriculum
Committee had made the sugges-

opened to all students and not
just those committed to military
duty.

The Cold Cheek Committee re-
ported they had plenty of money
but apparently no authority among
students,

Ted Blain said the committee was
having trouble getting students to
come to their meetings and pay
their fines.

Blain also said the commitiee was

about to implement a program of
blacklisting recurrent violators by
giving merchants a list of their
names and disavowing any responsi-
bility for their checks. However, he
noted a lack of interest among
merchants and the University.

Bozell Attacks
Supreme Court

Abortion Stand

“To treat life as a
venience is rooted
American culture and
self in our

social con-
deep in the
manifests it-
nation’s laws.”

This was the observation of L.
Brent Bozell, editor of the conserva-
tive Catholic magazine Triumph, in
a speech presented at Washington
and Lee University Monday night.
He was making reference to the
recent decision of the U. S, Supreme
Court on the question of abortion.

Bozell said that many of the
organizations who are said to main-
tain the high character of the
American culture have come out
with a pro-abortion stand, He said
some of these were the American
Medical Association, the American
Bar Association and other conserva-
tive organizations. In reference to
the last group, he pointed to Senator
John Tower and Senator Barry
Goldwater as conservatives favor
ing abortion,

Bozell said the question of abor-
tion, contraceptives and sex should
be viewed in the context of the
teachings of Jesus Christ. He
cluded with the observation

con-
“God's
laws must be followed before man’s
laws.”

The speech was preceded by a

film “The Reality of Abortion”, It
supported the belief that life does
begin in the fetal stage and that

many aborted fetuses have actually
survived.

Bozell's speech and the film were
sponsored by the Washington and
Lee Chapter of Young Americans
for Freedom. That group is attempt-
ing to bring pressure on the At-

torney Generals of Texas and
Georgia to Appeal the Supreme
ruling which overturned the anti-

abortion statutes of those states,

Bozell gave the speech follow-
ing a YAF banquet held in Evan's
Dining Hall Monday. The speaker
is a former editor of National Re-
view and co-authored MeCarthy
and His Friends with his brother-
in-law, William F, Buckley, Jr. He
is a graduate of Yale and the Yale
law school,

Wanna Buy Some Used Books?

Isn't it strange how, for a few changes in the colors of

Page 2

 

the graphs, the latest edition of your economics textbook
costs two dollars more than the previous edition did last year?

And how about your American history textbook which is
three dollars higher than last year’s text, and the only change
is the addition of a chapter on “The New Frontier” (which
your professor will never get around to discussing anyway) ?

In an attempt to combat the rising costs of college texts,
student Ben Sherman has proposed a system of selling second-
hand textbooks in the University Supply Store.

Noting that a wholesaler comes to the W&L campus each
Spring and buys back used texts at standard prices, Sherman
asks: why the Supply Store couldn’t do the same, buying
the books at the same rate and then selling them on its
shelves alongside new copies of the same text, but at lower
prices?

There are certainly several valid reasons for the inaugura-
tion of such a program, including the aid this service would
be to students desiring to buy or sell used texts. Students
would no longer have to hunt down old texts (if they wish
to save a substantial amount of money) via the wind-whipped
and illegible notices posted on bulletin boards around the
university.

The buyer would be aided because he would find used
texts in all the courses in which he is enrolled all at one
convenient location. And the price of these used texts would
be lower than that of the new copies of the same text, with the
only true difference lying in the “color of the graphs,” for
instance,

The seller would have two options open to him. He could
sell his books to the Supply Store at a price matching what
the wholesaler would offer, or he can still “strike out on his
own” and sell his books via the bulletin board method, mak-
ing potentially somewhat more of a profit but encountering
the risk that a student would rather trek over to the book-
store than trek over to some location he never knew existed
before he saw the address on the bulletin board book list.
His prices though, would probably undersell those of the
University Supply Store, which would be offering the books
probably at something more than a half-price rate.

Why the large gap between what the Supply Store would
pay for a book (possibly around 20-25 percent of its list
price) and what price it woud sell a used book for (about
55-05 percent)? Contrary to popular myth, the Supply Store-
bookstore complex is currently operating at a deficit, and it
must try to prevent the growth of this deficit in the future.

Thus, as Sherman reasons, if the Supply Store were to
offer a second-hand text service, it would have to do so in
such a way that it would not lose money. Only if the Supply
Store can buy back books at prices matching what the whole-
saler asks, can it possibly avoid increasing its deficit. For
by buying used texts at these prices, any books which the
store does not sell to students can be sold back to the whole-
saler without losing money on the deal.

The prices at which the used texts would be sold would
help balance the budget of the Supply Store and the bookstore.

There are other reasons for setting up this second-hand
text service in the Supply Store. A prime consideration is that
there is actually little, if any, profit made by the store in
selling new texts, despite the high costs of the books. The
difference between what the store pays for the books and
what the books sell for is “eaten up,” to a large degree, by
freight and postage charges involved in returning unsold
new texts to the publishers, Salaries of personnel in the text
department and losses suffered when faculty members fail
to inform the store that they don’t need books which have
already been received also contribute to reducing any profits
invoved in selling new texts.

But the prime reason for establishing a second-hand text
service lies in the fundamental purpose of the Supply Store
itself. As James Toler, manager of the store points out, the
store exists to be of service to the students; by prov iding
for the sale of used texts, it would fulfill this purpose. The
present bulletin board system (if it can be called a system)
of selling used texts is at the very least inconvenient, and it
does not meet the needs of the students. Through a centralized
used text selling system, says Sherman, the University can
meet these needs,

Mr. Sherman plans to take his case to the EC and the
appropriate University officials. We wholeheartedly support
his proposals, and we wish him the best in accomplishing his
voals. In the meantime, anyone wishing to buy a used set of
History 101 books should contact the Ring-tum Phi, They're

in great shape—best offer accepted, —P.J.L.

Complaint on Procedure

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

Last week, I received in the mail
a notice from the University library
stating that they have no record
of receiving a book | borrowed dur-
ing the spring semester of last year,

The library's notice came ap-
proximately 10 months after I bor-
rowed the book. During the inter-
vening period, a summer vacation
has come and gone along with a
semester and a half of the school
year.

This lapse of time only aggra-
vates the difficulties of locating a
lost book. Also, it remains an open
question in my mind whether or
not I failed to return the book when
it was due at the end of the
spring semester, The book in ques-
tion, 823 J892t, Tindall, James
Joyce, was one of several | checked
out for a research paper. I assume—
barring whatever the postman may
bring in the next mail—that the
library has a record of my return-
ing the other books. Until last
week, Thad no reason to suspect that
this book was not back on the
proper shelf,

A Guide

By B.S. TIRFBITER

J. Jason Matthews, (not the
Ring-tum Phi), has, in the past
few weeks, offered several stigges-
tions on how to pass the cold (as
opposed to hot) winter months at
Washington and Lee. However, the
best way to pass any and every
month of the year has not been
mentioned, | refer, of course, to the
favorite pastime of so many stu-
dents-—sneezing,

A sneeze is almost always attain-
able when you need it the most,
Of course our Gallic ancestors, (and
others), used stuff, but these arti-
ficial methods have stepped aside
for the more natural and chic ways
to induce sneezing. A sneeze can
never talk back, or almost never,
provided you're not standing at a
table with a bow! of loose consis-
tency garlic dip, and can be relied
upon to do you a good turn when
ether resources, like retching and
gagging, fail. Be good to your
sneezes, coddle them, and they
will always serve you well,

For the imaginative student, the
sneeze can be a great outlet for
creativity. It has been proven that
women are attracted to men who
sneeze on their sholders at a party,
especially if they are wearing sleeve-
less dresses. The Delia Betas at
Hampden-Sydney, for example. have
innovated a unique sneeze that fills
most any occassion where it is
needed, Their secret sneeze is called
the Delta Beta Special —- the techni-
que is a closely guarded secret.
(Actually, they tried selling it but
after no one wanted to buy, they
decided it should be kept within
their fraternal order, much to the
relief of the remaining student bedy
at Hampden-Sydney).

However, through luck and cour-
ageous industrial spies, sources re-
veal that it involves pinching the
mouth tightly so that no air ean
escape, leaving the nostrils to fune
tion as exhaust vents which, due
to their natural form, will create a
two-note blast not unlike an ocean-
going tugboat, This, swears the
president of the DB house, attracts
girls as if they were ducks hearing
a mallard call,

Other interesting things can be
done with sneezes besides just get-
ting sinus relief, In medical jargon
the expulsion of sinoid tension is
called “getting faced,” which is
pretty interesting in itself, provid
ing you don't have to listen to any
metal rust for a test on Monday,

They are asking me to pay for a
book that | had no way of knowing
was lost until 10 months after the
fact.

I do not question the authority
of the library to invoke rules de-
signed to assure the return of bor-
rowed books, however, after so
long a time, | do not think it pos-
sible to determine whether I or the
library is culpable in this instance.

“The faculty card party was a fiasco. President Hunt-

Letters To The Editor...

National, state, and local gov-
erning bodies often designate a limit
of time that a party can be held
libel for an alledged infraction.
Though, these law makers are not
always models for the academic
community, I believe that there
should be limitations on how long
a student can be held responsible
for a lost book.

“University” Radio?

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

This letter is in regard to the
daily programming of WLUR-FM,
the self-proclaimed “voice of Wash-
ington and Lee University.” While
it’s cultural programs and sports
coverage (discounting of course
those phenomenal football and bas-
ketball announcers) quite possibly
reflects the interests and desires of
our university, | seriously doubt if
the daily programming does, As the
majority interest group of the uni-
versity, this programming should de-
vote a large segment of its time
to the student body’s interests, In
this respect I feel WLUR fails mis-
erably,

During the daylight hours the stu-
dent can only hear the type of
music one expects in a dentist office.
Most common seems to be either
those immortal “one thousand and
one strings play the Beatles” or
“the Herby Mann Singers sing the
hits of 1972,”

Then, all evening our ‘voice’ plays
only classical music,

I know of only one, possibly two
students who would even dream of
turning on WLUR before 11:30
p.m. when, for a whole hour and a
half, the station finally plays some
music the student body wants to
hear. While a portion of the pro-
gramming should include classical
music, it’s share of time is  in-
finitely out of proportion to the
size of its audience.

Maybe WLUR’s programmers are
in league with the bookstore’s rec-
ord department, forcing us to buy
ihe music we wish to hear, or may-
be they personally like ‘dentist
office’ and classical music. This is
no matter. The point is that WLUR
fails as a service to W&L’s interests,

If my own impressions of the
general mood of the student body
are not shared by WLUR's pro-
grammers, may I suggest a poll of
the students themselves. I think the
results would show that WLUR is
not the voice of Washington and
Lee University, Dan White ‘76

To The Art Of Sneezing

The next time you have a date
that won't “satisfy or gratify”. (a
college euphimism signifying either
dancing the Malageuenna with you
or performing unnatural acts on
your body with a Magnovix woofer),
iry a Snap Sneeze for easy consola-
tion, Hold the sneeze you feel com-
ing on as long as you can, then
at the last moment, when you are
no longer able to sustain it, leap
to your feet, draw your imaginary
six-gun which is strapped to your
hip, and let go.

Not only will your date be en-
tranced at the brilliant characteriza-
tion of a cowboy, but the explosive
force of the pent-up sneeze will
show her that you're a virile kind
of guy. If that fails, then you know
you're in trouble and that you'd
better make a Pika Beer Flip quick,
serve hot, drink fast, and forget the
bitch. Double the amount if she
doesn't buy it and still thinks
you're a gork,

If your object for Friday night
is to get “faced” quickly and easily,
then try a “Syncopated Sneeze.” Ii
will make the rank blind date an
easier burden to bear, Just put Dave
Brubeck on the record-player, wait
for his “Take Five” cut, then sneeze
three times for every downbeat in
a prolonged measure which is caco
phonous,

For a true connoissuer of fine
sneezing a few rules should be ob-
served for the maximum enjoyment
of the soul-expanding reaction. The
ideal sneeze should be between 100
and 180 miles an hour in velocity,
with a 18% humidity factor, and a
2.1 Richter Scale reading. lt is said
that the loud sneeze is distasteful
and clammy, but as the object is to
clear your nose of it's tremendous
tensions rather than measure the
scientific properties contained there-
in, this rule may be ignored, For
the rest of us a couple of simpler
rules will be sufficient: NEVER
sneeze just once as this may throw
off your delicate “sneeze control
nodule,” (ocated just behind the
eyes in the small, vaccum filled
cavily between either ear), It should
also be remembered that a sneeze
is a tremendously effective way of
chasing off a hangover or dispelling
feelings of being, “cheap and com-
mon, like all the other girls in the
place.”

As mentioned in the beginning of
this article, the more industrious
among us and these purists may
prefer to create their own sneezes,

With the guillotining of Louis XVI,
snuff has become taboo in “a la
mode” sneezing circles. Many new
techniques are possible including
funneling Campho-Phenique down
your nose, or packing Little Friskies
in your nostrils and lying amongst
a litter of hungry kittens.
However, the trusty ole standby,
looking at the sun, never seems to
fail he who is in need of a patience-
restoring sneeze, Sneezing is accept-
able almost everywhere in society
now, however, diseretion must be
used in difficult situations, like in
the room of dying person. The
cute “Jazz Age” trick of spinning

on the balls of your feet after an
especially strong sneeze, as if you
were jet-propelled, is fine for
nostalgia, but does not really lend
itself to life in these modern times,

Whatever else you plan to under-
take this term, do cultivate your
relationship with the wonderful,
organic phenanmenon of sneezing,
You will certainly find it to be one
of the most rewarding and membor-
able college experiences. So do what
you please as you freely sneeze,
and remember as the  ebscure
Absurdo Riddiculata said, “He who
daily does mightly sneeze, goes be-
fore no man on his knees.”

Spring Course Is Planned
In Library Research

In conjunction with the univer-
sity’s five-year program designed to
increase student and faculty famili-
arity with the W&L library system,
plans are now underway for a Spring
term course (Interdepartmental 190)
for students interested in biblio-
graphical resources.

According to Head Librarian and
Program Director Maurice Leach,
the course, carrying one credit. will
be conducted in accordance with a
$50,000 grant received by the uni-
versity two years ago from the Na-
tional Endowment for the Humani-
ties and the Council on Library Re-

Black Fire is an experience: people
expressing themsclves directly to an
audience,

Even with the now-familiar fact,
usually passed off in “polite” white
society like the one we have at
W&L as the same old sad story or
whatever that Black people have
been oppressed by our white-orient-
ed society for centuries, Black Fire
showed few signs of retaining any
encultured oppression manifesta-
tions, These people are not negroes:
they are Black.

And proud of it, too, Proud
enough to throw some insults at the
whites in the audience, most of
which were appropriately made, and
delivered in all manners, from the
quietest subtlety to straight “up
against the wall” type rhetoric,

The group has many facets on
stage: music, drama, and dance all
intermingled with varying amounts
of sociopolitical overtones,

The dance and music is
straightforward: — its
simplicity and directness. These
people have no sophistications or
hangups about the artistic possibili-
ties of the human body, Black Fire
is raw without being uncooked
they just have a different recipe.
And that’s very rare these days.

Most of the dance music came
from a 5-man percussion section. I
could hear some sources of Sant-
ana and the Winter Consort coming
out of those kids. Few of the per-
formers in the group are over 15;
many will probably be established
commercial artists in a few years,
if they want to be.

The movement of the rhythms,
expressed in sound, words, or move-
ment, or more often all of these
together, carry the spirit of happi-
ness. The dance is free, unfettered
movement, relating directly to the
environment where it came from.

Generals Run First
In Lynchburg Relays

By KEN RUSCIO

Washington and Lee’s indoor
track team captured its first major
title of the year last Saturday when
it travelled to Lynchburg for the
4th annual Lynchburg Relays. The
exciting six way meet was marked
by several close finishes and a tight
battle between Lynchburg, High
Point, and W&L. However, Coach
Norris Aldridge used the team’s
superior depth to the best advantage
in arranging a convincing win.

The W&L sprinters were con-
spicuous as the only contingent
which clearly dominated — their

events, With Paul Suthern anchor-
ing, the 440 and 880 yard relay
squads won with surprising ease.
Pfeifer Helms and John Neumann
doubled with Suthern in both races
while Harry Smith and Brandon
Herbert switched off for the 440
and 880. Suthern returned for his
specialty, the shuttle hurdle relay,
to bring W&L yet another first
place. This along with his contribu-
tion to the high jump relay, which
placed third, established him as the
premiere performer.
Brandon Herbert also starred
with an anchor leg in the mile
relay where coming into the final
straight he overtook his Lynchburg
opponent finishing second by inches
to Christopher-Newport. But he re-
served his real heroics for the sprint
medley relay. A last minute decision
by Coach Aldridge moved Herbert
into the event as the half-mile
anchor leg. Although unaccustomed
to the longer distance he ran one
of the fastest splits of the day in
the most exciting races of the day
giving W&L a third place and
enough points to clinch the meet
going into the final event—the four

meets

mile relay.

The four mile relay is tradition-
ally a race which after the first few
minutes lapses into a monotonous
merry-go-round about as exciting
as watching the foam rubber in the
high jump pit. The fact that this
race would consist of 48 laps and
that W&L had already won the
meet portended roughly — twenty
minutes of wasted time before the
trophy presentation. But the distance
runners were not to be denied
their moment of glory.

Bill Kalal, who earlier had run
a fast mile in the distance medley,
put the Generals in a close second
before handing off to Tom Wash-
ington. Washington threatened to
take the lead at one point but the
High Point runner held off the chal-
lenge. Jim McMenamin did take
the lead however but it was narrow
enough so that after the baton ex-
change Bob Sherwood was in third,
Sherwood quickly took the lead and
fought off several challenges. With
two laps remaining he fell to second
and appeared to be fading. On the
last lap he sprinted to the lead and
fought off his opponents to win by
a fraction.

No one dared mention “anticli-
matic.” But alas, somewhere in the
confusion Roanoke College had
mysteriously passed the pack of
runners and finished first. Offici-
ally W&L was placed second but
we all knew...

The General's depth was also
shown in third place finishes in the
shot put and two mile relays; a
second in the mile relay; a fourth
in the long-jump; and a fifth
in the distance medley. The team is
confident of success in the VCAA
and state championship meets.

Swimmers Capture Third in State;

Three Qualify for NCAA Tourney

By JIMMY BAIRD

The Virginia State Swimming and
Diving Championship were held
February 15-17 and saw highly
touted University of Virginia keep
the championship in Charlottesville
were the meet was held. The Indians
of William and Mary swam _ to
second place and the Washington
and Lee Generals finished a strong
third,

Bill Stearns, coach of the swim-
mining Generals, had high praise
for his young team. In his words,
“The team swam better than any
other team in W&L history in one
meet.” When the competition was
over with the Generals had broken
9 College Athletic Conference and
11 school records, and had a state
diving champion in the person of
Billy Cogar.

Cogar captured the tithe in the
1 meter and 3 meter competition
and qualified for nationals in both
while setting new school and con
ference records in each event. Bill
fiers, a freshman from Florida,
swam the 500 yard and the 1650
yd, freestyle, and while not winning,
did set new conference and school
records in both events. On his way
to the 1650 yd. record he also
broke the 1000 yd. record, In addi-
tion he swam in the 400 and 800
yd, freestyle relays.

Will Brotherton participated in
the two freestyle relays and the 400
yd. medley relay and helped set the
record-breaking pace in al! three.
He then qualified for nationals in
the 100° yd. though he
missed the record by .1 of a second,
He also just missed breaking the
record in the 100 yd. butterfly. Rob
Searles broke the school record in
the 400 yd. individual medley, and
Steve Erickson broke All-American
Billy Ball's conference and school
record in the 100 yd, backstroke.

Each of the relays set new rec-
ords for both school and confer-
ence. The 400 yd. medley relay,
composed of Sieve Erickson, Rich
Koch, Will Brotherton, and Jim
Howard clocked a 3:48.9, just one
second off qualifying for nationals,
The 400 yd. freestyle relay of Rob
Searles, Bill Tiers, Jim Howard, and
Will Brotherton, were timed in at
3:21.3, again an excellent race. And
finally the 800 yd. freestyle relay of

WEL Hoopers Fall To Tigers 78-68;
Take 11-11 Record Into Tournament

By JIM MOZINGO

Washington and Lee wraps up ts
basketball season this week at Se-
wanee, Tennessee, in the CAC
Championships. W&L posted an
t1l-11 record this season and faces
a tough Sewanee team in the CAC.
Despite the tournament being play-
ed in Sewanee and the Sewanee
team having some real talent, W&L
does have a couple of advantages.
One of these is the fac tthat Coach
Verne Canfield has been able to
use his bench quite effectively in the
past several weeks, and playing
Sewanee Saturday night, the third
game of the three-game round-robin
play, should give the Generals an
edge on benches. The Generals are
coming off a loss to rival Hampden-
Sydney and should be maybe a bit
eager to prove themselves,
salvaging 4 winning season, some-
thing WAL has had ever since Can-
field came here

more

That loss to Hampden-Sydney
came Saturday night at Doremus
The most impressive figure on the

court that night was Sydney's Bur-
ness. He scored 17 pts., got 19 re-
bounds, and intimidated the Gen-
erals thoroughly. The Generals again
played to a poor game. The team
has been up and down all season,
and despite Skip Lichtfuss getting
his 1,000th career point the Gen-
erals still lost 78-68.

The Generals ended the regular
season with Lichtfuss leading the
team in scoring with 19.4 ppg., and
in field goal percentage with .443.
Of the first seven players on the
team, Skip was the only one to
shoot over 40%. The team shot
374 for the season. This should be
a real trouble spot in the tourna-
ment, Paul McClure led the team
in rebounding with a 10.4 average,
followed by Lichtfuss and Guy Kerr,
This too was a problem spot for
the Generals as they were outre-
bounded 53.2 to 51.4.

In the CAC WA&L’s toughest op-
ponent, as we have already mention
ed would seem to be Sewanee, The
Sewanee team is led by 7'0” center

Lee swimming team was enhanced
this year. As coach Stearns points
out, the team which went 10-2 in
its dual meet season, ran away
with the VCAA championship, and
were third place in state, is a team
composed predominately of fresh-
men and sophomores. So there is
promise of great things to come, at
least in the next two years.

The CAC championship is the
next meet on the agenda and that
comes up this weekend at Sewanee
University in Tennessee. The swim-
ming team will join the basketball
and wrestling squads for the three
day event and they are looking for-
ward to bringing home the golden
bell. Other teams competing are
Centre of Kentucky and Sewanee

itself,

If the Generals bring home the
CAC bell, it would cap a season
that could be called exemplary.
Three of Bill Stearns’ charges, Will
Brotherton, Steve Erickson, and Bill
Cogar have qualified for the NCAA
college division nationals to be held
in Detroit on March 15-17. Stearns
has done an excellent job this sea-
son, and special notice should be
given to Noel Clinard, a W&L law
student, who has coached Bill Cogar
to such a great year.

The rest of the team will get a
rest after the CAC’s, but those

three going to nationals will still

Grapplers Up Record To 12-5;
Travel To Sewanee For CAC’s

By PAUL SIMPSON

Last Saturday afternoon, the
Washington and Lee wrestling team
upped its season record to 12-5
with two very easy wins in a tri-
angular meet, The Generals blank-
ed Washington College 39-0 and
stomped Gallaudet 48-6. The only
two W&L losses of the afternoon
came in the latter match with Dan
White and Bob Propet (wrestling
for the injured Rick Heldrich) los-
ing by decisions. Washington left
with a split defeating the sorely de-
pleted Gallaudet squad 29-18.

Doug Ford and Captain Jim Stiefl
upped their records to 12-2 and
12-2-1, respectively. They lead the
team in number of wins,

After last Wednesday's VCAA
championship, these matches were
undoubtedly a welcome relief and
allowed the team to prepare for the
CAC meet at Sewanee this weekend.
Rick Heldrich is expected to be

ready to go and the rest of the
W&L squad should be in good
shape and ready to go,

[he CAC now has only four
teams in it since Washington drop-
ped out and Coach John Piper
thinks that the only team the Gen-
erals should have trouble with
would be Sewanee. Southwestern
Piper noted, is nursing injuries and
the coach is confident that his team
is better than Centre,

Coach Piper explained that be-
cause of the way the tournament is
set up, anything can happen. The
wrestlers are seeded, giving the
returning champions an advantage,
and since Sewanee has four and
W&L has enly one (Ford), the Gen-
erals go in at a disadvantage. Piper
went on to say that he would not
be surprised to see any of the
team’s wrestlers in the finals, but
that he expected to see most of
WA&L’s finalists come from the men

with better than .500 records,

Ihe coach concluded by saying
that he didn’t think the tournament
in its present form was a good
indicator of a team’s strength be-
cause it showed favoritism to some,
giving a definite advantage.

Piper also said that depending
on the outcome of the CAC meet,
he would invite two or three mem-
bers of the team to go to the Small
College finals in South Dakota,

The Future Of ROTC At W&L

By MIKE CHRISTOVICH

Riddle No. 1: What is 154 years
old, provides ample shelter for re-
luctant draftees, and is the largest
producer of officers in the US.
Army? ;

Answer: Reserve Officer Training
Corps (ROTC).

Riddle No. 2: Now that there
is no need to be sheltered from
the Vietnam War, why should any
college student look towards ROTC
as a friendly sanctuary?

Answer: See below.

* Bg 4

ROTC. was originally devised to
develop college educated
men for positions as officers in the
Active Army and Reserves. For the
past eight years the influx
of college students towards ROTC
could) be explained by some by
the Vietnam conflict and the over-
whelming reluctance of many to be
drafted into a war few supported
or believed in, Since the height of
the Vietnam War, when the ROTC
population over 100,000, the
Corps has seen its number dwindle
to less than half that figure.

However, while the end of the
Vietnam War and the inauguration
of the volunteer army have cut
deeply into ROTC’s enlistment, it
does not necessarily spell doom fot
this elderly wing of the Army
lhere are many diverse reasons why
national ROTC will not end in the
near future, but probably the best
reason is the constant need for
trained officers, especially in reserve.

ROTC is the largest, most inex-
pensive method of obtaining and
training men to become Army
officers. These two factors become

but there is always the distinct pos-

sibility that at any time the Wash-
ington and Lee detachment could
be abolished. All of the detach-

ments of ROTC are subject to an
“annual quota” of some type and
should ROTC at W&L suddenly be-

come unpopular the detachment
would eventually fold. However,
this situation does not seem very
likely as ROTC at WAL is fluorish-
ing as of the present.

Why do students still enlist in
ROTC? Undoubtedly the answer

An announcement was made so
those interested may apply to the
EC for the position.

Larry Evans of the Recruitment
Committee reported to the EC that
March 23 and 24 would be stu-
dent Recruitment Weekend and ex-
plained the schedule to them.

Evans also reported on a recruit-
ment program which had been in
effect for the last three years as
a pilot. He said the program had
two purposes. (1) To increase the
number of applicants and (2) to
increase the number accepted,

He said the main thrust of the
program was to increase the num-
ber of applicants with a high aca-
demic status, thus increasing the
number accepted with this status;
therefore increasing the academic
status of the entire entering Fresh-
man class,

Evans noted the program was
still in the pilot stage and had not
been evaluated.
