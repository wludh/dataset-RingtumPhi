Kane, Inc., To Build Lewis Hall

Law Contract Is Awarded

By JESS REEVES

Washington and Lee's expansion
program is slowly moving along as
a general contractor has been award-
ed the $6,683,998 contract for the
new law school and cooling plant.
Plans for student housing, a new
unedrgraduate library, grounds im-
provements, and additional tennis
courts are still on the drawing board.

George W. Kane, Inc. has been
named as the general contractor for
the Lewis Hall project, being the
lowest bidder of the seven firms that
sent in bids. Kane's original bid
was approximately $6,840,000,
somewhat over the $6,400,000 pro-
jected budget for the building. Al-
lernatives were investigated to re-
duce the building costs, and the fig
ure was lowered to its present level.

After a set of plans was accepted
for Lewis Hall, the University's ar-

chitectural firm compiled a list of
thirty general contractors that would
be suitable for the job. These com-
panies were contacted and eight
eventually expressed interest in the
contract, but one of these firms
dropped out at the last minute. Two
of the bids received were less than
$7,000,000, three were in the $7,-
000,000 to $8,000,000 range, and
iwo were above $8,000,000.

The preparation of the site is
now behind schedule due to unfav-
orable weather conditions. A meet-
ing this week between the rough site
contractor and Kane's representa-
tive will determine when this month
the general contractor will take
over the site. Construction will sup-
posedly be completed by September,

The total cost of the law school
and cooling plant is expected to be
about $8,600,000. This figure in-

cludes building, architectural and
engineering fees, and the furnishing
of the new structure (which should
require approximately a million it-
elf).

Married Student Housing

HUD funding for the married
student housing has been approved
but several changes had to be made
in the plans, owing to HUD regula-
tions. By the time HUD and the
University came to an agreement
on the plans eighteen months had
elapsed and building costs were still
rising. The recent bids were 49%
higher than expected, so all advant-
ige that could have been gained by
working with HUD was lost. It was
hoped that HUD’s aid would allow
the University to offer housing at a
lower rent than would have other-
wise been possible.

At present the possibility of fi-

| Elections Are Monday
For Class & EC Offices

No fewer than 43 candidates will
be battling for 15 class and Execu-
tive Committee positions in Mon-
day’s elections.

Any runoff elections will be held
the following Tuesday. Normally
runoffs are held on Thursday follow
ing the elections but exams will be
underway on that day. Wednesday
js a reading day, and the EC doubt-
ed if any students would be on
campus that day, besides those stu-

dents living in the dorms,

In last week's runoff elections for
EC posits, second year law siudent
Doug Schwartz defeated Lewis

Powell for student body president
by just 23 votes, 660 to 627, with
77 percent of the student body vot-
ing.

nancing the project through tax ex-
empt Virginia College Building Au-
thority bonds is being investigated.
As another alternative, both mar-
and undergraduate
housing might be contracted as one
money. At any rate,
relief for married students is im sight
as either the school or private in-
vestors will provide additional hous-
ing to replace Hillside Terrace.

grounds will be rehabilitated this

spring in an extensive beautification

to check the erosion on the slopes
beside the chapel.

lOUTLOOK and REVIEW
On the Election...

Our congratulations go to Doug Schwartz for his election
victory last week; we wish him a most successful tenure as
next year’s Student Body chieftan, While we did not agree
with every point on his platform, Mr. Schwartz cannot be
faulted for the sheer drive and enthusiam of his campaign.

And remarkably enough, some of Mr. Schwartz's energy
rubbed off on the students. With 77 per cent voting in the
Thursday run-off, W&L hit a high for recent years in student
election participation. Not since the 96 plus per cent voted
in the “end classes” referendum during the Cambodia-Kent
State uproar has so much excitement been engendered by a
campus vote. But, lest we forget, that much touted student
“concern” of the spring of 1970 quickly evaporated over the
summer, and W&L drifted back into its familiar state of som-
nolence. It will be Mr. Schwartz's biggest challenge to pre-
vent that from happening now, to channel some of his elec-
tion momentum into greater post-election student involve-
iment.

Of course, such fervent campaigns have their unsavory
sides as well; for if this was one of the most exuberant races
of recent memory, it was also one of the most bitter. By
Wednesday night all sorts of ridiculous rumors, charges, and
counter-charges were flying around—about torn posters,
filched flyers, stolen ice-cream cups... you name it. It was
to the credit of both Mr. Schwartz and Mr, Powell that they
came together on election eve, shook hands, and promised to
cooperate in toning down some of the campaign excesses of
both sides.

We trust a similar maturity will characterize the whole EC
throughout the upcoming year. If so, it should be a very good

year indeed.
... and the Coed Vote

The margin of the pro-coeducation vote in last week's re-
ferendum frankly surprised even us, Though we amateur jour-
nalists make no claim to be the most astute sensors of the
campus mood, we knew the vote would be more favorable to
coeducation than last year’s. As it turned out, what we got
was almost a complete reversal.

And more than one disgruntled all-male advocate has al-
ready expained away the flip-flop; they suggest that members
of the law school couldn't vote last year, and their ballots
swayed the poll in favor of coeducation.

Well, this is simply not the case. In fact, the law school
did participate in last year’s referendum, and, anyway, there
is no evidence that they voted in a bloc on the issue.

We certainly don’t expect the Powers That Be to jump in
immediate compliance with the results. But the fact that 59
per cent of the student body disapproves of W&L’s all-male
status cannot be ignored—by students, faculty, administrators,
or trustees.

Another referendum must be taken next year; if the re-
sults are similar, then planning for a coed Washington and
Lee should shift into high gear.

A “Big Mistake”

Now that we've had a chance to catch our breath after
the three cultural programs were run off in succession earlier
this term, we offer our congratulations to those people re-
sponsible for the three programs, particularly those respon-
sible for Contact '73. All three programs were outstanding,
but the effect of each presentation was dampened by the
scheduling of the programs.

In 20 days, Black Culture Week, Contact, and the Glas-
vow Endowment Program brought no less than 15 speakers or
cultural events to the Washington and Lee campus,

Somebody made a big mistake.

The purpose of each program—to enrich the culture of this
campus community—was defeated by the scheduling. At best,
most persons only got a sampling of each program's offerings.

Instead of each program being a highlight of the academic
vear, the three bunched together, were almost a headache, with
classes, mid-terms, and papers all crushing upon us,

One program in the Fall Term, one in the Winter Term,
and one in the Suring Term would be ideal, but even two in
one term several weeks apart would be quite tolerable,

We suggest that the forces behind Black Culture Week,
Contact, and the Glasgow Program meet sometime early next
vear to work out some type of scheduling outline for their
programs. Each program could have several time slots with
which to work, and thus would not be hampered by being
limited to, say, a two-week period,

With some sort of coordinating effort, each program would
be a highlight next year, and another “big mistake” would be

Into The W&L Grading

By J. JASON MATTHEWS

I got very angry today over a
silly argument about whether teach-
ers grade the papers that fall to the
bottom of the stairs higher than the
ones that remain relatively close to
the top, near the landing. | argued
for a solid hour with my best friend
and | know that we both left in a
huff. | decided to ask a close friend
of mine who happens to be on the
faculty what exactly is the grading
system here. Ascending the stairs to
his office, I arrived at his door
which had a typewritten card in-
structing the visitor to ‘enter without
knocking”. | did so and found the
professor throwing darts at a five
foot poster of Mamie Van Doren
who was, I may add, clad insuffi-
ciently for an Arctic tour, (or any
tour save perhaps for a two-week
vacation in the rain forest of Nioar-
agua). He hadn't seen me so I
quickly ducked back and shut the
door. Knocking once, very softly, |
waited, There was a high-pitched
voice exclaiming, “One moment
please,” and a scraping of a chair,
and then, “Come in.” The office
was unchanged save for the appear-
ance of a Constable water color,
The poster had disappeared.

| explained my problem to the
professor and he smiled faintly as
he leaned back and lit a cigarette,
filter end to the match, He was
struggling not to show his discom-
fort but the slight mauve coloring
around his ears gave him away. “Let
me let you in on a secret,” he whis-
pered leaning close to me, catching
his tie in the desk drawer and pull-
ing the knot Gordian-tight, “Some
professors don't even read some
papers!" He was gasping for air
wnd had to sit back and loosen his
cravat,

“You mean... .” | stammered,

He smiled and leaned back again
catching himself just as the chair
was going to go over backwards and
fling him out the window,

| thanked him and left his office
with a new concept whirring in my
mind. Did some teachers put their
private lives before the education of
the young minds in their classrooms?
What could they have to do other
than correct papers and prepare for
class the next day? I resolved to in-
vestigate this further with my best
friend and find out the real truth.

Our next step to capture the cri-
minal professor was very ingenious
although risky, My friend and |
hog-tied some Girl Scouts, bor-
rowing their uniforms and the sev-
eral boxes of cookies they had on
them. Disguising ourselves then, as
Gitl Scouts, we would visit each

professor's house and try to see if
any stairways in their homes were
marked in any way. That is, if we
saw on entering, the top three stairs
marked “D” with paint or tape, and
the rest “C” “B” and “A” in des-
cending order we would know for
sure. Besides being very embarrass-
ed when the pick-up filled with tow-
nies stopped us on the road be-
ween houses the whole plan failed
miserably. We were stymied.

There was nothing to be done,
The impressive wall was too great
for us to seale. In search of some
sort of advice | visited my faculty
friend again.

| entered his office and he looked
up from the desk, quickly crumpling
the paper he had been doodling on.
As he flipped it into the wastebas-
ket, he motioned me to a chair by
his desk. I dejectedly told him my
story.

On Campaign Tactics

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

The recent student body elec-
tions and the coeducation referen-
dum have brought to light some-
thing that does not augur well for
this university. | am referring to the
actions of certain individuals and
groups of individuals who apparent-
ly felt that freedom of speech was
intended only for those who agree
with them. The destruction of pos-
ters is not new here, but never be-
fore has it been so widespread, and
never before have the victims of this
tactic been so specific.

Those of us who opposed coedu-
cation and supported Lewis Powell
were forced to accept the fact that
most of the posters we put up would
“disappear” overnight, some within
a few minutes, I personally observ-
ed three students, all undoubtedly in
favor of free speech, methodically
strip the campus of every anti-coedu-
cation poster they could find. | also
helped make posters for Lewis
Powell's runoff bid, and saw only a
handful of them up 12 hours later,
on the election day,

| recall being told that a univer-
sity is a marketplace for ideas, a
place where anyone could say any-
thing he liked, without fear of be-
ing prevented from saying it again
Apparently this is no longer the
case at WAL. The fascist pigs are
here in force, and their brown-shirt
tactics have probably helped them
to) Velory,

“Don't worry my boy, it’s not
that important. Believe me.” He
shook his pen for added emphasis
and flicked some ink on his cheek.
He continued talking to me, not
realizing what he had done. After
a few more minutes I rose to leave.
He got up to shake my hand but
but banged his shin against the chair
and had to sit down again real fast.
| said goodbye and walked out, As
| was going down the stairs, deep
in thought, | noticed something.
The paint on the side of the stair-
way was wet, it glistened in the
light. | took out my handkerchief
and wiped away the excess, The let-
ter “C” stood out plain as day. My
mind wheeled, You mean, a whole
department!?

“Yes, a whole department,” a
voice sneered, “Now come this way.”
My friend the teacher was standing
above me on the landing with a

Now, | don't claim that there was
au “conspiracy” or that these tot-
alitarian actions were an accessory
to the game plans of those who ul-
timately derived benefit from them.
| am sure Doug Schwartz had the
good sense not to know that his op-
ponent's posters were being destroy-
ed. But if there was no planning in-
volved, there was still a good deal
more to this than haphazardness,
and Mr. Schwartz's narrow victory
is immeasurably cheapened by it.

| must also question the validity
of the margin of victory for coedu-
cation. | think the results might
have been different, at least given
an equal opportunity to express their
viewpomis,

This brings me to the question I
must now pose: Do we, as mem-
bers of a free society and partici-
pants in the exchange of ideas, tol-
erate this assault on our rights, or
do we repudiate these tactics and
the individuals using them? If we
do not, |, for one, would be asham-
ed to be a member of this com-
munity any longer,

important dual meets including
Hampden-Sydney and Bridgewater.

Brandon Herbert, co-captain, will
lead the 440 men. In excellent con-
dition following a successful indoor
season he will be backed up by
Dave Lawson, Harry Smith, and
Willic-Bob Wingfield. Dave Estes al-
though moved to the 880 will also
probably run an occasional one-
lapper, Estes is now training for the
880 in an effort to boost an injury-
riddled distance squad. Tom Bau-
mann, freshman 880 runner, and 3-
miler Mike Burns have been treat-
ing injuries for several weeks with
little result. Bob Sherwood, miler
and co-captain, has recently been
added to the list. Stu Nibley injur-
ed since cross-country appears out
for the season. The weight will
therefore fall on Bill Kalal, Jim
McMenemin, Tem Washington, and
Rich Vieser.

Paul Suthern, hurdler, is looking
forward to still more honors to add
to his indoor collection, One of the
tops in the state, he is also a VCAA
and CAC contender. Phifer Helm;
and John Newmann should also
contend for the conference honors,

In the field events Barclay Arm-
strong (long jump and triple jump)
and Paul Hartmann (pole vault) will
be called on for valuable points as
will Mark George and Frank Por-
ter in the high jump. Shotputters
Phil Jones and Bob Fallis will also
contribute to the team effort.

The Generals open their season
against Shepherd on Tuesday and
Madison on Thursday, These early
meets should unite the team for the
spring campaign which includes the
VCAA championship on April 21
and the CAC championship on May
11 and 12.

THE

House Di
To Soviets, 146-141

By KEN RUSCIO

“It's not who wins and loses.
Competition is the thing,” dechared
ler-Ovanesyan, coach of the USSR
track them as he calmly plotted the
defeat of the Americans. He con-
tinued seriously, “We—my country,
your country—should put out our
best athletes. That is the best thing.”
He then sat back and stifled a yawn
which was really a clever facade
disguising his laughter at those silly
Americans, One can imagine what
was on his mind as well as cvery
other member of the Russian team
as they witnessed yet another chap-
ter of the NCAA-AAU squabble.
They were undoubtably overjoyed as
the NCAA threat of suspension fore-
ed several athletes out of the com-
petition allowing the Russians a
narrow 146-141 win,

In a week during which the NCAA
should have been worrying more
about their basketball tournament
they turned instead to track. The
USSR-USA track meet, held in
Richmond last Friday and Satur-
day is controlled by the AAU, the
governing body for amateur athletes
in the United States. To qualify for
the meet the runners and field event
men had to have excelled at the na-
tional AAU championships held in
New York two weeks prior to the
international meet. In the national
championships several top cvilege
performers qualified to compete
against Russia and no doubt eagerly
awaited the chance. At this point
the NCAA officials cleared their
throats, unrolled their scroll, shook
their heads, and decreed flatly,
“No.” The AAU had refused to beg
for NCAA sanction and therefore
any college athletes who participat-
ed in the meet would be subject to
severe penalities along with their
school. Well anyone with common
sense would expect the AAU to say
hell yeah, and go right ahead and
request certification, a simple, inane
procedure. But anyone acquainied
with the past history of the feud
knows that common sense has noth-
ing whatsoever to do with amateur
athletics in the United States. So the
AAU official ascended his podium,
declared that since this meet was in-
ternational it required no certifica-
tion and besides, after all, it was a
“matter of principle.” With that he
put his thumb to his nose, flicked
his tongue out, turned around, and
stomped away.

The college athletes found them-
selves in a predicament. It was not
so much prohibitions against them-
selves that presented the problem
but it was difficult for them to com-
pete when the entire institution they
belonged to could be inflicted with
penalties, Fred Samara of the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania and Dennis

Walker of Adelphi along with their
athletic departments chose to defy
the NCAA. The outcome of their re-
bellion won't be known until a final
court hearing is held Tuesday, For
his pains, Samara was the only last
place finisher to receive a standing
ovation. Dennis Walker, competing
in the men’s medley relay which
beat the Russians when Valeri Bor-
zov pulled up lame, likewise receiv-
ed one. But Rod Milburn, the great-
est hurdler in the world as well as
five other world class athletes and
the US coach acquiesced and with-
drew from the meet, Their presence
would assuredly have reversed the
5 point margin of defeat for the
men’s team.

Appropriately enough, the star at
Richmond was a child, a 14 year
old, eighth grader from Washing-
ton, D.C. who won the women’s
880 and anchored the medley relay
which insured a victory for the U.S.
women's team. Robin Campbell's
youthful innocence became an ironic
symbol of purity in an affair mark-
ed by over-bureaucratization and
disregard of the values of amateur
athletics. She too received a stand-
ing ovation.

Otherwise the meet, compared to
some of the New York and Los
Angeles spectacles, was not notable.
In some areas the Americans lost
where they should have won (the
hurdles and three mile, with Tracy
Smith recovering from the flu) and
won where they should have lost
(George Grenn's defeat of Olympic
gold medalist Bonarchuk in the
hammer). Other events went as ex-
pected with the Americans captur-
ing the 600 yard run and the 60
yard dash and the Russians winning
the 1000 yard run, the mile, and
the pentathlon.

Nevertheless the meet has enorm-
ous potential. Freed from the grips
of bureaucratic monstrosities which
still have rules requiring shorts to
no more than two inches above the
knee and restricting the value of
awards to less than the price of a
cheap trophy, the affair may realize
the vision imitially hoped for.
Amateur athletics is at the cross-
roads, With the tragedy of the
Olympics still arousing debate and
the NCAA-AAU war reaching a
boiling point something must be
done in the near future. Common
sense, that elusive quality which
somehow manages to eternally by-
pass the two organizations, would
dictate the turning over of the whole
mess to the athletes themselves, Two
outmoded organizations clinging to
archaic notions of amateurism is, at
best, an anachronism, Perhaps with
this most recent fiasco a freason-
able alternative can be constructed,

W&L Stickmen Split Two;
Battle Cornell On Friday

WAL’s lacrosse team split a pair
of scrimmages this week, losing to
Mt. Washington 11-7 and crushing
Yale 16-5.

Against Mt. Washington last Sat-
urday, the Generals got in a hole
early after two quick goals in the
first period. But they battled back to
within one, 4-3, The Wolfpack turn-
ed it on late in the first half and
took a 6-3 lead into the locker room.

The Generals scored twice in the
second half to close within one
again, 6-5. But the Wolfpack kept its
cool and went on to win 11-7,

Sam Englehart and Skip Licht-
fuss were the big guns against the
Wolfpack, each scoring two goals.
Don Carroll chipped in another
goal and contributed two assists. Ed
Tognetti scored a goal and won
several face-offs, Bryan Chasney
helped the cause with two assist,
and John Lalley added one assist.

Two different teams played Yale
last Monday. The team that showed
up in the first half was lethargic and
Yale took advantage of it to ser-
ounge a 4-3 halftime lead. The team
that came out in the second half was
totally different, scoring 13 straight
goals enroute to a 16-5 win, Coach
Jack Emmer said he had “a heart
to heart talk” with the team at half-
time. Whatever he did, it worked,
“That's the first time I've seen them
play with that kind of tenacity, said
Emmer. They didn't concede any-
thing. When they get motivated,
they can be giant-killers.”

Speaking of giants, there will be
plenty of them around at the Hero's
Tournament this weekend, On Fri-
day, the Generals take on Cornell
at 3:00. The winner of the W&L-
Cornell game will take on the win-
ner of the Hobart-Maryland con-
test on Saturday, with the two losers
also playing each other,

Cornell, national champion
years ago and Ivy League champ
last year, is not as strong this year
but should be plenty tough, “Cornell
has so many good young people that
it'll be a good game, said Emmer.
He feels that WAL's experience in
tough games should provide the
edge. Hobart, another possible op-

two

ponent, was 17-1 last year, losing to

Budget Restricts Dance Board,
Refunds Promised To Students

We wish to address ourselves to
the two most outstanding issues
which ‘have confronted the Dance
Board during the year: (1) the “qual-
ity” of the entertainment provided
and (2) the number of concerts and
the (legal) nature of the dance plan
contract, Antagonists we surely are
not—to accept the responsibility
and the work necessary to the pre-
paration of a program is a chal-
lenge we are glad to accept. It is
one thing to work constructively to
better the institution; still another
to criticize an accurate understand-
ing of the situation.

Concerning the “quality” of the
groups presented, they have repre-
sented our honest attempts to pro-
vide, quality entertainment. The acts
of “unquestionable” quality: ‘Tull,
Neil Young, Yes, and Chicago, to
name a few, have long been de-
manding prices which remove them
from the scope which a Doremus
concert may project. This is exactly
our dilemma, and the finances have
long been the crux of the problem.
The 1971-1972 Dance Board receiv-
ed $19,000 from the sale of dance
plans in advance of any pre-season
bookings. Adding a six thousand
dollar surplus amassed the previous
year, the Dance Board was able to
amass $25,000 and to put on four
shows. The year was not a success-
ful one in terms of student response.
Consequently, this year’s program,
with Richard Middleton as president
received only $9,000 in advance
sales and the three concerts this year
have been presented within a budget
of only $12,000, Obviously, had this
year’s board been blessed with the
$25,000 budget of its predecessor,
six concerts would have been a real-
ity. As is now the case, with half
the funds we have presented three-
fourths the number of shows. Ac-
knowledging our severely limited
pre-season funds (which are a neces-

sity when entering into the booking
procedure), we sincerely feel that
our program has represented the
best of both worlds of entertainment
to the best of our financial abilities.

It is with ‘the second problem that
we feel that the true nature of the
discontention has sprung, involving
the number of concerts and the na-
ture of the dance plan contnact.
There will not be another concert
this year. Simply, we are unable to
finance another show, As to the na-
ture of the contract, its stipulations
involve, as many of you have
brought to our attention, a “pro-
mise” of a service to be performed,
in this case the projection of 6 con-
certs during the course of the year.
A promise iis a two-way proposition.
We never “promised” to present six
concerts if we were unable to pro-
cure the student funds necessary for
their projection. Perhaps the key to
the successful operation of the
Dance Board has always been that
essential element of faith. Without
jit we can never hope to be in pos-
session of the necessary bucks.

In short, with the money we re-
ceived we feel that the three con-
certs presented thus far were the
best we could sponsor with our re-
stricted budget and that we have
acted in your best interest. We have
now been forced to conclude that
the dance plan is an obsolete method
of procuring funds, and new pro-
posals will be announced early in
the spring term.

In thte meantime, we wish to re-
pay those faithful few who were
largely responsible for the program
this year. Preliminary reimburse-
ment procedures will begin on
Thursday and Friday March 22 and
23 between the hours of 9 to 4 in
the Co-op. Those who wish to re-
ceive some repayment will leave
their names at the tables and the ac-
tual reimbursement will occur in the
spring term as we currently have
several minor accounts outstanding.
The money you will receive will not
be a large sum, but we believe this

We apologize for the obvious lack

years past. As we enter a new phase
in concert-type presentations, our
efforts can only be strengthened by
your cooperation and understand-

of Law Lewis Larue said withhold-
ing ithe degree may be a breach
of the University’s contract with
the students, “It is reasonably under-
stood that the catalogue is one of
the sources of the University’s con-
tract. | don’t see anything in the
catalogue that authorizes the action
that’s proposed. It has dubious legal
merit.”

The issue very nearly came to a
head last year when senior Tom
Mitchell was indicted in the Fall
for holding up a gas station. Then
as now most of the pertinent evi-
dence was locked up in impending
criminal proceedings. The Univer-
sity was saved from having to make
a decision about Mitchell’s case
when the student voluntarily with-
drew from the University.

Grading Habits Of W&L Faculty
Revealed By Student Investigation

(Continued from Page 2)
off of which teachers were throw-
ing papers. Others were coaching
them and I caught fragments of
sentences like, “turn the wrist more”
and “extend for better elevation
and distribution,”

In another corner of the room
were several desks, and professors
were slashing papers with red ink
pens over and over again, Here too,
the “coaches” would be advising.

I turned in disbelief and stammer-
ed, “You mean?”

The heartless laughter sent chills
up my back. “Yes that’s right, a
p-ofessor training ground! Here -
where we learn to grade and evelu-
ate papers with the greatest dispatch.
The only problem is what we're go-
ing to do with you, Gentlemen, quiet
please. Let's take a vote.”

The solemn congregation all rais-
ed their hands and pointed a massive
cauldron which bubbled and hissed
evily. My captor smiled and pushed
me toward it.

“What is it? What are you going
to do with me?” I asked, now fran-
tic.

“This is boiling red ink,” laugh-
ed the professor, “and that’s where
you're going my friend.” He made
a move to push me in,

1 dodged sideways and jumped
off the platform that hovered above
the cauldron, As I dashed toward
the door, the other professors all
began yelling and to delay them, |
pulled a switch labeled “Danger”
and bolted up the secret stairway.
As | ran up the stairs three at a
time, | heard confused screams and
then a muffled roar. Whatever I
pulled must have been connected to

something pretty powerful. I reach-
ed the door and dove into the office,
breathing deeply and thanking my
lucky stars that I would be seeing
sunlight once again. I bolted the
sliding panel shut and quickly left,
locking the outer door as well.

Back in my apartment, I relayed
the amazing story to my best friend
who wagged his head in disbelief
and offered to share the Roma cook-
ing Rose he was enjoying. It was un-
believable, he said, no one would
ever buy that story,

I don't know, maybe it was a
dream, | had been pretty tense about
things this week, maybe it was just
a hallucination, It does seem pretty
wild, doesn't it? I'd go back there
but things have been piling up and
you know, like the professor said,

it’s really not that important, I've -

got to go now, the library closes in
an hour and I still need some titles
for the bibliography, I hope the pro-
fessor swallows it because I just
don't have time to read all the books
I should.
