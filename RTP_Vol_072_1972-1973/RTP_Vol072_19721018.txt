 

In the run-off for Freshman EC representatives are: (seated) Mike Luttig
and Rob Lindsey. In the University Council race are: (standing) Bob

Kelly and Malcolm Hastings.

By PAUL SIMPSON

Iwo candidates for each of the
four freshman class offices will face
each other Thursday in run-off con-
tests,

The failure of any candidate to
obtain a majority of the vote in
Monday’s elections prompted the
run-offs, in which the top vote-
getters in Monday’s elections will
square off for each post.

Out of the original field of six
candidates for president, Ben Barton
and Jay DuRivage will compete in
the primaries, In the other three

posts, where originally four con-
tenders ran for each office, Ron
Harr will oppose Bob Orkin for

vice-president, Mike Luttig and Rob
Lindsey will face off in the Execu-
tive Committee representative run-
off, and Malcolm Hastings will
battle Bob Kelly to represent the
Freshmen in the University Council,

Voting is set for tomorrow and
will be held in the quad from 8:30
a.m.-12:15 p.m, and 1-4 p.m. Special
provision has been made to set up
a voting table in Evans Dining Hall
from 12:15-1 p.m.

Candidates are limited to $2.50 in
expenditures for the run-off cam-
paign in addition to money they
have left over from the allotted
$7.50 for the initial campaign.

In other EC business, it was an-
nounced that the W&L Board of

Trustees unanimously approved the
motion that the President of the
student body shall be invited to at-
tend all three regularly scheduled
meetings of the Board,

Other items discussed were fresh-
man Mike Okin’s proposal for the
buying and selling of new and used
books. He suggested an index filing
system of books for sale. To quote
from Nis letter to the EC”... |
find it increasingly apparent that
this school needs some sort of center
to facilitate the circulation of used
text books,”

Also, the way in which upper-
classmen are to be oriented to the
new public honor trial system was
discussed. After an initial doubt was
expressed by many of the EC mem-
bers concerning the effectiveness of
this measure, it was agreed that
the president, vice president and
secretary would spend a few minutes
in each fraternity house sometime
within the next three weeks to ex-
plain the new procedure and answer
any questions,

In a report given by Bill Merrill
concerning the Publications Board,
it was discovered that both the Ariel
and the Calyx will face financial
difficulties if they expect to carry
out their planned projects. In the
case of the latter, this comes from
the fact that the Calyx came up
several hundred dollars short in their
projected estimate for sitting fees.

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, OCTOBER 18,

W&L Student To Join Trustees

In their meeting on campus this
past weekend the Board of Trustees
voted to invite the student body
president to all future regularly
scheduled meetings, The decision to
include a student in Board pro-
ceedings was unanimous,

According to a statement released
by the Executive Committee, the
president will be permitted to “par-
ticipate in all deliberations and dis-
cussions of the Board, except on
agenda items to be specified by the
Board for each meeting.”

This restriction will effectively
translate into having the student
body representative present for the

vast majority of discussions by the
Board; the Board however reserves
the right to exclude him from some
portion of a meeting in extraordi-
nary circumstances,

hough this safety clause remains,

the current student body president,

Bob Brennan, stated that none of
the Board members this weekend
could conceive of an instance in
which he might be asked to leave.
If such a question arises, the student
president himself would be advised
fully on the nature of the circum-
stance and would also be allowed to
state his objections to President
Huntley and the Rector of the
Board.

Ihe original proposal set before
the Board by the EC was to place a
student as a voting member on the
Board. “We came to understand the

difficulties that would arise from
such an arrangement,” Brennan
said,

Brennan went on to emphasize
that he and future EC presidents

will have “full floor privileges” with
no restraints on vocalizing student
sentiments, even if he has no actual
vole,

The proposal for a student Trus-

by EC Vice President Bill Merrill
last year. It was then taken before
the board at their spring meeting
by Brennan and former President
Steve Robinson; then it went to a

subcommittee for study,

The Board holds three regular
meetings annually, usually two on
campus and one in a city elsewhere.

Brennan applauded the fact that
this action now “gives the Board a
direct source to the student body.”

Exactly What Are They Hiding
Down In The Saunas, Anyway

Who knows what evil lurks in the
heart of W&L’s saunas? Athletic
department officials do, or so they
say.

According to these officials, the
opening of the saunas has been de-
layed, since September, by a faulty
mechanism in the sauna electrical

system,
A WAL electrician apparently
was unable to repair the mech-

anism, so the university had to send

away to the company which built
the saunas for a new part,

Wherever that company is locat-
ed, it must be well off the beaten
paths of the post office. For well
over a month has elapsed since the
opening of school, and since the
discovery of the faulty mechanism.
And still the part has not arrived.

But the continued inoperative
state of the saunas has prompted

| Walk For Hunger Nets
| $2,700 For Proverty Aid |

“Walk for Hunger and keep on
Trucking.” And 38 W&L students,
30 VMI cadets and over 300 towns-
people did just that Saturday to
raise money for CROP, a hunger
program of the Church World Ser-
vice. The Reverend Renwick Ken-
nedy of the Ministeral Association
of Buena Vista was the ostensible
organizer of the march.

The idea was that the walkers
would be paid a certain amount for
each mile by a sponsor, For those
walking for a nickel a mile, it was
a true labor of love.

Frank Porter, the leader of the
student march Saturday, which pre-
ceded the march of the townspeople,
said that combined efforts yielded
over $2,700. Twenty-five per cent of
the money will stay in Rockbridge
County; the rest will go to hunger
programs all over the world.

“it's really the best way to raise
money because it’s so obvious to
people what you are doing,” Porter

Number 5

  
  
 

said, “At the same time you are
letting people know you're concern-
ed.” Although there were no real
spectators, many students were more
than willing to pay to see their
fellow students harrangued into
walking ten miles

CROP is only one of many func-
tions of The Church World Service,
which acts as a clearing house for
anti-poverty programs, It primarily
collects clothing and distributes it
in needy areas whether they are
“poverty” areas or disaster areas like
Biafra or Bangladesh where CWS
has been quite active, in recent
months,

With the exception of Sigma Chi,
which contributed $20 and partici-
pants, fraternity houses did not turn
out in force. Pi Kappa Phi contri-
buted $20 to the cause of the hikers,
most of whom were freshmen.

A similar Hike for Hunger is
planned in Lynchburg this coming
Saturday.

OUTLOOK and REVIEW!

1972

New Student Influence

We rejoice at the announcement of an action taken by the
Board of Trustees last weekend to allow a student to sit on
the Board as a non-voting participant. This comes as the

October 18,

result of a long-standing effort headed by last year’s student
body president, Steve Robinson, and the current one, Bob
Brennan. Henceforth, the student president will be allowed
to attend board meetings and to exercise full floor rights.

What this means is that a student voice will be heard on
crucial issues which has never been heard before. Although
the request originally suggested the student be a voting mem-
ber, we acknowledge the complications that could arise in
such a case and we support the current arrangement.

Previously, the student body president has been merely
permitted to give a brief report to the Trustees on student
affairs; the importance of this change, therefore, should be
obvious. While it may not translate into real student power
in determining university policy, it does go a long way in
providing considerable student influence.

Registering To Vote (Cont.)

One day last week, a third-year W&L law student was
humming down the road on his way into campus from his
country apartment. Suddenly, a roadblock loomed ahead. He
pulled over, and a policeman sauntered over to his window.

“We're checking for county tags,” the cop said; he then
proceeded to write out a ticket for the deinquent student,

“But look,” said the student. “I've just been down to the
voting registrar. They say I’m not eligible to vote because
I'm not a resident. But then they turn around and say, since
I'm a resident nine months out of the year, I have to pay a
tax for use of the roads. Is that fair?”

The policeman thought a moment, “You've got a point,”
he said, “Why don’t you take it to court?” And that’s pre-
cisely what the student intends to do.

Now, this local double standard may, in fact, be technically
legal. But still, the big question remains as to whether or not
this is fair.

On the final day for registration of new voters in Lexing-
ton, between 50 and 100 students were turned away by the
city registrar. Meanwhile, the county registrar was granting
students a temporary registration, which allows them to vote
in the Presidential contest only.

But the very fact that the city and county registrars were
acting in an entirely different manner toward student appli-
cants points to the acute problem students in Virginia are
faced with. That is: the ruling of State Attorney-General
Miller perverts the intentions of the extended franchise by
placing too much control in the hands of individual local
registrars. They may, in essense, set their own criteria for
determining what constitutes “residency.”

Two Washington and Lee law students, Doug Schwartz
and Dave Shapiro, are attempting to file a suit with the fed-
eral courts which would force the local registrar to open up
for another week before the election to allow for the issuance
of temporary registrations. If they succeed. W&L and VMI
students who have not already registered would have the
chance to vote, even if only for the presidential ticket.

Schwartz and Shapiro claim that the city registrar has
acted in violation of the 1965 Voter Rights Act by delivering
a “special line of inquiry” to students here. But to file a group
action, they need fifty students to identify themselves as hav-
ing been refused by the registrar; at last count, they were con-
siderably short of that number.

What we don't understand is what Lexington is afraid
of. Certainly in some university communities, like Berkeley,
Cambridge, or Chapel Hill, massive student enfranchisement
could have considerable effect on local politics, But can you
imagine students taking over in Lexington?

As we stated in these columns last week, absentee voting
by mail is a difficult and bureaucratized process. While there
still may be time for students to apply for absentee ballots in
most states (and we urge them to do so), we think it is sad
that Lexington has chosen effectively to keep the vote from
student hands.

Joe Character was what many
would call a typical W&L student.
He had graduated from high school
blending a high level of academics
with a fair amount of athletic
prowess. Although Joe was mod-
estly quiet and from a small north-
ern town which did not focus on a
big social life, he still was an ami-
able fellow, with a good personality
once you got to know him.

Joe followed the majority of his
freshmen counterparts in signing up
for Rush and appeared enthusiastic
at the chance of meeting upperclass-
men, who were involved in the fra-
ternity circle.

After receiving some sound advice
from a friendly upperclassmen, Joe
was able to ease through the open
house registration by eliminating
three fraternities that were avidly
called “aquariums” by many upper-
classmen on campus, When starting
day had arrived Joe followed the
parade of fraternity prospectives
into the quad and waited unassur-
edly for his name to be called for
the first open house date.

Finally the whistle blew and
people began scurrying toward their
particular open house choice, fore-
ing Joe to note the likeness of
Kansas City cattleyards to the mass
herdes wandering in the quad
searching for their fraternity guide.

Upon arrival at his first open
house Joe was greeted by a wel-
coming committee consisting of the
President, Rush-Chairman, an d
housemother of the fraternity. Joe
noted immediately that their were
many smiling girls wandering around
the house with no particular pur-
pose.

At this point Joe received a name
card with his name and his home-
town on it, but felt a twinge of
insecurity as almost nobody had

Letters

Matthews Blasts Malo

My Most Esteemed Sir:

With regards to Mr. Hinely’s
glowing recommendation of the con-
cert last Saturday which featured
Malo [| say Poppycock! Despite
Malo’s obviously apparent advant-
age of being “real live chicanos
from the ‘burrio’” (which means
donkey—barrio means neighbor-
hood), I felt that the concert was
at best tolerable—the wait at best,
annoying—and the music at the very
best, dated,

The concert, slaied to begin at
eight, was grotesquely marred by
the group called Eggs Over Easy
who did, indeed, (as Mr, Hinley
suggests) have sound system difficul-
ties. | take singular pride in being
one of the “obnoxious loundmouths”
who demanded their exit and the
appearance of Malo,

However, had | known exactly
what | was clamoring for, I would
have kept my mouth shut, In any
case, a “good combination of funk,
grease, and a little of that old time
jukin’” is, to my mind, exactly
what their problem was; and that is
exactly why Eggs Over Easy is
comprised of members of defunct
groups.

But on to Malo! Hinley's refer-
ence to the “energy that flows from
Bill Rosales’ head into the audi-
ence by way of his drums” must be
a fancy way of saying headache. |
don't know where Hinely was sil-
ting, but on my side of the whole
bleacher was not really getting into

 

the “contact high” pouring from
those drums,
| do know that when they cut

their “Pana” number short, | heard
a sigh of relief from about thirty
people which sounded like a late
October nor'easter off Cape Cod

If Malo did in any way “chaos”
people, ‘chaos I presume to be a
state of mind), it was tantamount
to sending them on the blackest
bummer that ever stomped into
their heads, man.

Finally. Mr. Hinely refers the
curious to those that did attend for
picture of the show last
and how great it really

Joe wondered if this “pick by first
appearance” was actually prejudice
to the section of the country he
came from. Unfortunately in many
cases the answer was yes, After two
weeks of no bids, Joe surmised that
either his inability to answer such
philosophical qustions as: What do
you think of Rush?, How was Na-
tural Bridge?, and Where are you
from again? or his insufficient

Unenlightened, lend me your ears;
it now becomes perfectly clear how
and why this group got their name
before being ridden out of the
“barrio” on a rail! Santana's boys
are spinning like gyroscopes in their
graves as the “popularity polls” for
the Dance Board go, yes Mr. Hinely,
even lower!

was vociferously challenged by an
official of the School. So we did
a statistical study of the charge ac-
counts in the Bookstore for the pres-
ent year. The results: 25.6 per cent
of our accounts were used by Com-
merce students excluding freshmen.
The Commerce majors compose
25.05 percent of the student body,
again excluding freshmen.

Can one draw the conclusion from
these figures that the Commerce ma-
jors are more literate (by 5.5 tenths
of one per cent) than the liberal arts
majors?

One thing is very sure: I cannot
tell Commerce majors from anybody

Madison College reports that the
production last Saturday was an
unqualified success, “Ed Trostle is
excellent,” reported Tim McFeley
with the Madison student center staff
which sponsored the show. “He is
artistically perfect and every bit as
good as Hal Holbrook,” added Mc-
Feley, who saw the Holbrook pro-
duction also,

The packed Madison audience
gave Trostle a resounding ovation
which resulted in an encore.

A representative of Hollins ad-
ministration also gave similar com-
ments regarding Monday's night’s
show at Hollins. “The audience re-
sponse was most enthusiastic,” she
remarked,

In an article this week by colum-

Roanoke World News reported this
about the actor:

THE RING-TUM PHI

RN i BOR

  

By DARRYL C, CARLTON

Many sophomores, juniors and
seniors are no doubt wondering
what particular thing freshmen are
most scared of this year, what they
detest most about school life; in
short, what they are fed up with.
It is sarcastic P.E. instructors?
Sadistic calculus teachers? Or is it
something deeper, such as the time
they have to get up in the morning,
or the food in the cafeteria?

Gym coaches, calculus teachers,
and cooks may set their minds at

the most feared experi-
ence is none of these things, In-
stead, it is the dreaded (ta-ta!)
laundramat! Yes friends. the fresh-
man landramat, located in the base-
ment of Freshman Dorm I. If you
have never been down there, it may
be difficult for you to comprehend
the dread and disgust by its in-
fernal presence.

The laundramat looks, at first
glance, like any other laundramat,
except that it is dingier than most
and usually has water running over
the floor. But there are the same
washers, and the same dryers. There
is a machine for detergent, and there
is even a drink machine.

1 remember my first visit. Two
friends and | innocently descended
into the bowels of the so-called
“Jaudramat.” Obviously, the _ first
thing to do was buy the detergent,
Fortunately (we thought) a machine
that screamed “All Your Favorite
Detergents!” drew our attention.
Finding out that “All Your Favorite
Detergents!” meant three different
levers to choose from to get a box
of “Tide” did not phase us in the
least.

ease. For

So one of my friends put a dime
into the machine and pulled a lever.
Nothing happened. One dime had
been sacrificed to the laundramat.
Would he dare chance the sacrifice
of another? He would.

rhis time, he pulled a different
lever. He got the same result.
Twenty cents were gone, never to
return, One of us went out to the
grocery store on his bike to buy
some detergent. While he was gone,
my other friend began to get thirsty.

His eyes lit on the drink machine.
Ah! Respite for the weary student!
He put 20 cents into the machine.
He pressed a button, As you have
already guessesd, again nothing hap-
pened. He kicked the machine. That
didn’t help. By now he had sacri-
ficed 40 cents to the infernal ma-
chines of the laundramat with no
results. He hadn't even had a chance
to wash his clothes yet.

Finally, our mutual friend return-
ed with the detergent. Dare we risk
more money on the diabolical ma-

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

  

By TOM RADIGAN

Phe goals of an educational com-
munity should not be formed with
ideas of compulsion and _ pressure,
The knowledge that one is hoped
to attain at the university can only
be obtained, finally, through a
dedication to learning and personal
growth.

I have been asked to write con-
cerning the elimination of compuls-
ory physical education within the
context of a school maintaining high
grading pressures, unquestioned pri-
orities, administrative bureaucracy,
and the like. I will try; but what
1 am to say cannot be effectively
isolated from all the events going
on in our university.

We have come to Washington and
Lee adults, in the eyes of our parents
sending us here, in the eyes of our
legal relationship with the nation.
We come here to seek truth, with
a responsibility of conduct to our
fellows. Yet, it would seem in the
eyes of the administrators (specifi-
cally in this case-concerning P.E.)
we are still children, to be guided
and prodded along in an educa-
tonal endeavor.

1 believe that the maintaining of
a healthy physical condition is the
responsibility of every student at
Washington and Lee, as it is for
every teacher and administrator—
every person in all sectors of so-
ciety. The point is, however, that
it is one’s personal responsibility,
in the same way that it is one’s
personal responsibility to pursue a
course of study and obtain a suf-
ficient knowledge of that subject
during his stay at the university.

Certainly one cannot justify the

gages

Sabineen wis Fa
Should It Be Required?

and the tremendous assortment of
faculty from the point of view of
mandatory P.E, courses; one should
not even try. The coaches are there
for the various teams fielded by
W&L; the complex primarily exists
for these same atheletes. Making
P.E. courses optional should not
make the courses more lifeless than
they are now. What it would seem
to me to do would be to open up
the resources of the P.E. department
to groups of students interested in
specific areas of physical education.
It would force the department to
offer courses of interest to the stu-
dents, so that students would sign
up, and so the numbers of gym
instructors would be justified. It
would insure that the students tak-
ing the courses were really interest-
ed in them and not just in class to
fulfill requirements. And it would
give students freedom to make their
own decisions as to whether or
not to exercise, and exactly (in
choosing a program of exercise)
what kind of exercise they wish to
explore. Students taking these
courses would have motivation. The
students would be able to choose
the type of exercise they want,
organized with others, and get pro-
fessional guidance from the depart-
ment, The department would have
to be more open to student sugges-
tions and student inspired courses.
The resources of the gym could be
more effectively utilized to meet the
needs of the university community.

The elimination of mandatory
physical education could set a prece-
dent of freedom of choice coupled
with personal responsibility. And it
is because of this, it seems a crucial
issue.

Washington and Lee’s Cross-

7-0 with a double win over David-

held at Davidson, the Generals de-

appeared “down” after losing to

Leading the harriers was Stu

of the second place finisher. Bill

ed third and fourth, respectively,
while Mike Burns and Bill Garrison
closed out W&L’s top five by plac-
ing 7th and 11th,

After the meet Coach Miller said
he was surprised that VMI didn’t give
the Generals more problems. It was
obvious that the Generals were

cross-town rivals, while the Keydets

this reasoning proved faulty.

The W&L’s harriers’ next test
will be a tough one. Bridgewater
comes to Lexington for what
promises to be a close meet. Bridge-

Lynchburg by more than W&L did
at a later date; however, W&L
defeated VMI by much more than
Bridgewater did.

Coach Miller has professed to

Generals Turn Tables
On Towson: Win 38-0

By LEWIS HIXSON

Ihe Towson State contest was
just the kind of game the Generals
needed after two losses in a row,
A 38-0 win was just what the doc-
tor ordered to get the Blue back on
the tract to a winning season, The
offense was poised and efficient as
it ground out 493 yards total offense
and the defense was the perfect
compliment as they limited Towson
to only 108 yards.

Tom Van Amburgh had a great
game as he rushed for 202 yards
and accounted for two touchdowns.
One came on a 54 yard run up the
middle and another when he threw a
30 yard halfback option to Chappy
Conrad for the score. Conrad also
had an exceptional game as he was
on the receiving end of 9 passes for
total of 126 yds. and 2 touchdowns.
His punting, although he didn’t do
it but two times, was very satis-
factory as he had a 43 yard aver-
age.

Steve Fluharty came back from
a dismal performance last week to
a rather good one as he completed
il of 19 for 127 yeards and a touch-
down, Lewis Powell has now pass-
ed for a 73 percent completion
percentage in the last two games as
he hit on 3 for 4 in this game.

The scoring began in the first
quarter when Fluharty led the Gen-
erals on a 43 yard drive in 12 plays.
Van Amburgh bore most of the
burden as he carried 8 times for
29 yards. Fluharty displayed the
Blue's game plan early, as he re-
peatedly sent his runners at the
Towson front wall. The score came
on a one yard sneak by Fluharty.
Chase added the extra point to put
the Generals up 7-0.

The next score came early in the
second period on another long drive.

This one consumed 14 plays. The
touchdown came on an 18 yard
pass from Fluharty to Conrad,

Chase added the extra point to put
the Generals up 7-0.

The next score came early in the
second period on another long drive.

~ The next

This one consumed 14 plays. The
touchdown came on an 18 yard
pass from Fluharty to Conrad.
Chase added his second point of
the afternoon to give Coach Leslie’s
squad a 14-0 lead,

touchdown didn’t take
long at all. Following a Towson
State punt, the Generals set up shop
at their own 31. Van Amburgh car-
ried three times, the first two going
for a total of 15 yards. Then on his
third carry, he went up the middle,
broke to the left sideline, and out-
ran everybody for a 54 yard scor-
ing jaunt. Once again, the extra
point was successful and at the half,
the Blue had a comfortable lead of
21 to 0.

The Blue scored twice in the third
quarter ,the first coming on a 29
yard field goal by Doug Chase, who
had his best afternoon of the sea-
son. The next score was quite a
play. Van Amburgh took a pitchout
and headed around right end. How-
ever, instead of running he pulled
up short and let fly a high pass that
Conrad grabbed, and took in fot
the score. The play covered thirty
yards, and brought back memories
of the old Reeves to Rentzel com-
bination of the Dallas Cowboys.
The extra point gave W&L a 31-0
lead,

The final touchdown came in the
last quarter on a drive engineered
by Lewis Powell. The drive covered
50 yards in 9 plays, with the score
coming on a 4 yard run by Lindsay,
The point after was good, and that
brought the count to 38 to Zip,
which was how the contest ended.

It was a well-played game by the
Generals who needed such a come-
back after their setback to Hamp-
den-Sydney., The defensive line did
a fine job, as they put tremendous
pressure on the Towson QB all day
The defensive secondary did a fine
job, allowing only 4 completed
passes for a total of 17 yards.

Senior Steve Fluharty turned in a
fine performance, one that will cer-
tainly earn him the starting job this

week, But Lewis Powell also per-
formed well, Coach Buck Leslie
seems to be caught in a George
Allen predicament. But as Jimmy
the Greek said this week, “It’s a
nice situation to be in.” Either way
he goes, Coach Leslie will have
fine signal caller,

This week the Blue will be at
Western Maryland in a game which
promises to be a fairly even match-
up. Western Maryland played
Hampden-Sydney last week and lost
by a score very comparable to
W&L’s, 28-6. One observer, a
Hampden-Sydney fan who saw both
Hampden-Sydney games, said that
this one promises to be a real
thriller. Western Maryland did man-
age one score off the Tiger defense.

Saturday's game at Westminster,
Md. is another must game for the
Generals. The losses to Centre and
Hampden-Sydney definitely put an
early damper on the season. This
was to be, and still could be a big
year for the Generals. This Satur-
day could tell the tale.

The Blue Soccer team will pursue a berth in the College Division Tournament when they take on Roanoke
today. The Generals will carry a 2-1-1 record into the game.

Blue Booters Caught By Indiana U.

By PAUL CAVALIERE

The Washington and Lee soccer
team, after a heart-breaking loss to
Madison College, found its winning
ways again with a very exciting 2-1
victory over past state champ Lynch-
burg College. It took W&L until
the first overtime period to hammer
out the win. There was an excep-
tionally large crowd to watch these
two skilled teams play.

The Generals only score during
the regular time period was by Jim
Fox in the first period with only
nine minutes gone in the half. He
was assisted on the play by Bill
Spofford. The entire game was
marked by excellent play on the
part of the Generals.

Lynchburg scored
with fifteen minutes
second half on a shot by their
center forward. Consequently the
regular time period ended in a 1-1
tie. When the two halfs end in a
tie the teams play two five minute
overtimes, Even if a team scores in
the first of the two overtime periods
both must be played. If the game
is still tied after the overtimes it
is written into the books as a tie.

Washington and Lee did manage
to score in the first overtime period,
The score was a beautiful shot by
right winger Mike Schaeffer with an
assist from right inside Jim Fox.
With this goal W&L still had to
stop Lynchburg from scoring dur-
ing the second overtime period,
Once this was done the Generals
walked away with a very rewarding
2-1 victory. The 110% Awards for
the Lynchburg game went to full-
backs Rolf Pirinian and John Gay-
lon for their tremendous defensive
efforts and Mike Schaeffer for his
outstanding work up front.

(Continued from Page 3)
Twain. He travels around the coun-
try and to such exotic places as
Europe and South America giving
his impressions of Mark Twain
much as Hal Holbrook does from
time to time on television.”

Trostle, who has had extensive
acting experience, has memorized
some four hours of vintage Mark
Twain and draws from this material
for his ninety minute monologue,
spontaneously adapting his material
to his particular audience.

Besides Twain’s unique sense of
humor and understanding of human
nature, much of the appeal is the
contemporary relevance of the fam-
ous writer’s thoughts and ideas.
Many of Twain’s remarks regarding
politics, man and society seem cur-
rent enough to have been written
today.

Reports columnist Ives: “Twain's
ideas concerning the importance of
man tend to punch holes in the

theory that man is some kind of
sacred being. ‘Man is the only
animal that blushes . .. or needs

to,’ Twain noted, and then added,
‘but you've got to remember that
he was made at the end of the
week's work.”

Wednesday's production is open
to the public, according to Ken
Lane, University Center Director,
“We are putting up publicity in
town and are trying to get the word
to area public schools as well,” he
added. Questions may be addressed
to Mr. Lane, at the University
Center, 463-9111, ext, 299.

Indiana U. Scores Tie
With W@L Generals, 2-2

(Continued from page 5)

was put in the game mid-way in
the first half and immediately scored
on an assist from Branden Herbert.
Later in the same half Embree
scored on an unassisted shot which
caught the upper right hand corner
of the goal. After this goal W&L
seemed to let down and just be con-
tent with a 2-0 lead.

Indiana came back in the second

half for two goals and sent the
game into overtime. Neither team
was able to score during these

periods and the game ended in a
tie. Emotionally it was just as good as
a loss because of the previous record
of Indiana. However it doesn’t hurt
the Generals standing since Indiana
is not in its league. The game was
very frustrating for the Blue since
they took thirty shots on the Indiana
goal as compared to only twelve
taken on the W&L goal. Late in
the game the ball just wouldn't go
in and when it did the refree called
the play back. | am referring to a
goal by Mike Schaeffer which was
called back because of an offsides
penalty.

The Generals record now stands
at 2-1-1. We have two games this
week, both away. Today the team is
at Roanoke College and next Wed-
nesday, October 25, the Generals
are at Randolph-Macon, Both of
these games are going to be tough,
especially the later. Washington and
Lee must win the rest its games with
Virginia Colleges in order to make
the small college tournament.

(Continued from Page 2)

Mickey Hart left the Dead to go
in a different musical direction after
they did Workingman’s Dead and
part of American Beauty. Since he
left, the Dead have been much more
country-oriented, This is good and
fine, but any competent musician
can do country music. The Dead
are capable of much more.

It's the sort of pure energy-force-
interreaction music that start off
high and gets higher as it goes. No
one but the Dead have really play-
ed that kind of music. Until now.
Cuts like “The Chase” and “Deep,
Wide, and Frequent” are the first
to come along for a while. It's
good to know that kind of music
is still happening.

Hart has all the big-names from
Frisco on one cut or another, Gar-
cia, Weir, and Lesh, as usual, are
themselves, which is the best thing
that can be said for a musician.
The horn section, from Tower of
Power, are becoming the best added-
on brass men available for studio
jobs like this one. John Cippolina,
late of Quicksilver, sounds as good,
if not better, than he did way back
when on Happy Trails,

The other Bay-area luminaries
come off well for the most part.
Grace Slick’s vocal on “Blind John”
is her best since the Starship album.
It may be the last thing she record-
ed before she started losing her
voice. David Freiberg proves once
and for all, on “Fletcher Carnaby”
that he will never be a good vocalist.
Without a doubt, it’s the worst cut
on the album,

Who Knows...

an onslaught of rumors concerning
the admittance of coeds to the
saunas. According to the rumors,
the athletic department is totally
against permitting women in the
saunas.

Not so, say the department offi-
cials. They say they have no ob-
jection to the use of the saunas
by women ... if bathing suits or
worn. Well, so much for that rumor,

But there are other, wilder rumors
concerning the closing of the saunas,
rumors which dare not even be
presented to the athletic department
for denial. “They” (left undefined
in the rumors) are hiding someone
or something in the saunas,

Who knows what could be locked
up in the sweaty depths of Doremus?
A group of radical W&L “hippie-
freaks?” The true story of the
Watergate bugging incident? Henry
Kissinger? Or Hank Sloss? “They”

In Sem Drama

Several W&L students and fac-
ulty members will be featured when
Southern Seminary presents Stop the
World, | Want to Get Off October

Christopher Cull, a freshman from
Wheeling, West Virginia, plays the
male lead as “Litthechap,” a char-
acter originally created by Anthony
Newley. Senior drama major Greg
Buch designed the set. Buch is a
veteran of several W&L Theater
productions. O, K. Barnes, W&L
drama instructor, provided technical
advice for the play.

The play, directed by Ellen
Barnes, “is a poignant musical

chines of the laundramat? We dared.
Putting our clothes into two wash-
ers, we fed in two quarters, The
machines began working!

We sat and waited for the clothes
to finish washing. We waited for
five minutes... ten minutes...
fifteen minutes . . . twenty minutes
. . « We waited thirty minutes as
the heat rose to hellish levels of
intensity—not counting the thirty
minutes we had waited before we
were able to get an unused washer.
Now that we had washed the clothes,
though, we had to go through
another ordeal: Drying the clothes.

After waiting 15 more minutes
for a dryer, we fed a dime into the
machine, and it began churning
away. We secured another machine
for the rest of the clothes. We wait-
ed, Finally after thirty more minutes,
the machines stopped. The clothes
were dry. Or were they? No, they
were still wet! We looked at each
other in grim silence. “Put two more
dimes in, boys,” I muttered through
clenched teeth, “It’s all we can do.”
Whimpering quietly we put in two
more dimes. And waited.

Finally, the thirty minutes was up!
So the clothes were finally dry,
right? Wrong! Some were still wet.
Leaving my two friends to their
own devices, I tossed my clean
clothes in my laundry bag and
dragged myself up the stairs to my
room.

| had been in the LAUNDRA-
MAT from 1:30 until 5:00, but now
my ordeal was over. Who would
have thought that next week I would
have the foolhearty bravado to do it
all over again?

comedy with a philosophical twist.”
It takes place in a circus tent and
is acted by clowns and mimes,

Stop the World has been called
“a new type of musical.” “It’s not
a funny musical,” said Mrs, Barnes.
“It's about the modern everyman
who becomes successful only to find
his success is empty. I chose the
play because I had to do a musical
and I felt it was more in line with
serious drama,”

Curtain time is 8 p.m. for both
performances. Reservations can be
made by calling 261-6181. Tickets
will also be on sale at the door,
$2.00 for adults, $1.50 for students.
