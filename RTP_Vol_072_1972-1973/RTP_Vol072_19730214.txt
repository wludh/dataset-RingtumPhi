Friedan, Gray Will Speak

Here In Contact Program

This week two more speakers
were announced for Contact °73 at
W&L. They are Betty Friedan,
author of The Feminine Mystique,
and L, Patrick Gray, currently act-
ing head of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation. They will speak on
March | and March 6 respectively.

Thus far four speakers have been
announced for the symposium, Ms,
Friedan and Mr. Gray will be joined
in the line-up by Dick Gregory and
Frank Mankiewicz,

Ms. Friedan is best known as a
leader in the feminist movement.
Her earliest contribution to the
movement was her book The Femi-
nine Mystique, published in 1963
after five years of research and
work. She first became concious of

male-oriented society while attend-
ing Smith College. In The Feminine
Mystique she brings to light the
difficulties women encounter in a
society which caters to the male sex
and how that society is re-enforced
in its male chauvinism by the media.

In 1966 Friedan organized the Na-
tional Organization for Women
(NOW). The purpose of this group
has been defined as the attempt to
bring women into American society
on an equal footing with the status
already enjoyed by the opposite sex.
Ms. Friedan continued in her cru-

‘Streetcar’: Just Another Trolley Ride

By BILL CHRIST

The University Theatre production
of Tennessee Williams’ “A Streetcar
Named Desire” opened last night
before a rabid audience comprised
primarily of VMI cadets, all bearing

marks of that tribe: circumcision
haircuts, oyster-sheel ears, and
eggious behavior, Whether force-

marched on a_ resented § cultural
reconaissance or else drawn into al-

tendance by a lurid tithe and ex-
pectations of a live porno show,
the cadets erected with their mis

timed guffaws an overarching kin-
ship with the priapic Pole, provid

ing Stanley Kowalski with a kind
of home court advantage in his
brutal battle against Blanche Du-

Bois and the magic of dreams

Despite this blood-curdling support,
however, there is no male passion,
no fusing heat generated by intimi-
dating intercourse, the crude con-
necting device wielded by Stanley
like a heavy wrench that terrorizes
the play into tragedy. Instead, the
University Theatre's rendition is un-
convincing, middling, flaccid,

As the play unzips (for it is a
drama of the phallus) Kowalski the
love-buicher tosses Stella her portion
of blood meat, which she clutches
close, and with excitement; it is the

the “gaudy seed-bearer” of

ley is albino, attenuated,

The program proclaims that this
is to be a new interpretation of the
role, one that is “quiet” and “cere-
bral,” an effort to boost Kowalski
up the ladder of evolution. Rieger's
iransiation is certainly not quiet;
Stanley hollers—in a gravelly, arid

ARefrain of Dem Old Coed Blues

It was decreed several weeks ago that, come Spring, we
students would have another opportunity to express our
opinions on coeducation for Washington and Lee. As all
but the freshmen will recall, the coed proposal fell to defeat
by a two-to-one margin in last year’s student body poll; many
opponents of the idea thereupon pronounced the issue dead
and all but buried.

As it turns out, however, the coeducation controversy is
not dead—merely dormant. This should come as no surprise,
for a couple of reasons, First, coeducation is still a strong
trend for institutions nationally, and such trends are not
dispelled by a single poll. Secondly, in this particular winter
of student discontent, it seems natural that the issue would
be resurrected; certainly, basic conditions haven't altered so
as to lead last year’s advocates of coeducation to abandon
their cause.

Most of us are already familiar with the arguments, both
pro and con, Last year a great deal of talk and energy was
expended on the topic; a special faculty subcommittee, headed
by Dr. Louis Hodges, presented a comprehensive report,
culled from a great deal of assiduous research, Many students
became intellectually and emotionally caught up with the
issue. All this oceurred—only to be deflated by the Spring
referendum results.

Before we embark on a replay of these efforts, several
points should be remembered. First, Washington and Lee is
fortunate in not being forced to make a decision about co-
education under pressure, Other colleges (Sewanee and David-
son come to mind) have found coeducation to be tied with
their future existence as competitive institutions; there is no
hard evidence to indicate that Washington and Lee is, or
will be, in this predicament. \dmissions standards, it seems,
will be more or less maintained, since numbers of applicants
have been steadily rising.

On the other hand, the fact that W&L does not face an
academic necessity to go coed is not, in itself, an argument
against going coed. In other words, the real strength of the
pro-coeducation position is not that W&L needs girls to assure
financial and academic stability; it is, rather, that coeducation
would bring a highly desirable qualitative change in W&L.

And this dichotomy, let's face it, is what the whole issue
boils down to—at least, in most students’ minds. There are
those, including most fraternity men, who are probably quite
happy, thank you very much, with the traditional all-male
lifestyle. They would prefer to be able to call the shots as to
when women are to be around and when they are not.

There is the other group which is basically bored with the
old down-the-road game; they feel that the campus would
profit, socially and intellectually, by the pressure of a feminine
contingent.

This is not meant to discount two other quite valid argu-
ments against coeducation: (a) that the change might mean
a larger enrollment and (b) that it would probably mean
considerable and amendation of the curriculum. We
suspect, though, that present size could be essentially sus-
tained and that the requisite financial adjustments could be
absorbed, if W&L students really wanted to take the plunge.

But what we're talking about is a very basic change in the
character of a Washington and Lee education, and the dil-
lemma is a tough one. There is no reason why W&L should

cost

pop up with me-tooism every time a hot and fashionable topic
comes along. Indeed, the case can very well be made that
W&L should remain as an all-male alternative in the quality-
college market.

Still, other institutions, similarly not under the gun, have
gone ahead with plans to open their doors to females. Dart-
mouth, Yale, and Harvard did not go coed because of admis-
sions problems; they had other, more encompossing reasons.
lt is a fact that here at W&L we are plagued with a rather
high attrition rate. Only some 63% of those who enroll as
freshmen ever go on to receive a degree——and, according to
many students who have considered transferring, W&L’s all
male status is a frequent and major reason.

The reckoning will come, then, this Spring, and if there is
no change in the student vote, the coeducation issue, in all
likelihood, will be put to rest for a good while longer, Mean-
while, it won't hurt to think about and discuss the subject,
intelligently and honestly, amongst ourselves, This may mean
re-hashing old arguments, but the issue is compelling enough,
we believe, to deserve the effort.

Independent Exams: An Assessment

By ROB GURNEE

With the new 12-12-6 calendar in
1970 came independent exams, and
the popularity of the system is ap-
parently still on the rise. In a recent
poll taken by the EC, the Washing-
ton and Lee community voted over-
whelmingly in favor of the present
independent scheduling system.

Since the poll, many students have
expressed curiosity as to the position
of the faculty and administration in
regard to this issue. So this past
week, the Ring-tum Phi talked with
several members of the faculty and
administration to determine how the
system originated and the past and
present sentiments of the faculty re-
garding the current exam plan.

In the winter of 1970, the Stu-
dent Curriculum Committee present-
ed an exam plan they thought would
fit well into the new calendar system
for the 1970-71 school year. The
exam plan was submitted to the fac-
ulty Executive Committee for re-
view, and the committee rejected
the proposal. The administration
then contacted seevral other schools
which had independent exams to de-
termine whether they were success-
ful. During that time the Student
Curriculum Committee revised the
exam plan and resumbitted it to the
faculty EC. This time the plan was
adopted,

We talked with Dr. Louis Hodges,
professor of religion and a member
of the 1970 faculty EC.

“Il originally had serious doubts
about independent exams,” said Dr,
Hodges. “Certainly it puts a greater
burden on the student—the oppor
tunity for cheating is greater.

“From a faculty viewpoint, in
many cases independent exams make
the grading process more difficulty,”
cominued Hodges. “Many of us
don't like to grade any of the exams
until they all are received for rea-
sons of greater objectivity. When
exams come floating in all week, it
puts quite a rush on us to grade the
papers and submit the grades within
a couple of days.

“IT think, however, that the system
as it is is working out quite well, If
a vote were taken today probably
65 to 75% of the faculty would
favor the current system,’

Dr. William Jenks, professor of

history, also opposed independent
exams at first
“A sysiem such as this has the

best chance to work in a close-knit
college community where students
live. eat, and owe allegiance to each

other. A sense of trust is cultivated
if an environment such as that of
Sweet Briar.” said Dr. Jenks

Many students feel that WA&l
breeds such a trust. Junior Tom
Faulkner would like to see even
greater freedom during the exam

perind

“The exam period would be better
if the students could take exams any
time during the week without being
bound by a signed exam folder.
Also I see no reason why a student
can't take his exam where he desires.
The opportunity to cheat is present
with the current system and those
who would cheat will do it anyway.”

The great majority of students
favor a reading day before the exam
period and we talked with Assistant
Dean Robert McAhren about that
possibility.

“As you know, a reading day is
scheduled before the winter exams,
but the time factor forbids the extra
day before the Christmas holidays.
So if the student needs a reading day
he has the freedom of leaving the
first day of exams open on his sche-
dule.”

McAhren continued, “Il am pleased
with the way the independent exam

Letters

Is Doremus for Students?

lo the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

As one of the many Washington
and Lee students who like to use
Doremus Gym on the weekends, I
feel that it is time to raise a com-
plaint. Two weeks ago, on a Sat-
urday afternoon, there were around
forty people playing basketball in
the old gym when Coach Miller in-
formed us that we would have to

leave because a girls’ gymnastics
meet was scheduled for that after-
noon,

It just so happened that a wrest
ling maich was in progress in the
new gym, so we had nowhere to go,
li seems to me that this is a very
good example of very poor planning.
| was under the impression that one
reason the new gym was built was
so that the entire student body could
use the facilities to a greater extent
than in the past. | am all for making
the gym available to the Lexington
community for its needs, but on a
Saturday afternoon when the other
gym is already in use?

| would suggest that the athletic
department either take a little more
consideration for the students
when it decides to reserve an entire
gym for outside groups, or that it
find some place other than a main
gym to conduct girls gymnastics
meets. Is this any way fo run a gym
nasium? | don't think so

system has gone. Certainly it avoids
test conflicts that were present with
the block exam system. The burden,
however, is not with the administra-
tion, but with the student. The suc-
cess or failure of independent exams
depends on the respect that the stu-
dents have for the system and them-
selves.”

Just what is the student's burden?
We talked with past Student Body
Presidents Fran Lawrence and Steve
Robinson and the current President
Bob Brennan, all of whom suggested
that independent exams are unique
in relation to the honor system.

“With the exams,” said Brennan,
“the responsibility of the student
doesn't end when he walks out of the
test. Instead the biggest responsibil-
ity is still on his shoulders. Complete
silence is the only way to handle in-
dependent exams.”

This seems to be the general feel-
ing among the faculty, adminisira-

cropping up, both in this paper and
elsewhere on campus, regarding
minority student recruitment. My in-
terest is in the larger context of the
question of how Washington and
Lee will adapt as an educational in-
stitution to the 1970's,

In an article entitled “The New
Change magazine (Feb.
1973) suggests that higher education
in this decade will be shaped to a
large extent by a new clientele of
students, The article defines
“New Students” as coming from one
of four “distinctive but overlapping
groups: 1.) low
who are gaining enirance through
open admissions; 2.) adults and part
time learners who are gaining access
through nontraditional

E.C, member Bob Keatley sug-
“Value judgments (i.e. the
test was hard, or the test was easy)
given out after a test are the E.C,'s
greatest concern. It can be just as
damaging for a student to give out
this information as it is to openly
cheat on an examination.”

Everyone seems to be adjusting
well to our current system on inde-
pendent exams, Almost all faculty
members agreed that they were
pleased with the way the last exam
period went. Many students com-
mented that the independent exam
system was one of the main attrac-
tions leading to their enrollment here
at W&L.

Dr. Hodges said it best when he
commented, “The chances for the
continued success rest with the stu-
dents. They can respect it and make
it work, or abuse it and shut it down,
That's the way it looks to me.”

Preston Sounds Off

The only formal wear to be seen

“Daddy Rabbit,” the opening act of

“that’s the way God planned it.”

Daddy Rabbit is made up of five
students, four of them from W&L.

knowledge of their limitations, and
a good bit of versatility as well, On

Overall, Daddy Rabbit was an im-
pressive opening act.

Billy Preston, when he finally got
on stage, was ready to go, and he
did. Preston is a showman from the
word go, and his abilities as a musi-
cian are not lacking, at least on key-
boards,

Preston played a wide variety of
material, but everything he did had
the same underlying spirit, which
would be something like, “We're all
God's children, so let’s rock ‘n’ roll
tonight.”

Preston had a certain combina-

plain movement which allowed him
to change styles freely, and yet seem
to be continuing what he had just

just that: secondary support, but
essential nevertheless, With their
rhythm driving underneath, Preston
didn’t have as far to climb to pass
that critical point a concert artist
must surpass to get himself and the
audience off.

He probably could have done it
with just an acoustic piano, but it

Films In Review

Skinnerian Horror

By MARK McMINN
Stanley Kubrick’s most recent film,
A Clockwork Orange, is about good
and bad and the choice between or
the lack thereof, It revolves around
a character named Alex, whose
principle interests are rape, ultra-
violence, and Ludwig van Beetho-
ven. Yet Kubrick’s handling of each
of these elements makes A Clock-
work Orange, in this writer’s opi-
nion, a rather unique film,

Malcolm McDowell turns in an
extremely credible performance as
Alex, a character who is the very
personification of evil, yet a person
portraying great candor, wit, and
intelligence: winning qualities which
would seem to invite the viewer's
sympathy, But Kubrick stops there,
giving the viewer a character who is
totally aware of his own wickedness
and making no attempt to deceive
the audience as to his corruption.

Alex and his band of droogies
prey upon other gangs and the pub-
lic, deriving immense pleasure
through their own stylized form of
violence. One of the more unique—
and one of the more violent—scenes
in the film concerns a danse macab-
re of sorts involving the confronta-
tion of Alex and his band and an-
other gang in a ballet of bloodshed.
The scene is edited in such a way
that each thrust of a club, each kick
in the groin, coincides perfectly with
the beat of Beethoven's Ninth. The
twist is such that the viewer is im-
pressed by the brutality of Alex and
his droogies while the actual flow
of blood is conspicuously absent.

Alex and his band go on to per-

petuate their image, entering the
home of a political activist under

false pretenses, doing bodily harm
to the household head and raping
his wife, all choregraphed to the tune
of “Singing in the Rain.” Again, a
different, and, I think, unique twist.
(Kubrick handles another interim
scene after a similar fashion where
Alex has intercourse with two girls

picked up in a Chelsa Drugstroe

filmed in pixilation and to the rhy
thm of Rossini’s William Tell Over-
ture.) Under the same false pre
tenses which gained him entry to
the home of the activist, Alex is ad
mitted into the home of The Cat

Woman, This time he is betrayed by
his droogies and is captured by the
police. Told by his
ficer that he has run out of excuses,
Alex

probation of
is sent off to prison

It is at prison that Alex
teers for the Ludovico ‘Treatment.
Seeing it as a way out of his pre
dicament, Alex willingly
himself to the behaviorist’s theory
of stimulus-response and is extin
guished through films depicting rape
violence and Beethoven. Herein lies
the depreviation of choice: Alex is
conditioned in such a that
he has neither the choice to be good
nor evil. He than
human: an orange, organic, but act-
ing like clockwork: restrained, but
not redeemed.

here are two other
the film which attention
Phe first is set design. While the film
is Situated in London and much use
is made of city locations, the
themselves lend a futuristic tone to
the film. The viewer is impressed
with the present and future implica
tions of the environment. The second
is the sound track. The music of
Beethoven with the added dimension
of Walter Carlos, innovator of the
Moog Synthesizer, leaves the listen
er with a sense of past and present

As a result, the implication is
frightening. The viewer would prefer
to believe that the situation of Alex
is too far into the future to demand
immediate concern. Yet, the student
of psychology knows that “a clock
work orange,” in the Skinnerian
sense, is old hat. The penetration of
the brain by electrodes is the cur-
rent thing.

The past, present, and future will
be at the State Theatre Wednesday

Doremus Plaques Honor

Dom Flora and Cy Young

By PAUL SIMPSON

After W&L’s victory over Bridge-
water two weeks ago, the ma-
jority of spectators walked past a
wall with numerous plaques adorn-
ing it. Very few, if any, stopped to
look at them, Although most of the
awards are for lacrosse (which is
undoubtedly THE sport at W&L),
two of the non-lacrosse awards
honor athletes whose feats might
surprise a lot of people.

One is a basketball award given
to Dom Flora when he was named
to the ten man All-American team
in 1958. As the all time W&L scor-
ing leader, in 1958 he became the
fifth highest scorer ever in the na-
tion’s history.

A 6'2” guard, he was one of the
last’ W&L men to receive a full
athletic scholarship for any sport,
He constantly drew praises from
opposing coaches and his lowest
game as a senior was seventeen
points,

Consistency was one of Flora’s
main attributes and this led to his
being named an All-American. On
the first team with him were Elgin
Baylor, Oscar Robertson, Bob
Boozer and Wilt Chamberlain, Flora
beat out another guard for the
first team position who many con-
sider to be a pretty good ball player,
Jerry West.

  
   

a

the athletic department to succeed,

About the same time that Dom
Flora was tearing up the hardwood
courts in Doremus Gymnasium, the
man serving as alumni secretary
was named Harry K. (Cy) Young,

Young was probably the greatest
all-around athlete W&L has ever
seen, The plaque on which you
can find his name is the one given
when he was inducted into the Na-
tional Football Hall of Fame (in
1958),

From 1913-17, “Cy” Young won
sixteen letters (four in each of four
sports: baseball, football, basketball
and track) and captained each team
he was on,

In baseball, “Cy” was the leading
hitter, scorer and base stealer. In
track he ran the 100 yard dash in
9.8 seconds. In basketball he was
twice All-Athletic Foundation All-
American team and led the team to
an undefeated season in 1917.

Best known for his football feats,
“Cy” was a halfback until an in-
jury forced him into the quarter-
back position. At this time, W&L
was playing Army, Navy, Cornell,
etc., the nation’s powerhouses,

Even so, in 1914, “Cy” led the
team to a 9-0 record and in 1913
he anchored the best defense in the
nation (allowing 9 points all year)
and the fourth best offense nation-
ally,

B’Ballers Stay Even;
Tigers Loom Ahead

By JIM MOZINGO

The W&L Generals managed to
keep their record above .500 this
past week, losing to Lynchburg 91-
82 and beating York 84-67. It was
one of the Generals’ easiest sched-
ules, with the Shippensburg game
cancelled.

Coach Verne Canfield isn't really
pleased with the week lay-off be-
tween games, especially considering
the foe Saturday night is Hampden-
Sydney, looking for revenge after an
early season defeat at the hands of
the Generals.

The games this past week afforded
quite a contrast. The game at
Lynchburg was close and well offici-
ated, and Lynchburg, though they
didn't show it much of the game,
has a good ball club.

On the other hand, the game at
York was under poor playing condi-
tions, poorly officiated, and the op-
position left something to be de-
sired. W&L shot 32% and _ still
won by 17 points,

Lynchburg put up a great fight,
though the game wasn't particularly
well played by either team. Regula-
tion time ended with the game tied
78-78. W&L had been bothered by
the Lynchburg press throughout the
game, and had trouble all night
getting the ball in the hoop. The
concensus seems to be that we
should have won the game in regula-
tion time, but in the overtime it was
all LC, as they outscored W&L
13-4,

The Generals returned to the court

Saturday night against York Col-
lege. Unfortunately someone had
left the covers on the baskets and
the Generals continued their hor-
rendous shooting streak, There were
several bright spots however; Skip
Lichtfuss managed to pry open the
nets for 28 points while also pull-
ing down 14 rebounds, But the real
rebounding show was put on by
Guy Kerr and Paul McClure who
got 17 each. These three accounted
for 48 rebounds, and allowed W&L
to dominate the boards. The only
problem here seems to be the num-
ber of rebounds coming off.

With his 28 points Saturday, Skip
Lichtfuss moved to within 17 points
of 1,000 for his career at W&L.
Skip could get them Saturday against
Hampden-Sydney.

Washington and

the scourge of the rest of the CAC,

They have already defeated Centre
three times, the fewest by 15 points.
Sawanee is the team to watch for
in the tournament; they should pose
the chief obstacle to W&L hopes.

Sewanee has an added advant-
age—they are playing in their own
gym. Canfield has been able to
play his whole bench the last couple
of weeks which should help, not
only for the tournament, but for
next year. The bench has encount-

W&L “Robinhood” Shoots For Olympics

By JAMES BAIRD

Mark Miller is not your ordinary
freshman. He is a national champion
in the relatively unknown sport of
archery. Once necessary for survival
in the wilds, the bow and arrow is a
familiar sight from summer camp
days, but many would not recognize
the equipment the competitive archer
uses today.

Archery, as a sport, has only re-
cently begun to gain popularity in
the United States, however, it is
now possible for an athlete to gain
all-American recognition in it. This,
among other things, is one of the
goals Mark has set for himself. In
May of 1972, he entered the Na-
tional high school championships
representing the state of Wisconsin.
He competed in the boys division
and the international round division
and captured both titles with new
records in each.

From that victory, which Mark
feels was his greatest accomplish-
ment, he went on to the Olympic
trials in Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Wis-
consin, and Minnesota. The Olympic
committee picks a select field of
30 from all those who compete in
the trials and these 30 all meet
at Miami of Ohio for an elimina-
tion tournament, Out of this comes
three people who represent the

* * * *

U.S. at the Olypics. Mark didn’t
quite make it that far, but the
thought of representing the U.S. did
capture his imagination, and hope-
fully he plans for another try in
1976.

In a week's time, Mark shot in
one Olympic qualifier, the Men's
National Championship at Miami of
Ohio where he finished in the top
10%, and in the Wisconsin state
championship where he finished
fourth individually and won the team
championship.

Needless to say, it was a tough,
grueling week. Archery competition
is divided into indoor and outdoor
meets. Indoors, the archer will shoot
10 arrows from 20 yards in what
is called a PAA round, Outdoors,
where most international competi-
tion is shot, is more difficult. The
archer shoots 144 arrows in what
is called a F.1.T.A. round. Thirty-
six arrows are shot at 90 meters,
36 at 70 meters, 36 at SO meters,
and at 30 meters, These are timed
events. The competitor is given 2.5
minutes to shoot three arrows, When
he has completed shooting, he sits
down and the next competitor is

given 2.5 minutes to shoot three
arrows. When he has completed

shooting, he sits down and the next
competitor starts his timed shooting.

When competing indoors, Mark
is shooting at a target 22 inches in
diameter with a 3.2” bulls eye. On
the outdoor ranges shooting from
distances of 90 and 70 meters the
target is 48 inches in diameter with
a 9 inch bulls eye. From 50 to 30
meters the target is 34 inches in
diameter.

The pressure is intense. In inter-
national competition Mark says,
“one bad arrow can blow it all.”
Constant practice is necessary to
keep the body in shape and the eye
sharp. Equpiment must also be of
the highest quality. Mark uses a
Hoyt Pro medalist bow equipped
with stabilizer rods, counter balance
and sight with extension. His ar-
rows, which sell for about $50 a
dozen are fashioned from aluminum
and are equipped with feathers for
indoor shooting or plastic vanes for
outdoor shooting. They are 27”
long. Mark's bows cost him in the
neighborhood of $260 each with-

When Mark came to Washington

academics. Many schools, recogniz-

and other benefits in order to get
him to represent their school. Mark
considered them all and decided that
WAL would suit him best.

Letters to the athletic director
followed, where Mark explained his
desire to continue to compete in
archery competition representing
Washington and Lee. In effect, he
would be the school's archery team.
The return letters were enthusiastic;
the school would provide a place to
shoot and the necessary facilities.
Mark didn't ask for much. He would
provide his own targets, he had his
own equipment, and he would mark
off the necessary distances by him-
self. All that was needed were a
few bales of hay and a place to

Tankers Capture First VCAA;
Tough State Meet Lies Ahead

The Washington and Lee swim
team wrapped up its first state cham-
pionship on Saturday, with a re-

score is still being contested, but as
it stands, the Generals outdistanced

ards of the Yellow Jackets was the
only triple winner. He grabbed the

W&L had several dual winners. John
Henzel won the 100 and 200 butter-
fly, Bill Tiers won the 500 and the
1650 freestyle, and Rob Searles ap-
parently won the 400 Individual

apparently, we mean he did swim and
win the races, but the VCAA might
disqualify him because he had been
disqualified in another meet.

With this first state championship
under their belts, the swimmers will
go after the big one this weekend in

The Wonderful World of Swizzling At W&L

tain two gallons.

After removing from the fire and
allowing to cool a little add a half
cake dissolved yeast to lukewarm
mixture. Mix and strain into a five-
gallon crock. Allow it to ferment in
a cool place three days. At the end
of this period skim the mixture and
siphon into two dozen beer bottles.
Store bottles on their sides for at
least a week. Longer aging improves
the flavor and the quality of the
drunk which must follow for full
enjoyment,

Beer can be bought at innumer-
able establishments in the hamlet
which proves that you really can
buy happiness, even in Lexington.
Bottled bliss is distributed in the
greatest quantity at the Quid,

Korger, A&P, and East Lexington
Grocery. Old Mil and PBR
are $1.49 at Kroger, $1.34 at A&P.
and $1.39 at Bast Lex. Duck's
prices are just a little higher than
the highest of these. He charges
$1.60 for a six of Old Mil, the same
kind sold for a dime less at Kroger
and 20c-25¢ cheaper at the other
two stores named,

Whatever else you plan to under-
take this term, do cultivate your
relationship with a six pack of brew.
You will certainly find it to be one
of your most rewarding and memor-
able college experiences. So take
your fill of good cheer and good
beer and remember, as the obscure
Stanlicus said, “he who drinks a
brew a day will live to die some
other way.”

freshman Rick Heldrich gave W&L
the lead for good as he completely
dominated Loyola's Kevin Corker
in the last two periods to post a
4-0 decision,

Doug Ford (167) wasted no time
in his match pinning his man mid-
way through the first period to be-
come the second General to win
ten matches (Stieff was the first
when he won earlier in the after-
noon). Sam Lewis then gave W&L
a comfortable lead when he de-
cisioned his man 5-2 to up the team
score to 21-10. About this time
Coach Piper was undoubtedly think-
ing about last year’s match with

this same Loyola team when with
W&L leading 22-10 with two
matches to go, Loyola won the
final contests on pins to salvage a
tie.

Lanny Rainey (190) set his coach's
mind at ease when he pushed his
man all over the mat for a period
and a half (running up a 14-2
score) before pinning his man. This
clinched the match for the Generals
and removed all pressure from Dave
Powers who lost a decision to close
the meet.

The match provided a _ good
chance for the team to tune up for
today’s VCAA meet in which Wash-
ington and Lee will play the host
school,

Letters To The Editor

flexible enough to accept a limited
number of “high risk” students, i.e.
students who in their College Board
scores and past grades offer no guar-
antee that they can function ade-
quately within our present curri-
culum,

But if we do so, we must either
add on new remedial programs to
our curriculum or make the curri-
culum itself more flexible so that a
student who does not have a quality
academic background in the tradi-
tional sense can still function ade-
quately and effectively here.

| would like to argue that we ac-
commodate a wider diversity of stu-
dent clientele by working towards a
more flexible curriculum; further-
more, that we do this without lower-
ing the standards of performance
which we demand of students, What
such a step would ask of us is that
we make some shifts in our attitudes
toward what higher education is all
about. | close with a quote from the
article mentioned above:

“We might do well to give up our
preoccupation with correcting the
“deficiencies” of New Students (stu-
dents from the four groups mention-
ed above) and concentrate instead
on developing the new range of tal-
ents and interests that they bring to

higher education. ‘College-level’
work need not mean higher and
higher levels of abstraction; it might
well mean higher and higher stand-
ards of performance.

“In any event, our new educa-
tional purposes suggest that we be-
gin with the student and help move
him toward the development of his
abilities. It does not suggest that we
try to make him into a pale carbon
copy of the academically elite lead-
er of by gone days.”

shoot.

Since Mark has been here he has
competed in one tournament and
before it he had only one day to
practice. The school had given him
permission to use the field adjacent
to the soccer fields, but the bales
of hay were late in coming. They
were eventually set up one day
before the tournament and Mark
had little time to prepare for the
meet. His showing was not too bad
considering these conditions,

After the Christmas break, the
hay disappeared and the Athletic
Department has taken an exhorbi-
tant time to produce more. Some
were actually set up this Monday,
but this hardly seems the way to
treat this type of talent. Mark has
no coach here at W&L. Coach Dick
Miller signs the necessary forms
and papers which Mark needs to
compete, but that is al Ithe help
he normally gets.

Perhaps abuse is
Perhaps W&L's lack of response
comes from a misunderstanding.
However, Washington and Lee
stands to lose a potential Olympic
competitior, unless a more favor-
able atmosphere is generated.

The United States Intercollegiate
Championship will be held in Penn-
sylvania in May. The all-American
team will be chosen from this
group. Mark would like to make it
for Washington and Lee,

Hatton Smith is out for the rest of
the season with an apendectomy,
He will be replaced by Frosh guard
John Podgajny.

Though the Generals haven't
played as well as Coach Canfield
and others thought they might have
this season, Canfield still professes
to have the utmost faith in his team.
He says this team wants badly to
bring home a winner. With a record
of 11-10 and four games left, the
Generals at least should split these
games 2-2 and maybe better. They

should get their winning season.

‘Streetcar’ Lacks Raw Passion

(Continued from page 1)
ing, melting, like mournful blues in-
to a tonality of tears,

Martha Evans, as slender and
bright as Sunday morning sunlight
through swooning curtain, is a cap-
able Stella, sex-mesmerized and
stuffed with dreaminess after pas-
sion, demon-eyed in anger at her
husband’s mistreatment of Blanche,
yet ultimately servile to sense.
Quite nimble for a pregnant woman,
Stella fairly dribbled that belly
along with her on sprints in search
of outrage.

Mark Daughtrey is a disappoint-
ment. His protrayal of Mitch, the
mama's boy who reaches first to
comfort, then to rape the haggard
Blanche, is a diminishing solidity.
His early scenes as the gawky but
eager cavalier with slumping should-
ers and pocket-protected hands are
efficacious. But when Blanche dis-
closes her responsibility for the death
of her boy-husband, Daughtrey
stares at her like a street lamp.
There also seemed to be a problem
of positioning, for Mrs. Kahn, after
a truly stirring confession, was fore-
ed to hop-wallow like an amputee
into Mitch’s sealing arms, (Indeed,
the entire play was characterized by
the performers’ inability to embrace
or rape naturally.)

After Stanley cleaves Blanche’s
past into a sordid cross-section for
Mitch, the spart-parts man rushes
to her to vent his wrath in the Ko-
walski manner. Daughtrey infects
the scene with ruinous slapstick,
rubber-legged, Groucho Marx strid-
ing, epileptic torso-twitching, and a
hollow, metallic voice, spitoon-
toned,

One does not feel the power of
desire from this production, the need
to grind flesh to flesh in frantic
endeavor to fill the emptiness where
there is no love. Without human
passion, desperate to stall the in-
