Page 2 THE RING-TUM PHI

OUTLOOK and REVIEW
The Floundering Fate Of The Phi

We W&L journalists, like old townies, enjoy reminiscing
about the Good Old Days. And actually, well within the
the present seniors, things were much better on

 

   

memory of
the campus journalism scene—at one time Washington and
Lee boasted two weekly editions of the Ring-tum Phi in
competition with each other, along with healthy staff num-
bers for the Ariel and the Calyx.

The annual election of Editors and Business Managers
used to be an intense and drawn-out affair, sometimes lasting
through the early morning hours. Competition on staffs was
extremely keen, and the jockeying for positions was exciting
and sometimes agonizing. In fact, in a typical year there were
as many as eight to ten people applying for each editorship,
for both the yearbook and the campus newspaper.

This interest in W&L journalism quickly waned a few
years ago. The Publication Board Elections have degenerated
into a rubber-stamp formality simply to confirm the appoint-
ments of the few persons that bothered to apply for the jobs.
For the past three years there has been no opposition in the
contest for Editor-in-Chief of either the Calyx or the Ring-
tum Phi.

Needless to say, this all adds up to a very distressing state
of affairs. To be sure, lack of competition for editorships is
merely a reflection of an overall decline in involvement in
many extra-curricular activities. But in publications, the prob-
lem is especially acute.

For this reason (as pointed out in the article on page one),
the Publications Board, in a meeting just before Spring break,
decided to appoint only a provisional editor for the Ring-tum
Phi—pending their decision, to come next month, on whether
or not to cease publication of the newspaper altogether.

The prospect of abolishing the Ring-tum Phi may come
as a shock to some, but, in the opinion of the Board, it seemed
like the only proper response at a time when participation in
these activities seems to be at an all-time low.

We are at somewhat of a loss to figure out why students
have failed to involve themselves in this area, Over sixty
current freshmen served as editors of their high school news-
paper; indeed, the figures are similar for the other three
classes as well. Yet none of these students is presently serving
on the Phi staff.

We concede that this lack of interest may be due, in large
part, to our own failure in recruiting efforts. Moreover,
neither the Ring-tum Phi nor the Calyx are in any way
connected with the School of Journalism, and, therefore, can
offer no academic credit for writing and editing.

furthermore, it could very well be that the Ring-tum Phi
is no longer meeting the needs of the students and the W&L
community in general. If so, we want to know about it—and
we have placed a questionnaire on the back page which we
hope each student will take the time to fill out,

But we still harbor the suspicion that W&L needs a
campus newspaper in some form. The argument has been
made that W&L is by nature dull, and, therefore, a news-
paper is condemned to reflect that dullness. Nevertheless, a
really good college newspaper will search out issues and stir
up interest in various university affairs.

This we have tried our best to do, No doubt we have
pleased a few (and angered many more) with our reports and
columns concerning fine arts, the drug bust, voting registra-
tion, black recruitment, coeducation, and the student elections.
ur purpose has been very simple: to provide accurate re-
porting and, at the same time, provocative and admittedly
opinionated observations on campus news,

We feel that such a service would be sorely missed were
the Phi to fold at the end of this year. Now would be a perfect
time for interested and able students, regardless of previous
to come forth and help to rejuvenate interest in
W&L publications. The Ring-tum Phi will hold a staff re
cruitment meeting next Wednesday, April 25, in Room 208
Center at 7 pan. Freshmen, sophomores,

‘ \perie nee,

of the University
and juniors are all urged to attend,

We realize that Phi, in its 80-year-old history, may have
outlived its usefulness; perhaps it shoud be abolished to make
new. fresh vehicle for student expression, One

way tor some

thing is certain: the W &l. student newspaper can be any)

thing its readers want it to be—as long as they show enough

interest to keep it going.

From time to time, we will
bring you short profiles of mem-
bers of the campus community
who have gone unnoticed but
have dedicated themselves to the
school. In this, a first in a series,
we focus on Mr. Detrick W. Ward,
a 20-year employee of the school
and director of plant and prop-
erty, grounds and maintenance,

When we entered the office of
Mr. Ward, located in the tractor
shed behind the ROTC building,
right behind the John Deere Leaf
Sweeper, he had just finished
lighting his pipe. The stringent
odor caused raised eyebrows
amongst our research staff but
Ward quickly rose to his feet and
shook hands warmly. On closer
inspection, Mr. Ward had com-
mon leaves stuffed into his pipe.
When questioned, Ward grinned,
“Yep, where do you think all
those leaves we collect in the ‘all
go? We have to get rid of them
somehow, I make all my staff
smoke ‘em! We settled back and
began the interview.

“IT never thought I'd like it
here,” mused Ward as he put food
into the small fish tank he has
in his office, “After a while
though, this place sort of grows
on you, like Algae Sporotaneous.”

We asked Director Ward what
innovation during the 20 years
was the hardest to implement and
introduce to the University com-
munity.

“No doubt about it,” he said as
he puffed anew on his pipe, (a
brilliant orange maple leaf was
being stubborn and would not
ignite), “The whole place couldn't

age trench behind the Gym was

ing. Many say we lost that new
wing built in ’50 in the mud slide
because of that trench but I think
not. Anyway, the new gym is
built and we don’t have to worry
about that anymore.” Ward con-
cluded his statement on the gym
by saying that in his opinion,
the whole structure should have
been built facing the other way.
When asked why, Ward became
despondent and refused to com-
ment further.

Changing course, we now asked
Mr. Ward about his much-touted
“Project Cosmetic” that he has
been championing for some 15
years. At the mention of this,
Ward turned from the fish tank
where he had been making
strange cooing noises at a striped
porgy and smiled. “That project
was to be my one big contribu-
tion to Washington and Lee. I
was going to collect items for
each department that would en-
hance not only the individual de-
partment but the whole school as
well. Ward gave but three or four
examples of what he meant, “The
most difficult was going to be
the complete hip bone of St.
Francis of Assisi for the Religion
Department.” he said, “But that

photographie portfolio for the
English Department of Oscar
Wilde’s summer on the Darde-

nelles with his “good friends” was
a treasure as well.” Mentioned
briefly in addition to the above
were the Philosophy Department’s
inheritance of the rare voiume,
The Life Of Bennet Cerf, (lime-
rick portfolio included), and the
Spanish Department’s gift of a
vial of the stuff that Joselito
slipped in when he was gored
to death in Pamplona in '93. We
asked Director Ward where he

all along. Maybe you're afraid of
it, but it’s still there. If you think
vou can’t get there from here,
listen to Birds of Fire, The least
you'll find out is that some people
can.

You ean call it jazz, rock, jazz-
rock, or anything else, It isn't
true jazz, because it was painrs-
takingly sculptured in studios,
but the freedom of jazz permeates
the sound.

John MeLaughlin resolved his
duality by putting the 12-string
and G-string guitar into one in-
strument. Two necks mean much
more than twice as much sound
when used correctly. McLaughlin
doesn't really put out any more
sound, but it comes far clover to
perfection than his previous 6-
string work.

He has assembled a consort
which can go farther because it
travels together. Nobody sounds
out of place in this group because
they're all headed in the same
constant direetion: straight up.

The Country Club Groundskeeper

was going to get funds to pur-
chase these undoubtably priceless
articles.

“Oh yes, the funds. Well, 1
first thought that I would take
a collection from the students, A
little from each one would soon
have given me _ the_ required
amount. If it wasn’t for the
trouble in ’54 I probably would
have had the dough.”

We instantly picked up on the
referendum and pressed our ques-
tions. Ward was, at first, reluctant
to answer but complied after our
staff complimented him on the
arrangement of the fish tank ac-
cessories, especially the little
castle which bubbled.

“T guess it started when I be-
gan cutting the grass and sweep-
ing the leaves around the Quad
in the early morning, you know,
around 4 o'clock. For some reason
the students didn’t seem to favor
this hour for me to do my work.
At first the letters I received
were discarded because | thought
that these students were alone
in their complaints, Even after
several students came to visit
me down here I regarded them
as a minority. I believe it was
after the effigy of me was burned
in front of my house did I realize
that these kids have a real beef.
It was too late though for any
money collecting.”

The embarrassed silence in the
room was too much for Ward and
he rapidly changed the subject.

“If you guys want, I can tell
you a little about my new pro-

ject, “Operation Abyssinia,” which

I'm going to submit for approval
in the Spring, when it gets
warmer.”

“The project encompasses the
Main Campus, that is, the Colon-

marized concluding didactic argu-
ments than anything else, and the
sound is convincing.

The rest of the album is any-
thing but tedious, and its mes-
sage is really one of total

urgency. It encompasses what he
called sadjoy on an earlier album
(Extrapolation, Polydor PD 5510,
in case you're interested, and if
you like Birds of Fire, you will
be interested).

 

Maravishnu John McLaughlin,

nade, My plan is to decorate the
facades of each of the main build-
ings with the refuse and litter
our boys pick up around campus,
The project’s name comes from
those fancy mosaics they have in
Persia. We plan to coat the now-
existing bricks with a light plastic
layer and imbed the refuse into
it. When the whole thing dries,

you'll have a sort of mosaic
effect.”
“Tl figure if we can find the

right materials we can even make
pictures of Lee and Jackson on
horseback saluting each other or
something. Visitors to the campus
will be impressed to no end, what

do you think?”
Almost simultaneously our
whole staff looked at their

watches and chorused that it was
getting late and that we had bet-
ter be going.

“Before you smiled) Mr.
Ward, “Have something to hold
you over to dinner.”’ He produced
what looked like packs of gum.
We graciously accepted and left,
thanking him for his time. On
returning to our offices we found
that, true to our suspicions, the
packs contained beech and elm
leaves,

go,”

There it is, an oh, so short,
glimpse of one of the men who
run this campus smoothly and
efficiently. Our hats are off to
you, Mr. Ward, and we wish you
many continued years of happi-
ness and creativity. Anyone who
wishes to visit Director Ward may
do so any time between 12:00 and
1:00 Monday through Friday. It
is imperative however, that the
visits be kept to a 15 minute
limit as Mr. Ward has lots on his
mind,

inging The Infinite

Another critic called this music
“vital jazz.” I can’t disagree. It’s
all here—total recognition of each
instrument’s possibilities, and in
a combination hard to find these
days, musicians whose abilities
match that recognition.

As “Fat And Spoiled”

fans at W&L
and _ spoiled.
two very successful sea-
sons the students here expect
every game to be an easy win.
They don’t realize the ability of
our opponents.” Needless to say,
Coach Jack Emmer has been a
bit perturbed by the apparent stu-

“T believe the
have become fat

After

dent reaction to his lacrosse
team’s recent trip up North.
“People should realize that our

schedule consists of many other
tough opponents besides U.Va.,
including 4 in the Top 10, plus
the two top club teams.”

Coach Emmer’s club took preci-
little experience into the
Hero's Tourney, Their season was
still very young, and the tourna-
ment ineluded eight of the top
teams in the nation, The Wahoos
upset Maryland in the final, and
W&L grabbed third by defeating
the Carling Lacrosse Club. The
Generals had edged Cornell in
the opening round, and then been
overwhelmed by Maryland in the
semi-finals. On whole, the Blue
quitted themselves well against
the nation’s top ranked clubs.
John Hopkins, Navy, and Army
were among the top clubs not
participating.

OuUS

Over spring break, the Generals
demolished Roanoke College, 16-
G6. John Lalley led the Blue with
three goals and one assist. The
contest was played in the mud
and rain at Roanoke. W&L man-
aged to put the game away early,
Coach Emmer substituted
freely in the second half.

After the trip down the Valley,

and

Coach Kmmer’s crew headed on
their rather controversial North-
ern march, This campaign in-

cluded battles with Princeton, C.
W. Post, and Towson State. W&L

won the Prineeton game in over-
time by a score of 11-10. The rea-
son for the closeness of the con-
test was twofold: Princeton has

a good, solid club who was “sky-
high” for this particular game,
and the Generals did not play up
to their potential. The Tigers, as
the rest of the

teams in the Ivy League, have a
vendetta going on with Wash-
ington and Lee. They are upset
that W&L got invited to the
Tournament last year. They also
dislike the thought that we just

might play better lacrosse than
they. Those who attended the
Yale scrimmage could see the

“psych” potential in that club.
Ivies just love to beat W&L.

The Princeton game was played
on a cold and windy day. It was
a see-saw contest, with both clubs
grabbing the lead and then losing
it. Princeton lead by one going
into the last minute of regula-
tion. Skip Lichtfuss scored with
0:50 to go, to send the game into
overtime. Teddy Bauer scored the
winning goal, to give him a game
total of 3 goals and 2 assists.
Coach Emmer commented that
Skeet Chadwick had a good game
in the goal for the Generals.

Next, the Blue traveled to C.W.
Post, a Long Island school. La-
crosse is big in this area, and the
Generals expected quite a con-
test. But the W&L defense rose
to the occasion. Hastings played
in the goal in the second half.
Dave Warfield scored four and
had one assist.

To close out the trip, the Gen-
erals took on Towson State, the
nation’s 9th ranked team. A con-
ference game, Coach Emmer call-
ed this one of the most important
of the tour. In now typical fash-
ion, the Blue allowed Towson to
open up a 2 goal lead. After trail-
ing 6-3 at the quarter, they man-
aged to tie it up at 7 apiece by
halftime. The first half saw W&L
having troubles controlling the
face-offs. But the second half
saw Chip Tompkins take over
early, and control this depart-
ment for the Blue, They grabbed
a two goal lead, and then lost it.
With the game knotted at 10
apiece, Chasney scored with 0:58
to go. Eight seconds later, a
Towson defenseman scored to tie
it up again. Tompkins won the
subsequent face-off. The ball went
to Bauer, who scored unassisted
with 0:20 seconds in the ball

Baseball, Tennis, Track
Close Successful Tours

All of Washington and Lee’s
spring sports teams had success-
ful road trips during Spring Va-
cation.

The baseball team, bouncing
back from last year’s disastrous
spring trip, managed to win three
of six contests on the road. The
Blue opened up at Valdosta with
two games. The Generals started
off slowly, dropping both games,
0-7 and 1-2, The second game was
shortened due to rain, but the
contest was ruled official. In spite
of the losses, W&L played well.
Valdosta’s coach commented to
Coach Lyles after the two game

set, “You men have the best de-
fensive ball club we've seen so
far.”

Traveling to the Sunshine State,
the Generals opened a two game
stint with Eckerd College, alias
Florida Presbyterian. Eckerd car-
ried a 17-3 record into the series,
losing only to such clubs as North
Carolina, Harvard, and Riter.
Eckerd won their eleventh
straight when they defeated the
Blue 2-0 in the first game. But
the Generals rallied behind fire-
balling Rod Ferrandino to grab
a 3-1 victory and break the home
club’s streak.

The “Diamond Nine” finally
began to live up to Coach Lyles
high expectations. They swept
two from Florida Tech by scores
of 7-2 and 10-2. Jeff Knauer and
Ellie Gutshall had the mound
chores. The pitching was excel-
lent, the hitting came around, and
the Generals “wheels” swiped 21
bases in the two games.

The Generals returned to Lex-
ington with a respectable 3-5
record, much better at this point

than last year’s championship
club. More importantly, they re-
turn riding a big three game win
streak, a win streak built on some
tough teams. The momentum
should be three for today’s con-
test with Oneonta State. Follow-
ing the 3:00 encounter at home,
the Blue tangle with Madison on
Thursday and Hampden-Sydney
on Saturday, both at home.
Things are still looking up for
the Lyles club. Some players
have been moved around, and the
line-up have been juggled, but
there is still a good attitude with
the players. As Co-Captain Ellie

Gutshall and third sacker Don
Hathway both quipped. “From
here on out, we're gonna be

tough.”

Coach Tom Davies’ tennis team
had an even more successful
Southern tour, After losing to a
strong South Carolina squad, 9-0,

Freshman Mike Burns’ and
Junior Doug MecNeel led the W&L
contingent in Monday’s Boston

Marathon. In the process, Burns
set a W&L marathon record,
breaking the one that he had

set in the Duraleigh marathon.
He ran the 26 mile, 385 yard
course in 2 hours, 57 minutes and
21 seconds, cutting 43 seconds off
his previous best, In the process,
Burns finished a close 213th be-
hind winner Jon Anderson of
Eugene, Oregon, who crossed the
finished line and dove into the
shower in front of the Prudential
Building in 2 hours, 16 minutes,
and 3 seconds. McNeel finished
a respectable 466th.

Both students were pleased
with their performances, and
Burns’ only comment immediately
following the race was “I can’t
believe I ran the whole thing.”

The race began in the smali
town of Hopkinton, and ended in
downtown Boston, The course ran
mostly through residential areas,
and a little bit of the Massa-
chusetts countryside.

The most outstanding side of
the race was the mammoth spec-
tator participation. Crowds lined
the course, many offering the
passing runners refreshments—
ice water, gator ade, and orange

showers or wet sponges, anything
to cool them off in the 73 degree
weather. Many of the participants
went home with heat strokes, ana
other assorted ailments. But our
W&L men came home safe «and

sound,

Among the many spectators lin-
ing the corridor were a_ large
group of Wellesley girls, whom
the W&L runners said “compare
very favorably to those at Hol-
lins. All in all it was exceptional
race for the Blue harriers, Finish-
ing was in itself an accomplish-
ment. But for both to be in the
top 40 per cent of the 1,384
participants was simply amazing.

students if they were convicted.

A similar situation currently
exists at Charlottesville, where
four University of Virginia stu-
dents were among 22 arrested in
a drug bust March 26 and 27.

According to the Cavalier Daily,
U.Va.’s newspaper, that school’s
administration is refraining from
any action on the cases for the
time being. The newspaper quoted
Associate Dean of Students An-
nette Gibbs as saying, “We can't

do anything now because this is
all alleged. We have not gotten
in touch with the authorities to
see what action will be taken. It
would not be fair to the students
or to anyone else.”

Hummer is the first W&L stu-
dent arrested in last November’s
bust to go to trial. Two more will
be tried next week in Rockbridge
Circuit Court. Seniors Douglas
Bruell of Cleveland Heights, Ohio,
and Kevin Darby of Huntington,
N.Y., will be tried April 26.
