New EC Move

Student Activities

TONIGHT—Clear, low in mid 50's,
TOMORROW — Partly cloudy,

high in low 80's.

Sweeping new changes involy-
ing the current University Center
Committee have been initiated
for next year by the incoming

1973-74 Executive Committee,
The restructuring of the Uni-
versity Committee into a Stu-

dent Activities Board was brought
about primarily to prevent dup-
lications of activities and func-
tions by different extracurricular
activity groups, such as the two
film programs now run by the
EC Film Committee and the Uni-
versity Center Committee.

The restructuring involves the
naming of a chairman to head the
entire Student Activities Board
and four sub-chairmen to head

four subcommittees.

A prime function of the new
committee will be to coordinate
scheduling of all activities on
campus, not only to prevent dup-
lication, but also to spread out
activities in a balanced manner
over the entire school year.

All campus organizations will
have to notify the Student Activi-
ties Board of any planned activi-
ties to prevent conflicts and dup-
lications.

The Film Subcommittee will
combine the present EC Film and
University Center Committees to
present a balanced scheduling of
films throughout the year.

The University Center Building

the board’s

Subcommittee would be in charge
of all organized activity in the
building.

The Recreation /Entertainment
Subcommittee would plan and
possibly financially support acti-
vities ranging from combo parties
to square dances to other enter-
tainment. The subcommittee will
be separate from the Dance
Board.

The Culture Subcommittee
would arrange fine arts and other
cultural programs, including
drama presentations, panel dis-
cussions, and programs similar to
“Wednesday Forum” initiated
this year.

The committee and subcommit-

tee chairmen will meet weekly,
according to the resolution passed
10-0 by the new EC. They will be
responsible for scheduling of all
events, including Contact and
Dance Board concerts.

The new EC formulated the re-
structuring in cooperation with
Ken Lane, director of the Univer-
sity Center.

Petitions for chairman and sub
chairmen positions on the new
Student Activities Board are due
Monday, May 14, at 6 p.m. in the
EC mailbox in the University
Center. The new EC said applica-
tions should include the position
applied for and the _ telephone
number of the applicant.

OUTLOOK andREVIEW| 73-74 President-Elect Schwartz
Talks On Drugs, Honor System

Does the Faculty Respect Us?

The University Council met last Thursday afternoon in
a truly remarkable session, For the first time since the creation
of the joint student-faculty body a few years ago, the Council
voted right down the middle on an issue—all the faculty mem-
bers voting in a block against all the student members. Never
before has there been a question placed before the Council
which catalyzed such a clean-cut disagreement between the
Teachers and the Taught.

With two student members missing and with the academic
deans adding to the majority, the faculty won the day and the
plan was defeated,

The proposal which prompted this historic occasion was,
admittedly, a controversial one from the start. The new EC,
headed by Student Body President-Elect Doug Schwartz, pre-
sented a plan to alter the make-up of the Courses and Degrees
Committee. It called for increasing student representation on
the committee from one to six, and making it a parity body
with six counterpart faculty representatives. The proposal, in
addition, carried an informal endorsement from the present
Executive Committee.

The students who presented the plan, headed by Schwartz
and Lewis Powell, anticipated the faculty reaction exactly.
This would be one more student incursion into faculty do-
mains, one more incremental relinquishment of faculty power
in university policy.

And that is precisely how most of the faculty members on
the Council reacted to the plan. English professor John Evans,
who picked up the banner for the faculty side, wondered im-
mediately why such changes in the power structure always
occurred in favor of the students and at the expense of the
faculty. If the EC was really interested in the sharing of
power between students and faculty, he asked, why haven't the
students invited faculty members to join in the administration
of the honor system?

The point was clear: the Trustees of Washington and Lee
have expressly entrusted the Honor System to the students ;
and likewise, they have entrusted the faculty with responsibil-
ity for the curriculum and the academic realm.

One can understand the faculty’s reluctance, therefore, to
yield power in this area. But when examined more carefully,
the EC’s proposal would not actually upset this “separation of
powers” as intended by the Trustees—rather, it would trans-
late into more student input and influence, (not power) in
determining and molding their curriculum,

Schwartz and Powell kept re-emphasizing this distinction
in their argument for the C&D plan. The faculty, they said,
would retain full control over the granting of degrees; there
would be no student say-so in this realm at all. Furthermore,
the faculty at large would reserve the right to reject any re-
commendation made by C&D.

So what the students were asking was this: a more direct
channel into decision-making in matters of rules and course
content. And this is where the analogy between the Courses
and Degrees Committee and the Honor System is solely in
student hands, presumably because only students, not faculty
members, are tried under its jurisdiction. On the other hand,
every student is inevitably affected by the courses he takes,
any many students make the claim (quite justly) that their
point of view concerning courses can and should be as con-
structive as their professor's.

Now whether or not all this demands parity representation
on C&D is another matter. But one thing is clear: most stu-
dents do not feel that their opinions and ideas are being listen-
ed to and considered with the attention they deserve.

Does the faculty actually respect what a student has to say
concerning the academic aspects of university life? The meet-
ing on Thursday focused on this crucial question when Dr.
Cc. W. Barritt asked, “What harm would it do to have six
students sitting on C&D?" The best answer that could be
wiven was that C&D recommendations would no longer be
considered with as much weight by the faculty. Or, in other
words, respect for the committee would be undermined merely
by the addition of student members.

~ Now this attitude on the part of the faculty may be, in
fact, largely justified, Surely, the responsibility for correcting
this mistrust lies as much with the students as with the fac-
ulty. As is the case so often, student performance working with
C&D so far has not been particularly stellar, And, according to
several C&D faculty members, the Curriculum committee,
whose frustrations provided the impetus for the EC plan,
failed all year long to think out their proposals and to present
them authoritatively.

But no matter how this dilemma is specifically resolved,
something has got to be done soon. The faculty has to show
that it has confidence in the maturity and judgment of the
W&L students. And the students, whatever position of re-
sponsibility they hold, must make every effort to show them-
selves worthy of that confidence.

This is the first of two articles drawn
from a recent interview with Doug Sch-
wartz, second year law student and presi-
dent-elect of the W&L student body, This
week's article airs some of Schwartz's views
on the honor system and on the situation
involving the W&L students who were ar-
rested in a drug bust last November, Next
week, Schwartz discusses the Phi, coeduca-
tion, the EC, and the lack of community on
the W&L campus.—Ed.,

What do you think are the basic problems
with the Honor System at W&L?

I guess what it gets right down to is a
very simple problem with our honor sys-
tem as it is today. It does not work, and
for a simple reason. You are putting stu-
dents in a position of finding a person guilty
and kicking him out of school forever, or
finding him innocent and taking no action.
The EC has a tremendous problem kicking
anyone out of school to begin with. There
has to be fairly extreme circumstances and
a fairly extreme clear cut case for the EC
to vote to kick somebody out.

Once they do this then that person would
be crazy not to go to a public honor trial
where it is nearly impossible to get a public
jury to kick anyone out short of something
extremely serious, more than just plagiar-
ism or stealing chairs. This is mainly be-
cause with many of the people I talked to,
they will not kick someone out for one mis-
take which will affect the rest of their lives.
It is too harsh a penalty in most circum-
stances. I agree that many times a person
has done something wrong and deserves to
be punished, but when the only punishment
is expulsion, to take action is untenable.
So what’s the good of having only this ex-
treme penalty, if it will never be used. The
faculty is probably losing faith in the stu-
dent’s ability to run an honor system.

What do you propose in lieu of the pres-
ent system?

The EC will vote for guilt or innocence,
the same way they did before. Once they
establish guilt then they vote, based on
equity where the punishment will fit the
crime, whether the person deserves expul-
sion or suspension for one year, It’s a very
minor reform, and the result of it would be
to make the honor system enforceable. Stu-
dents will turn other students in and there
will be convictions when need be.

In reference to the recent drug busts on
campus, what do you feel the school’s role
should be in relation to the accused and
convicted students?

These students are in the position they
are in because of their sheer bad luck. I
wouldn't hesitate to estimate that at least
80% of the student body at W&L uses or
has used marijuana. Then for any student

organization, such as the SCC, to sit back
on its high haunches and say, “well, he’s
guilty, he should be kicked out of school,”
is to me just bullshit. No action should be
taken, The university should be doing every-
thing they can to protect these students.
These students will no doubt be severely
hurt by these charges, and there is no
earthly reason for the university to punish
them further by withholding their degrees.

These guys are going to suffer for the
rest of their lives for doing things that in
our generation is not at all criminal in our
minds. Although the law is still behind the
times. Probably within three years the laws
will be changed. Seven of these men are

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

going to be graduating. They've fulfilled
their course requirements and have done
well and there is no reason for the univer-
sity to turn around and say “you've been
convicted of a felony, we don’t want you to
have a W&L diploma.” There are many
people who have done far worse things than
this. And if they do anything to the stu-
dents involved in the drug bust, then they
should recall all diplomas from anyone who
has ever been involved in a crime. Therefore
I think that the University should do noth-
ing academically against these students.

How would you suggest that W&L han.
dle these types of cases?

Since in the past there has been no ex-
plicit policy on how to handle a case such as
this what the university has to do first is
develop a policy and then put in into effect.
They cannot ex post facto put it into effect
upon these accused students. The university
can hardly condone the use of drugs, but
the university should not condemn the use
of drugs. The use of drugs is too widespread
and too pervasive for them possibly to say,
“we condemn the use of drugs, we're going
to kick out anybody who uses them.”

The use of drugs at W&L is widespread,
however these men have been indicted on
selling of drugs. Isn’t it incumbent on the
school to take some action, for it cannot
even tacitly condone the sale of drugs?

First of all, Sisler was unable to prove in
any way selling of drugs, All he was able to
establish was accommodation of drugs, and
in Virginia law there is a distinction be-
tween possession, accommodation and sell-
ing of drugs. These men did not go out and
solicit the sale of drugs. They accommodat-
ed friends. Two undercover agents became
close friends of these students. They smoked
dope with these students, drank beer, shar-
ed their dinner, their wine, shared their
homes and hearth with these students as
good friends, then turned around and asked
them for dope, asked them for marijuana
or hashish, and in one case mescaline. These
students did not go out in the streets and
say, “we want to sell you this.” There was
no profit made.

Also, I think these undercover agents
were allowed to smoke marijuana. Here
they are breaking a law, and then turning
people in for breaking that same law. The
only way they caught these students was
by breaking the law. I think that’s pretty
damned disgusting. Therefore I don’t feel
the university should condone this form of
arrest by taking any sort of action against
these students. Furthermore, the honor sys-
tem covers lying, cheating and stealing, and
these men infracted on none of these rules,
which is, ineidently why they were not
brought in front of the EC.

The W&L Honor System... Is It
Out of Step With Changing Times?

Tim Kearney submitted this ar-

vour fellow

students not to lie, hooks from the

bookstore and all faith in itself to enforce the

ticle to raise some serious ques-
tions about the current W&L
Honor System. His views do not
necessarily reflect those of the
Ring-tum Phi.—lEd.

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s Honor System is based on
mutual trust between students.
It states that they shall not lie,
cheat or steal, implying that stu-
dents have faith in other students
to live according to this code.
Someone long ago chose the era-
dication of lying, cheating and
stealing as having moral and /or
practical value for our academic
community, Why did he choose
these three standards? Why not
choose to discourage breaking
drug laws, statutory rape, and
speeding? Obviously the former
pertained more to the University
than did the latter when the
Honor System was drafted in the
nineteenth century, Are these
three behavioral guides still per-
tinent today? De we have faith
in our fellow students today to
refrain from lying, cheating and
stealing?

The drafter of the Honor Sys
tem made it one’s duty to expose
known violations of the Honor
System. In a sense we became our
brother's keeper. To benefit from
the freedom of this Honor Sys
tem one must seek faith in the
system, in essence one has to
trust his fellow students. Faith
comes from knowledge, Statisti-
cal knowledge or intuitive knowl-
edge that your faith will show
vou we're right, creates strength
and use of a system, If the facts
(knowledge) betray your trust
and faith, then your faith will be
haken each time your trust fails
vou. Again, do you have faith in

cheat, or steal?

What is the function of the
Honor System? Is it to create fair-
ness academically so grading will
be a truer measure of achieve-
ment? Is it to provide function
for the university's Executive
Committee? Is it to create com-
munity trust in us students so
that the Lexington merchants
will cash our checks? Is it to
make our university more severe,
somehow more prestigious, to a
society that might value such
honor and trust? Whatever the
function of the Honor System, is
it meaningful to our student life
today?

Today our Honor Systematized
student life includes institutiona-
lized violations of this Honor Sys-
tem. What do you (we) do when
students from athletic teams keep
equipment and clothing long af-
ter they have stopped playing
for a schoo! team, when students
falsify their age to buy alcohol,
when students “souvenir” roads
signs and other public and com
mercial property with which to
decorate thelr rooms, and when
students say they'll do something
and then don’t without regard to
your expectation? We accept it.
This acceptance subtiy honors
these actions. We have created a
society that has institutionalized
petty theft and general dishonesty,
a society that must statutorily
expell some poor sucker who gets
caught Iving about some wood he
took from a burned barn that has
been abandoned, What do we do,
when students fall to return
books to the university center and
MeCormick libraries, when stu
dent workers take free meals
from the Cockpit when not work

ig there and when students take

textbook supply? We do nothing.
| dare say that some of the above
“new traditions” we would like
to keep. I think these violations
are rampant today and that we
all know about them, or commit
them ourselves. I think our be-
havior clashes with our image of
the Honor System.

I think the Honor System is
outof-step with our times. It de-
mands friends to squeal on friends
for petty theft when the student
community has sanctioned petty
theft by institutionalizing it. The
people who drew up the Honor
System obviously wanted it. His-
tory tells us that student bodies
of the past have lived by it. To-
day students’ acions plainly indi-
eate that they don't want the
Honor System in its present form
and punishment. Today's behav-
ior significantly shows that stu
dents do not want to police the
actions of their classmates, es-
pecially when it can result in the
classmate’s expulsion,

Why doesn't anyone change
the Honor System then? Because
they don't have te. Nobody today
turns anyone in, At this point, |
acknowledge those few suckers
who got caught and who are the
irony of our Honor Systemitized
<tudent community,

| think lying, cheating, and
stealing are still practical things
to discourage in our community
I think the present Honor Sys
tem faile miserably to do so, |
suggest that the Honor System by
its severe punishment is unbal
anced, The punishment outweighs
ninety-nine per cent of the vio
lations and more importantly that
it ia the direct cause of many vio
being

ition nevet exposed |

think oul tLudent badly has lost

code it imagines it still lives by.

Perhaps next September we
should write an Honor Code that
we will fee! obliged to uphold and
participate in, After a hundred
years perhaps we should vote to
see if the student body wants an
Honor System.

This article necessarily lacks
details and statistics, it is rather
general in its comments, due to
the irony that the Honor System
is so structured as to not allow
a factual study of its effective-
ness. Please think about the ques-
tions posed and maybe write your
Executive Committee member. |
suggest, for those interested, to
ask professor Leach about the
number of stolen books in recent
years from the library. Also, to
consult the cold check committee
about the recent deluge of bounce-
ed checks, or to ask the athletic
department about the number of
missing supplies, would yield in
teresting statistics, Ask anyone in
the Cockpit for a free meal,

Baseball Team Still

Baseball is a strange game, and
playing it at W&L this season has
proved no exception. The Gen-

spectable Southern tour, and have
since been struggling to maintain
a .500 record, Yet all is not lost.
It was revealed Monday that the
fourth and final NCAA playoff
berth is up for grabs between
W&L, Madison and Morehead,

The sole roadblock for the Gen-

Ruggers to Face
WEM May 12

The W&L ruggers will finish up
their season May 12 at William
and Mary. The team will be going
into the game cold, playing its
last game two weekends ago.

The squad split two contests
that weekend, dumping Duke on
Saturday, 9-4, and losing to the
University of Tennessee Sunday,
13-6.

The Tennessee game marked
the initiation of the Confederate
Cup, a trophy which will be
fought for between the two
squads twice each year—once in
the spring and once in the fall.
W&L led the Tennessee squad at
the half, 6-0, on a tally by Jeff
Davies and conversion by John
Markley, but the Volunteers came
back on two penalty goals to tie
the score at 6-6, Tennessee con-
tinued its second-half surge to
clinch the victory.

Prime consolation for the W&L
ruggers after the loss was that a
General was the only one capable
of chugging a Confederate Cup-
ful of brew.

crals lies in one weekend of base-
ball, which will include the CAC
championships, and a make-up
doubleheader with Apprentice on
Sunday. Should the Generals
sweep the contests, the berth
should come our way. W&L’s rec-
ord would be identical to Madi-
son's, with the Blue having play-
ed a much stiffer schedule.

W&L has the potential to go
all the way. According to Coach
Lyles, “It takes three strong start-
ing pitchers to win the CAC and
we, already being defending
champs, have the pitchers to
carry us through the hectic CAC
schedule into Sunday’s double-
header.” The Generals will rely
on the arms of Rod Ferrandino,
Jeff Knauer and Haller Jackson,
and the sticks of Don Hathway
(.367), Jeff Knauer (.296), and
the long ball hitting of Ellie Gut-
shall,

The Biue currently stand at
7-9, including losses in the 11th,
13th, and 14th innings. The Gen-
erals recently swept a double-
header from Old Dominion, the
team which kept them out of the
playoffs last season. This past
Friday they split with Bridgewat-
er by tallies of 1-2, 6-2, with Jack-
son picking up the win in the late
game, Monday, the club dropped
an 8-3 decision to VMI.

While scraping its nose to get
above .500, just like last vear, the
ball club finds itself in position
for playoffs. Coach Lyles says,
“This has been a good team yet

they have received no recogni-
tion. It’s discouraging.”
The CAC championships will

be played Thursday, Friday, and
Saturday afternoons up on the
baseball! field. Other teams in the
tourney are Sewanee, Centre, and
Southwestern,

CAC Festival
Slated Here

Washington and Lee University
will defend its College Athletic
Conference championship _ this
weekend when it hosts the CAC
Spring Sports Festival.

CAC members W&L, Centre,
Sewanee and Southwestern
(Tenn.) will compete in four

spring sports: baseball, golf, tenn-
is and track, They are vieing for
the President’s Trophy, a 300-
pound locomotive bell symbolic
of the overall conference cham-
pionship.

After competition in two fall
sports (football and cross-coun-
try) and three winter sports (bas-
ketball, swimming and wrestling),
Washington and Lee has a slim
lead over Sewanee, 85 points to
75, Centre is a close third with
60, While Southwestern — trails
with 25.

W&L's toughest competition is
expected to come from Sewanee,
whcih is always strong in the
spring sports, Southwestern is the
team to beat in track, while Cen-
tre will be tough in tennis and
baseball.

The W&L Tennis squad is
carrying an 1-2-7 record with two
more matches’ scheduled this
week, one with Hampden-Syd-
ney and the other with Emory
and Henry. The Blue netters will
go into this competition with one
championship under their belts—
the VCAA’s,

Washington and Lee captured
championships in tennis, golf, and
baseball last year to wrap up the
overall title. Sewanee should give
the Generals a run for their
money in all three sports. Base-
ball, a round-robin affair, is a
toss-up among the four teams.

Southwestern will bring a stable
full of speedsters to defend its
track championship, The Lynx
currently hold nine conference
records, and three of the record-
holders will return to perform on
W&L's Wilson Field track Friday
and Saturday; Herman Morris,
John Keesee, and hurdler Ralph
Allen.

LEXINGTON GOLF COURSE—

The Lexington Golf Course is
an interesting little place where
one can sharpen certain aspects of
one’s game. If you can chip and
putt well, Lexington is the place
to go to lower the old average. It
is a relatively short (par 71)
course where a good drive leaves
you only a wedge or short iron
from the green on many of the
par 4's,

The greens are undoubtedly
the course's outstanding feature
with traps and bunkers coming
in a close second, For four dollars
you can play all day (with the
price going up to five dollars on
weekends and holidays). Because
of rain, I was only able to play
the back nine, but I think it is
the most interesting of the two.
Here is a hole-by-hole description
with each hole’s outstanding
points being stressed.

No, 10—This 394 yard par 4 has
you teeing off over a pond with
the green being set back slightly
to the right. Nothing spectacular,
a small creek in front of the
green is the only other hazard.

No. 1l—This par 5, 510 yard
hole can get you in real trouble
It doglegs sharply to the left
about 150 yards out so use an bron
off the tee unless you play a dri-
ver way to the left, The latter is
not recommended because the

fairway slopes sharply and be-
cause the grass is sparse, the
ground is very hard, making it

tough for the ball to hold.

W&L, U.Va.-The Game

 

By PAUL CAVALIERE

Washington and Lee's sixth
ranked Generals rolled over two
more opponents this week to
bring their record to 11-0, They
beat previously undefeated Frank-
lin and Marshall, 21-5, and trounc-
ed Baltimore University 16-7.

In both games the Generals
came out firing and scored almost
at will in the first quarter, and
then coasted home to victory.
They were unable to score in this
fashion a the outset of the season,
and this led to their trailing early
in many of their contests. Coach
Emmer now hopes that the team
can put its confidence and its
stickwork together to beat the
University of Virginia on Wilson
Field Sunday.

“The U.Va. game could well be
the biggest game W&L lacrosse
has ever played,” said Coach Em-

No .12—You can cut this dogleg
par 4 with a real good drive, but
the fairway is the worst on the
back nine. It is 388 yards from
the white tees with the fairway
poorly defined and the grass de-
pleted by heavy erosion.

No. 13—This is definitely not
an unlucky hole. Measuring only
301 yards, it really plays shorter.
Uniess you duckhook your drive
it is virtually impossible to get
into trouble. The green is easy
to read (as are most of the
course's) and in top shape, One
disadvantage is that they have
not gone to the trouble to put
fringes on the greens.

No, 14—This is a short 132 yard
par 3 with a gently sloping green.
No real trouble, The traps on this
hole typify those on the rest of
the course. Well trimmed on the
edges, you will never find clumps
of grass growing in the traps
themselves. They are well drain-
ed and are filled with fine white
fluffy sand.

No. 15—This is a short par 4,
only 348 vards from tee to green
Only trouble Is the white stakes
on the right for you slicers and a
big bunker on the left for you
hookers

No, 16-—Another real short pat
i (this one only 338 yards) it can
be trouble, There are woods on
the right and the finger of a lake
that extends nearly
fairway about 235 yards out. A
good drive and you could be in
It is a lot safer to tee off with a

across the

mer. No W&L team has ever been
undefeated going into the final
game of the regular season. Cur-
rently the Generals are 11-0. Even
though the Blue are ranked sixth
and playing on their home field,
they still will be the underdogs.
Coach Emmer hopes that the
entire student body will come out
and support its team. It will most
likely be reminiscent of last year’s
affair—a high scoring contest.
Momentum will be essential.

rounding these three (3) cases, it
was decided that they should be
handled as the exception rather
than as the rule. Among the ex-
tenuating circumstances consider-
ed were the following:”

1) There are 9 cases involving
graduating seniors. At this point,
only 3 will appear before the SCC
because we do not feel we can
justify a hearing until after the
evidence is presented in civil
court and 6 of the 9 cases will not
be heard until after graduation
this year, We feel that, due to the
close relationship of all of these
cases, severe action taken against
only 3 of the 9 would be grossly
unjustified.

2) Although the 3 individuals
we considered are at this point
convicted felons, it should be re-
cognized that there are degrees
of criminality. The accommodat-
ing nature of sales to friends in
these cases must be considered as
opposed to an active, profitable,
“pushing” of drugs to non-stu-
dents and minors.

3) It is felt that the actions of

these students should in no way
be taken lightly, but especially in
light of the above point these stu-
dents have already received
enough penalty, They are now
convicted felons (with all the
ramifications this will carry in
later life), they may very well
spend time in the penitentiary,
they have been and will be placed
under a heavy financial burden,
and finally the pressure under
which they have been placed has
affected them academically.

1) Severe penalty appearing in
their pre-sentence reports might
have an adverse effect on sen-
tencing.

5) There was no_ widespread
understanding among the student
body that the University would
feel the need to take action were
cases such as these brought to
light.

“The recommendation the Stu-
dent Control Committee made to
the Student Affairs Committee
(i.e, that no further action be
taken) should not be taken as an
apathetic stance, There are cases

four wood and take a little longer
chip to the green. The hole dog-
legs left, don’t make the mistake
of playing to the 17th green which
is the only one you can see from
the tee.

No. 17—Another short par 3, it
is only 131 yards, but it is all
carry as you hit to a fairly large
par 3 green. This hole has the
worst tee on the back nine. You
only have 20 yards in back of the
green before you run into a
swamp so the tee shot leaves lit-
tle room for error,

No, 18—A truly majestic finish-
ing hole it is undoubtedly the
most scenic hole on the course.
It is a 488 yard par 5, The fair-
way goes down a long hill which
has a lake at the bottom of it,
about 450 yards from the tee. A
good drive will really carry, but
the rough on this hole (as it un-
fortunately is on the others also)
is allowed to grow apparently un-
checked, It is very easy to lose a
ball off the tee because you can’t
find it in the rough and the dan-
delions at this time of year make
it especially tough to pick a ball
out of the seemingly millions of
white blossoms that line the fair-
way. If you can finally get to the
green you are faced with one of
the most undulating greens I’ve
ever seen. If the pin placement is
right, a putt hit too strong may
stop rolling about 10 yards off the
green. All the greens are hard
and difficult to hold, but the 18th
