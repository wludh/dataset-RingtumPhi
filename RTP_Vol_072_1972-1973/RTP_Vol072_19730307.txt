The Symposium In Review

Gregory Winds

Arriving over two and a_ half
hours late for his scheduled 8:30
p.m. speech Monday, social critic
and comedian Dick Gregory none-
theless ended this year’s Contact
program with a bang.

Gregory's speech, ending about |
a.m. Tuesday morning two hours
after it had begun, drew a standing
ovation from the large audience in

Doremus. Most of the members of
the audience had come to hear
Gregory at 8:30 p.m., left when it
was announced that he would be
delayed because of transportation
problems, and returned two hours
later, waiting another half hour be-
fore Gregory finally reached Lex-
ington,

Gregory's speech was actually the

W&L Theatre Presents
‘Thieves Carnival’ Farce

CHRISTOVICH

Jean Anouilh’s farcical comedy,
“Thieves Carnival,” will be pre-
sented by the Washington and Lee
University Theatre March 20-24, in
the university's theatre.

By MICHAEL

The play is in almost direct con-
trast to earlier productions of the
University Theatre this year, “Troi-
lus and Cressida” and “Streetcar
Named Desire,” according to the
director of the play Lee Kahn.

While few can see any compari-
sons between the dramatic works
of William Shakespeare and
Anouilh, there was particular care
taken in the arrangement of the
three plays for this season's Uni-
versity Theatre productions. Follow-
ing two highly intense dramatic
productions, Anouilh’s “Thieves
Carnival” allows both director Kahn
and the WAL viewing audience a
break from seriousness to high level
comedy

Unlike many of Anouilh’s other
works, “Thieves Carnival” does not
possess an underlying social theme,
but only portrays farcical comedy
at a steady level. Anouilh, who
usually is affiliated with the Theatre
of the Absurd has partially for

New Contenders Enter

Lewis Powell is no longer unop-
posed in his bid for presidency of
the student body, as three other
W&L students took advantage of
a one-week delay in elections to
announce their candidacies for the
post.

Juniors Averill Harkey and Harry
Smith and intermediate law student
Doug Schwartz have filed petitions
for the presidential post. Last week
at this time, Powell, a junior, was
running without opposition.

The voting was delayed one week
due to a clause in the student body
consitution stated that “General
elections for the Big Five Positions
shall be held on the Monday of the
tenth week” of the Winter Term
This past week was only the ninth
of the semester.

Campaign speeches by candi-
dates for student body offices
will be given Thursday at 7
p.m. in Evan’s Dining Hall,

Junior Richard Jones is still run-
ning unopposed for Fancy Dress
president, but previously unopposed
sophomore candidate T. Barry Davis
now has to oppose freshman Bill
Sands for the post of vice-president
of the Dance Board.

The slate of candidates is un-
changed for vice-president of the
student body, with juniors Mike
Brittin, Steve Greene, and Bill War-
burton in the battle.

One more candidate has been
added to the race for secretary of
the student body, bringing the total
number of candidates for that office
to five. Junior Everett Martin has
joined Paul Cavaliere, Bob Keatley,
Dave Rigby, and Ben Sherman in
the race.

The Executive Committee Mon-
day noted that all students except
exchange students would be eligible
to vote in Monday's election,

The hotly debated coeducation
referendum came into some hot de-
bate for a reason other than the
coed issue itself Monday at the EC
meeting. Vice-president Bill Merrill
made a motion to allow only the
undergraduate student body to vote
on the referendum.

Merrill felt that since the law
school was already coed, it was not
really concerned with the coeduca-
tion issue. He also said the law
school would not be affected on
a classroom basis if the undergradu-
ate school went coeducational,

Law representative Jeff Twardy
took exception to this, stating “You
can't tell me that the law school
will not be affected by a potential
coeducational situation.” Several EC
members agreed, noting that the
law school is an important part of
the university as a whole, and that
it would be affected if the whole
school went coed,

Merrill's motion was defated in

Up Contact 73

next to last scheduled speech in this
year’s Contact program. However,
L. Patrick Gray, acting director of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
could not come to Lexington Tues-
day night due to hearings currently
being held regarding his appointment
to the post of director of the FBI
permanently.

Contact officials said they are try-
ing to reschedule Gray's appearance
for later this spring.

Three other speakers came to
Washington and Lee University this
past week, Last Wednesday, former
columnist Frank Mankiewicz spoke
on the “Government and the Press.”
Thursday, feminist Betty Friedan
spoke in Lee Chapel (see story on
page 3). James Dickey poet and
author of Deliverance, gave a read-
ing from his works Friday.

Most of Gregory's speech was
directed towards a variety of social
problems in this country, However,
a main theme of his speech cited
the role of college youth in America
for bringing the Vietnam War fin-
ally to a “winding down.” He did
not once mention that he considered
the war actually “ended” yet.

Gregory has been fasting for
nearly two years to protest the war.
During that time his weight dropped
from a high of over 280 pounds to
a low of, at one time, 98 pounds.
Gregory does not consume any
solids in his diet,

The social critic stressed the point
that he would remain fasting until
the war is over and all the prison-
ers on all sides were returned, Bul,
he added, once he goes off his
fasting, he would not do it again
“even if they were fighting in my
own house,”

Gregory ended his speech by call
ing for social change, but he also
added that violence is not the answer
io Aemrica’s social problems. If

violence were the answer, par-
ticularly for blacks, he noted, then
“a gun would be as hard to get
in the black ghetto as a good job.”

Mankiewicz anchored a “Free-
dom of Information” panel Wednes-
day afternoon as part of his dis-
cussion on the government and the
press, Also on the panel were Larry
Maisel, news director of WDBJ-TV
in Roanoke, Don Murray, former
news director, and Jay Denny, a
WA&L student,

Though the thrust of Mankie-
wicz's speech in Lee Chapel was
directed towards sharp criticism of
the state, he also leveled several
blasts at the press. For example,
he noted that the broadcast media
in the last election, because of time
limits, could only cover day to day
issues of the campaigns without cov-
ering the larger picture of the elec-
tions. He cited this as a prime rea-
son for MecGovern’'s sound defeat to
Nixon, as the press failed to discern
McGovern's “old-fashioned” cam-
paign from Nixon's “new style” of
campaigning, where he did almost
all of his campaigning without pub-
lic appearances or press conferences,

Another criticism leveled by Man-
kiewiez concerned the press’s exces-
sive reverence for the presidency.
The president, said Mankiewicz, has
been surrounded with pomp and
circumstance that “would embarass
the Grand Duchess of Lichtenstein.”

Dickey's speech was limited pri-
marily to readings from several of
his works, Earlier last Friday, how-
ever, in a discussion at the book-
store, Dickey did discuss the movie
Deliverance, based upon his novel,
He said the movie would have had a
good shot at winning an oscar for
“best picture” if The Godfather had
not received so much publicity,

In the case that no candidate gets

Lawyer, Businessman
Elected As Trustees

A prominent Houston attorney
and a North Carolina manufactur-
ing executive have been elected to
the board of trustees.

The election of Thomas D, And-
erson of Houston, a 1934 graduate,
and J. Alvin Philpott of Lexington,
N.C., a 1947 graduate, came at the
midwinter meeting of the board,
held last month in Atlanta.

Mr. Anderson is a partner in
Anderson, Brown, Orn & Pressler,
Houston law firm, and president of
Boston Co, of Texas, an invest-
ment counseling service. Mr. Phil-
pott is executive vice president of
Burlington House Furniture, a di-
vision of Burlington Industries, and
a director of the Southern Furni-
ture Manufacturers’ Association.

After graduation from Washing-
ton and Lee, Mr. Anderson joined
a Houston law firm, but in 1947
was named vice president of the
Texas National Bank. In 1956 he
became president of Texas Fund
Management Co., and later was
senior vice president and trust officer
of Texas Commerce Bank. He re-
turned to the practice of law in
1965,

He is a director and past presi-
dent of the Museum of Fine Arts
of Houston and the city’s Grand
Opera Association. He is also a
board member of the Episcopal
Church Foundation, the Episcopal
Diocese of Texas, and Lambuth
College, which awarded him an
honorary doctorate in 1967,

Mr. Philpott, a member of the
board of directors of W&L’s Alumni
Association since 1971, has been
associated with Burington House,
formerly United Furniture Co., since
graduation from W&L. He too is
extremely active in community
affairs, and has been chairman of
the city school board, hospital, Red
Cross, United Fund, Boy Scouts’
council, and Kiwanis Club,

One son, Benjamin G. Philpott,
is currently a junior at the uni-
versity. Mr. Philpott’s brother, Harry
M. Philpott, president of Auburn
University, is also a Washington and
Lee graduate.

Both men will join the board
formally when it meets here in May.
Their elections bring to 21 the num-
ber of trustees now serving. The
university's charter authorizes a
maximum of 22 trustees.

Commerce School Review
Launches Inaugural Issue

The Washington and Lee Com-
merce Review, a newly established
academic and professional journal,
has announced the publication of
its first issue.

The first two articles deal with
money, monetary theory and gov-
ernmental manipulation. The first,
“What Has Government Done to
Our Money?”, by Dr. Murray N.
Rothbard, Professor of Economics
at Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute,
is an application of the philosophical
alternative of the free market eco-
nomy to the production, distribu-
tion, and exchange of that familiar
commodity known as money. The
second article, “The Federal Re-
serve System: Pro and Con,” is a
differing viewpoint expressed by
WAL alumnus, Senator William
Brock of Tennessee. The third and
fourth articles deal with crises of
constitutional law, “The Attack on
the American Free Enterprise Sys-
tem,” is authored by the Honorable
Lewis FP. Powell, Jr., Associate Jus-
tice of the U.S, Supreme Court.

The Review's Sunday punch is the
previously unpublished conclusion to
Anthony Sutton’s three volume
study Western Technology and
Soviet Economic Development, 1917
to 1965, in which Sutton summarizes
the total dependency of the Soviet
economy upon Western technology
which has resulted from the in
ability of Soviet central planning to

i

serve as a Viable alternative cco-
nomic system,

The student founder and Editor-
in-Chief of the Review is William
G. K. Merrill, who is Vice-President
of the W&L student body, Treasurer
of the Commerce School Fraternity,
Assistant Head Dorm Counselor, a
Robert E. Lee Research Scholar,
a member of O.D.K. honor fra-
ternity and of Who's Who Among
Students in American Colleges and
Universities.

Merrill envisions the Review as
a means for the ongoing examina-
tion and debate of topics covered
in courses on business and eco-
nomics taught at this University, In
addition, the journal will be a
medium of communication between
students, faculty, businessmen and
government officials, Merrill hopes
to clarify a broad spectrum of
issues in economics and politics by
a “thorough analysis of the funda-
mental assumptions and premises
inherent in, but often overlooked
by, much contemporary dialogue.”
Above all the Review will allow
for the presentation of alternatives
in political and economic thought,
regardless of how fashionable those
alternatives may stand in the aca-
demic community.

The Review began to take shape
during the Summer of 1972, when
Merrill began soliciting contribu-

Yes On Coeducation
The

\nd if one can draw any conclusion from the student argu-

second annual coeducational referendum approaches,

ments which have been bandied about in anticipation of the
vote, it is this: no matter what side you're on, coeducation is
essentially an emotional issue.

Which is really too bad. For the prospect of coeducation
at Washington and Lee involves many intricate and difficult
problems which tend to get lost under the pro and con
rhetoric.

It is so easy, when debating the coed issue, to stereotype
one’s opposition. Many of the status quo advocates seem to
envision themselves standing firm against an onslaught of

of the pro-coed faction see their opposition as a male chau-

freaks looking for “relationships” instead of “dates.”
vinist fraternity block, fighting to preserve an outmoded
“down the road” lifestyle.

And it is these “gut” feelings to which most of the
rhetoric can be reduced,

In one sense, this dilemma is inescapable, since coeduca-
tion would mean a decided qualitiative change in Washington
and Lee social life. Whether or not the boy-girl “games” we
all play would be eliminated is uncertain; at least, the games
woud be different.

And so, for most of us voting in Monday's referendum,
our minds will be made up on the basis of how we as indi-
viduals have reacted to our experience at an all-male W&L
environment. If we have accepted the present “game” and
have played it well, chances are we'll be satisfied to see W&L
remain the same. If we have found this “game” to be frus-
trating and absurd, we'll most likely vote for some changes.

But in the interest of some kind of detachment, we would
like to review some of the arguments articulated by both the
anti-and pro-coeducation camps.

Three main objections keep arising out of any anti-co-
education argument:

(1) The cost would be much too great. Both sides agree
that introducing girls into the system here would mean
considerable expansion of facilities, both academic and social.
the
humanities and the fine arts. New dormitories would have to
be built.

(2) The necessary increase in enrollment would be unde-

There would most likely have to be a_ beefing-up of

sirable. W&L has always prided itself on the maintenance of
a good student-teacher ration and a small student body,

(3) Since we are now the oldest remaining all-male insti-
tution in the nation, we should remain that way—‘to provide
a choice” for men desiring such an environment. If the dis-
contented want girls around all the time (so the argument
runs), they should have gone elsewhere.

The pro-coeducation stance rests mainly on these points,

(1) W&L as an

environment for learning. Since the established trend is away

all-male institution is an “unnatural”
from strong fraternities and toward more varied lifestyles,
the university ought to adjust to that trend.

(2) The introduction of girls would be an educational plus,
both in the classroom and out. Furthermore, the requisite
strengthening of the arts and humanities would be, in them-
selves, a counter to an overemphasis on professional training.

(3) The enrollment increase called for by

The pro-coed camp has not been without its shrill voices.
When Betty Freidan came crusading for feminism here last
week, she exclaimed that precluding girls from W&L was
“unjust discrimination” —designed to prohibit women from
access to the power structure.

We do not subseribe to Mrs. Friedan’s nosy generaliza-
tions; nor do we feel that coeducation is a realistic prospect

because we feel it would best serve the future of W&L as an
institution,

Everyone who has come here, arrived aware of W&L's all-
tale status, that is true. But if a considerable segment of the
student body decided, after experiencing the all-male environ
ment, that they were dissatisfied, then a basic questioning of
the desirability of remaining all-male would be in order,

Coeducation should not be a campaign issue. Nor should
it take finaneial priority over a new library and other facets
of the present fund drive. But changes are oecuring at WAI

Good gracious, Martha, is nothing sacred? A foldout of Betty Friedan in

the Ring-tum Phil!!

Con

lo the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

Dr. Hodges and his allies in the
student body are once again in the
process of waging what has become
a perrennial crusade to bring down
this last great bastion of what they
might style “male chauvinism.”
Each year the same arguments are
paraded in hopes that this time,
perhaps, the opposition might just

stay in bed and not turn out to
vote against coeducaiton. Thank-
fully that has not yet happened.
WAL students have in the past

looked beyond the alluring but shal-
low benefits which coeducation
seems to offer and have voted down
the proposal whenever it has been
brought up before them.

The ultimate danger in coedtica-
tion is expansion, We are all familiar
with the lines in the introductory
section of the catalogue, “WAL is.
by choice, small.” and for many of
us. the factor of W&L's student
body size was an important draw-
ing card. There is an obvious ad-
vaniage derived from attending a
university where one's professor
knows him as a person rather than
as a number on an attendance sheet;
yet all of us know that the 11:1
student to faculty ratio trumpeted
about by the administration is con
tnually becoming more elusive than
ever, particularly when one is con-
fronted by the size of some of our
classes. Coeducation, with its ulti
mate menace in student body size,
would do anything but alleviate the
siitlation

What then, too, of housing? Co

education would require that new
dormitories be built to house the
imecoming women students. Never

mind the fact that there is a hous-
ing shortage here already for un
male students. If coeduca
tion is to come, women's residence
halls would have to take priority
over all other building projecis, in
cluding the new undergraduate
library and the renovation of old

No, the money to finance coeduca-
tion will not come from alumni
contributions. it will come from
tuition imereases, and large tuition
increases at that. The burden will be
on us. The financial burden will be
upon us, primarily,

I think we have to be pragmatic
when we look at coeducation. To
hide behind their arguments that an
all-male school is an “unreal” aca-
demic environment, and therefore
undesireable, is facetious as well as
a blatant attempt to ignore the hard,
cold implications of what coeduca-
tion will truly hold for W&L. At
such time as the faculty contains a
proportionate perceniage of hard
hats, cab drivers, farmers, mechan-
ics—and, oh yes, a fundamentalist
on one of the chairs of religion—
then we can sit down and talk
about the pro's and con's of “real”
and “ureal” academic environments.
Uniil then I trust that WAL students
will continue to look through this
haze of philosophical gymnastics,
and consider whal coeducation
means practically for themselves and
for the University’s future. Doing
so, | think most students will vote
no on coeducation next Monday

that it is fallacious to argue that
one receives an education solely in

being the case, how can anyone
seriously believe in full view of

black and no fully enrolled women
in the undergraduate student body.

Obviously, there are countervail-
ing opinions to the notion of going
coed. Maintaining the small size for
financial reasons and staying male
for traditional purposes seem to be
chef among them. I submit that the
former can be overcome with a
sense of purpose, and that the latier
argument is an argument from
emotion rather than reason. I took
strong exception to Lewis Powell's
statement printed in the Phi fast
when in addressing the Uni-
versity Committee, he said we had
a “duty” to the nation to provide
an all-male school of high academic
quality. Nonsense. Our duty is to
ourselves both as the student body
and as individuals. Our commitment
ought to be that we strive for
academic excellence as a small, lib-
university. Before con-
siructing new buildings we should
seek a more diversified student body.

Coeducation: Pros and Cons...

In conclusion, Ud have to say that
my experience at W&L has been
positive, all things considered. How-
ever, | would neither recommend
this school to my brother nor re-
cruit for it if asked, unless women
are admitted. This is but one man’s
opinion, but one that been to ail-
male schools and a coed one in his
education. The day has arrived to
“molt the skin” step into the real
world, improve the school, and
rightfully establish our position in
the upper stratum of American
higher education. Gentlemen, vote
yes for coeducation.

W hat’s Really Wrong withW@L...

A Country Club Superpoll

By J. JASON MATTHEWS

In response to a set of ques-
tionaires distributed to a random
selection of students, a sense of dis-
content has been ascertained in the
student body, The questionaire, pro-

fessionally compiled, dealt with
many facets of life here on the
W&L campus and what, if any-
thing, could be done to alleviate

those things which annoyed students.
Instead of using check marks or
short answer questions, we felt that
middle-length essays would not only
answer the question, but would give
us a sense of what the student is
fecling deep down in his heart.
For the most part, the essays were
lucid and well-written, destroying
in our estimation, the rumor that
10% of the student-graduates from
W&L leave unable to read or speak
at a fast pace.

Without a doubt, the thing that
irked most students was the pro-
vision for parking. Many felt a
“sense of dispair” while others ad-

mitted feeling like Teutencahmen
after the stone had been crowbared
into the “seal” position. One par-

ticularly distressing letter mentioned
the advent of “a day of reckon-
ing when the fools of the world
will be dealt with and shown no
mercy.” Specifics mention those
architectually aesthetic grass islands
which jut out and eliminate two
whole spaces as especially aggravat-
ing.

Next on the list is strangely
enough, the record store in the base-
ment of the Co-op. Many complain-
ed of “being driven crazy” by the
three-day take home trial system of
listening to The general
conensus is that to trust the students
so implicitly is an irritating dis-
play and that “stricter rules with
sign-up sheets and “penalty fines”
be instituted. One particularly dis-

records,

tressed student calls this practice
“an inhumane  reverse-psychology
technique only a madman would
use.”

tricky problem of
University-Lexington relations
figures is the next most common
grievance, namely the massive trac-
tor-trailers which roar up and down
Route 60 at all hours of the night.
Not only is the obvious noise fac-
tor disturbing but the danger repre-
sented by these monoliths of the
highway poses a real threat to stu-
dents. One such student swears that
he was pinned to the side of David-
for 2 minutes as first the
“advance green” trucks roared down

The obviously

son S

past him and then the “delayed
green” trucks scorched back up the
hill. One anonymous note claims
that the slipstream sucked a stu-

dent's Irish Setter under the wheels
of one of the “big-rigs” and smeared
it from the Post Office to the
Keydet-General before he could
make a move to rescue his hapless

pet,

Finally the last major complaint
which showed up as being a com-
mon source of annoyance was the
footbridge linking the Gym with
Wilson Field. Most complained that
they felt the bridge's anonymity was
undeserved,

“After all,” wrote one student,
“Don't we have the longest unsus-
pended footbridge in the world?”
Proposals to write to Travel maga-
zine or the National Geographic
were numerous, One inventive indi-
vidual suggested painting it in day-
glo paint so that “airplanes above
could look down and tell people
what it was.” Another distressingly
abrupt student advocated assasinat-
ing someone and telling the press
about the footbridge while being
interviewed for nation-wide  tele-
vision news,

While the list of grievenances now
becomes more _ individualistically
oriented, some interesting contri-
butions are visible, The short list
clarifies this point.

One student complained of the
Dopler Effect created by the walls
of the Quad which shatter his win-
dows, drinking glass, and Carmen
Miranda picture frame almost three
times a week.

One Psychology major expresses
extreme bitterness at the deliberate
electrocution of a white rat which
he had grown, “more than fond of.”
He claims others were “insanely
jealous of our happiness and tried
their best to make the few blissful

moments we had together miser-
able.”
A transfer student from Ran-

dolph-Macon complains that she 1s
being harrassed when she undresses
in front of her window at 135
Main Street every night between
11:00 and midnight by one or two
perverted Peeping Toms. (The win-
dow with the light pink curtains.)

An especially pious student gets
angry at those people who go to
church every Sunday but, “don't
really mean it.” He suggests a dunk-
ing stool be erected to test sin-
cerity; those “who sink are O.K.
but those who float should be burn-
ed in the Church's bar-b-que pit after
the service,”

Lastly, another transfer student
from Sweet Briar seems to feel that
there is an, “inordinate amount of
chauvinism and an atmosphere of
male superiority which always seems
to hinder the making of friends and
meeting of boys around campus.”
She is willing to share her spacious
apartment with any “liberal-minded
boy who is not hesitant to experi-
ment in inter-personal relations, who
does not look forward to any com-
mitments, and who does not  con-
demn todays ‘free morality’ as per-
verted or unnatural, but feels it is

rather, healthy and invigorating.”
She adds that, “the learning ex-
perience is so important that it

Tx TLL
DT Ad,

 

justifies risks too numerous to men-
tion.” If any boy is. Please contact
Joan Allenby at 463-0786,

With this, the list of student com-
plaining comes to a swift close, The
founding fathers of America in the
Declaration of Independence stated,
that every man has certain un-
alienable rights, Well I'm pretty sure
they meant students too, although
| know some people who would
give that argument a good run for
it's money. Each student, a highly
tuned instrument capable of absorb-
ing enormous amounts of complex
material for short periods of time,
cperates on a delicate balance. If
this balance is in any way disrupted,
Poof! there goes the student. Apo-
plexied extermities, rolling eyeballs,
flaking, scaling, and small crusty
patches on skin or scalp. I main-
tain that the University’s primary
function is to coddle the student,
with a soft layer of sdwathing
to surround his “baby intellect”
clothes. Believe me what I'm telling
you, | know! Goo-goo.

Short story-writer Barbara Deming seen above at a recent meeting with Fidel Castro, will be one of the
participants in a three day symposium begining today on “the woman of letters.” The symposium was brought
to W&L by the Glasgow Endowment Program,

Friedan’s Message For W&L

By W. PATRICK HINELY

For starters, a sidelight to the
historic occasion of Contact's first
women speaker: President Huntley
was the man who first suggested
to the Contact committee the idea
of having a woman speaker,

After delving through a bit of
well-put propoganda and plenty of
facts and examples of generaliza-
tions, Betty Friedan’s basic message
to us here at W&L, the oldest all-

male school in America, is clear
and simple: Change or be left
behind.

Ms. Friedan wasn't talking about
how things could be so much as
she was talking about how things
already are in the real world, i.e.,
in non-artificial sexually unsegregat-
ed places. Today more than ever
before, W&L is the proverbial
escape from the outside world. As
it is now, we are taking part in a
four-year cop-out under the auspices
of education.

Ms. Friedan pretty well destroyed
the myth of W&L by showing it for
what it is. The picture she painted
of an all-male world is, especially
for a place like this, sorry but
accurale,

What Ms. Friedan
about was a change in attitudes.
Her basic beliefs throw a lot of
what we live by out the window,
for reasons of sexism. The W&L
gentleman becomes, in her eyes, an
obselete social peculiarity.

The world she envisoins is one of
humans together, as people, not
specifically as men and women,
though the natural functions of sex

was talking

differences’ will undoubtedly remain
the source of much interest and
recreation, and of course procrea-
tion.

But what she was trying to get
across is that sex i.e., sexual inter-
course and any attachments it might
have, has been grossly misused and
exaggerated in our society. Think
about that the next time you're
checking out this month's play-
mate with your door locked and
whatever else you might be doing...

Not to demean the pleasure of
an orgasm, what she was saying
is that it is nothing more than a
good feeling, and that like anything
else that is good, it should be
shared, Sex in general is just one
facet of a diad relationship, be it
male-female, maleanale, female-
female, or whatever.

So next time you've got
litle honey in your bunk, make
sure she want to be there and
that both of you get off on what's
happening. This involves looking at

that

things a litthe more deeply than
many of us do now,
It means seeing a woman (girl,

chick, whatever) as more than just
a semen receptacle. She's your
friend, too, or should be.

If you really have any meaning-
ful feelings of affection for some-
one, whoever it is qualifies for the
label of “friend.” How do you treat
your friends? And more important,
who are you a friend to?

Of course, it's hard to live by
this when women are around in
such small numbers on an every-
day basis. We all live for the future,

some say, and on a short-term basis,
especially on Monday's. This means
figuring out how to have a good
time come Friday. So by Friday,
you thave clean sheets on the bed
and a pile of good records wait-
ing, the booze or grass ready for

convenient use, and the groovy
lights all ready ot go at the filck

of a switch,

That's not how it works. Cer-
tainly, any luxuries should always
be at your disposal, but remember:
people don't fit that category.

Ms. Friedan has foresight; too
much of it in the eyes of one girl
who questioned her in Lee Chapel,
who claimed that the Women’s
Rights Movement really hasn't got-

Get Out Of The CAC

In spite of another sterling performance by Washington
and Lee athletes at the “Winter Sports Festival,” or perhaps
because of it, it is time to take a long hard look at the
College Athletic Conference, and this university's role in it.
W&L ran away with the swimming crown, grabbed the
wrestling title, and finished a close second in basketball. The
Generals won the “big bell” last year, and are well on their
way to keeping it in Doremus. But does anybody care?

Founded in 1962, the CAC gave W&L an organized league
in which to compete. In particular, it filled the need that this
school had for a football conference. The CAC expanded, at
one time, into a rather vital organization, But in the last few
years it has deteriorated into a shell of a competitive con-
ference,

The latest “festival” showed once again the many weak-
nesses of the College Athletic Conference, The tourneys were
held on the “Mountain,” in Sewanee, Tennessee, a mere eight
hour bus ride from Lexington. Washington and Lee teams
left on a Wednesday and stayed until Sunday. They stayed
in a Holiday Inn, and “ate steak every night.” All this ex-
pense to compete against two other swimming squads, and
three teams in basketball and wrestling.

Time is another factor in this competition, Unfortunately,
W&IL athletes are students as well as “jocks.” Five days is
a lot of time to be away “from the books.” Combined with
distance and lack of inter-school relationships, time prevents
W&L from developing any kind of vigorous rivalry with any
of the CAC schools. It all boils down to—who really cares
if we win the CAC’s and bring home the “big bell”?

Earlier this year, Athletic Director Bill McHenry
nounced the formation of the VCAA, and with it W&L has
found the necessary replacement for the CAC. Financially,

all-

the costs will be minimal. The Associaiton can only promote
rivalries which have already begun, or which will form natur-
ally, W&L students cannot help but be more interested in a
win over Hampden-Sydney or Madison than a victory over
Centre. These are schools with which we have more in com-
mon than affiliation with the same conference. These are
people W&L students know, and are in competition with,

VCAA championships have so far been dominated by
W&L, with the exception of track. But there is promise for
the future. Interest is high, and all schools seem to be behind
the program.

With this in mind, we reccomend that Washington and
Lee withdraw from the CAC and concentrate on the VCAA.

Matmen, Swimmers Win,

Three teams remain close in
competition for the overall College
Athletic Conference sports champ-
ionship, following conclusion of the

W&L Lacrosse Opens Sat.

By RAY SWAN

Washington and Lee's lacrosse
team opens its 1973 season this
Saturday ‘against Morgan State at
Wilson Field. On Monday, Notre
Dame will invade Lexington for a
scrimmage.

The Generals will field a team
made up largely of juniors and
seniors, all veterans of several suc-
cessful seasons. New head coach
Jack Emmer is confident of the
team’s success, and stressed the im-
portance of the first half of the
season. “The question is, how fast

Washington and Lee’s stickmen warm up for Saturday’s home opener

can we develop our new system?”
In addition to Morgan State and
Notre Dame, W&L will face the
Washington Lacrosse Club and a
formidable list of opponents in the
Hero’s Tournament, March 22-25—
Hobart, Cornell, Maryland, Virginia,
Towson and Brown. All these teams
were ranked high in the national
polls last year.

W&L will play several teams for
the first time. C. W. Post, a Long
Island team, will give the Generals
an opportunity to recruit up north.
Princeton is also on the schedule

for the first time and should be a
strong team, having lost to Cornell
last year by only one point, 9-8,
Princeton will be one of the Ivy
League's best teams, along with
Cornell and Brown. Returning on
the schedule will be Towson, which
Emmer called one of the toughest
teams the Generals will face.

Emmer feels the Generals are
strongest on offense. “We'll definitely
get the goals, but I'm defensively
minded, It’s the defense that bails
you out when your offense is hav-
ing a bad day.” The coach feels
that W&L has superior stickhandlers
than his teams at Cortland St.

Emmer stressed the importance of
conditioning. A member of the la-
crosse staff said the team was being
worked very hard. Emmer said that
despite the tough workouts, there
has been no attrition, and the team
has responded well both to the con-
ditioning and the burden of learn-
ing a new coaching system.

While acknowledging W&L’s
past lacrosse record, Emmer noted
that the Generals have not won the
big games against such opponents
as Navy and Virginia. “I'd like to
see us win the tough games by one
or two goals instead of losing by

one or two goal margin of victory.

The Generals were not hurt seri-

Sam Englehart leads the returning
attackmen, and is joined ‘by Bryan
Chasney, Ken Daniels Bill Rienhoff,
Hank Slauson, and Dave Warfield.

W&L Wrestlers Defeated
In NCAA College Meet

Last Friday and Saturday, Lee
Keck and Doug Ford wrapped up
Washington and Lee's wrestling
schedule when they journeyed to
South Dakota State University to
represent the Generals in the NCAA
meet.

Lee Keck, wrestling at 118
pounds lost in this first match on
a riding time decision by a one
point margin, 7-6.

Doug Ford also lost his first
match. Ford wrestled at 167 pounds

and lost by an 8-1 score, Both
Keck and Ford were eliminated
from further competition after
their first loss,

On the year, Keck’s record of
16-8-2 was surpassed ‘by Ford's,
19-5; Overdorff, 12-2-1; White, 11-
3-2; Melton, 10-4-2; Stieff, 12-3-1

and Lewis, 11-5-1 (all except Keck
and Ford’s are only for dual meets.)

The team as a whole sported a
13-5 record and among its accolades
were a first place in the VCAA, a

Doug Ford fell 8-1 in his first match. A

 

first in the CAC championships and
a fourth in the Lebanon Valley
Invitational Tournament,

Coach John Piper said that na-
turally he was very happy with the
way the season developed and that
he was looking forward to stiffer
competition next season, Coach
Piper went on to say that the team
has “taken a big step in two years”
and that it “will be tough to keep
up the napid pace” of development.

In Piper's opinion, the biggest
upset W&L pulled off all season was
the Duke match where W&L came
out on the winning side of a 22-20
score. This was undoubtedly the
season’s most exciting match. On
the gloomier side, Piper considered
the loss to Pembroke State the
most disappointing.

With the General's winning atti-
tude now firmly — instilled, and

though continually good recruiting
by Piper, W&L’s wrestling future
appears to be a long line of solid,
winning teams.

   

 

sophomore, the 167 pounder

will be back next year. Coach Piper foresees an even better squad next
year. With another good recruiting year, W&L’s grappling future

appears to be bright,

Track Team Places
Fifth In VCAA’s

By KEN RUSCIO

Washington and Lee's trackmen
completed the indoor phase of their
season last Saturday by placing
fifth in the VCAA_ championships
at Lynchburg. Virginia State's speed
on the track and agility in the field
resulted in an easy team victory
for them in the eight-team meet
Competition for second place was
much closer, however, as only five
points separated second-place Lynch-
burg from fifth-place W&L. Roa-
noke’s Bill Warner led from the
start to capture the mile as did
Virginia State's Tom Anderson in
the 600 yard run in the meet’s most
impressive victories. Following close
to Anderson in second was W&L’s
Brandon Herbert, who later finish-
ed an outstanding indoor season by
an horing the mile relay to second
behind powerful Virginia State.
Providing the momentum for him
on the preceeding legs were Phifer

Helms, Dave Lawson, and fresh-
man Willie-Bob Wingfield.
Paul Suthern continued his im-

pressive hurdling by taking second
in the highs and fourth in the lows,
Once again VSC was the spoiler
winning the highs and placing
second and third on the lows, Bill
Kalal’s fourth place finish in the
two mile provided the only other
points on the track for WAL.

The field event men gained sev-
eral crucial points for the Generals.
Shotputters Phil Jones and Bob
Fallis placed third and fourth while
Paul Hartmann pole-vaulied to a
third place finish. Frank Porter
atoned for a previously frustrating
season when he took third in the
high jumps. Barclay Armstrong
triple-jumped and long-jumped his
way to two fifth-places.

Despite several excellent individ-
val performances, the fifth-place
finish was a disappointment to the
team, Entering the meet as a top
contender, the Generals were un-
able to exhibit the depth which
produced their previous wins, most
notably the Lynchburg Relays. The
outdoor season, however, appears
promising. Many of the distance
runners as well as the field event
men are beginning to reach their
top form after two months of con-
ditioning. The sprinters and hurdlers
successfully competed among the
best in the state and the outdoor

Revamped WEGL Ruggers
Open Season With ODU

The W&L rugby team opened
practice on Monday, Feb. 26 and,
according to player-coach Larry
Cohen, there will be a number of
changes designed to produce a win-
ning season.

One big change will be that the
players will have their own practice
field at Lylburn-Downing Elemen-
tary School. “We feel that practicing
during the day on a_ full-sized
field as opposed to last fall’s night
practice, will go a long way to
helping our timing and condition-
ing,” said Cohen. “In addition there
will be a great number of personnel
changes, especially among our backs.
We have ‘been doing some extremely
active recruiting this winter and the
effects should show up in both the
size and conditioning of our play-
ers.”

There is a good possibility that
the only backs who were on last
fall's “A” team who will remain
this spring will be Cohen at scrum
half and co-captain Ron Vaught at
wing. “We have some excellent ex-
perienced backs who are coming out
from other fall sports and several
men who had left school and have
now returned,” commented Cohen.
Leading candidates include junior
Rob Konwinski at flyhalf, a very
quick experienced player who was
injured most of last spring; alumnus
Rob Hessler at center, one of the
stars of last spring's fine showing at
the National Championships and
an extremely quick starter and hard
hitter; sophomore Jeff Davies who
gained his rugby experience in South
Africa; Jay Costan at wing, a sec-
ond year law student who has played
the position for three years at Uni-
versity of Virignia; and Bob Cook,
a starter at wing in 1971 who has

now returned to school,

Among the scrum or line there
will be stiff competition for start-
ing spots as veteran props Sam
Lewis and John Weigel battle with
Arch Christian and Ed McLaughlin.
The second row positions will be
up for grabs among Tom Mc-
Junkin, Jeff Burke, Dave Johnson
and Arch Frierson, all of whom go
over 200 pounds. Lock will prob-
ably be chosen from among Dave
Campbell, Hunt Harding or Scott
Brown, all of whom have seen ex-
perience at the position, Campbell
and Harding may have the inside
track, however, because of their
greater height. The key position of
hooker will probably belong to
three-year veteran Steve Sutton, al-
though he will be pushed by senior
Ray McGrath and sophomore Skip
Whitehurst.

Fullback, a vital position will
probably develop into a battle be-
tween veteran Scott Brown and
junior Rolf Piranian, According to
Cohen, “Piranian is a natural for
fullback. He can kick well with
both feet, is extremely quick and
will probably be one of the hardest
hitters on the team.” His biggest
disadvantage will be lack of ex-
perience in a pressure position.

The wing forward or lineback-
ing positions will be competed for
by veterans Taylor Marion; Jim
Kahn, co-captain; Jim Telling and
Bucky Leslie. “We had a great deal
of trouble at this spot last fall,”
said Cohen. “this will be a position
that will be nailed down by a person
who is in the best shape and who
is the hardest hitter regardless of
his experience.”

Coeducation Vote To Be Monday

standardized multifariousness, ‘The
student genuinely interested in an
all men’s institution of higher learn-
ing has now only a handful of
schools remaining from which to
select,

We here at Washington and Lee,
in view of this deplorable situation,
must consider the issue of coeduca-
tion not only in light of our great
heritage but in terms of the survival
of choice; the preservation of what
we, as an all-men’s college, have to
otter.

rhe burden of selfless objectivity
is often difficult to bear, But those
that have the courage to assume it
will realize yet another persuading
reason why Washington and Lee
must remain an all men’s college.

Con

lo the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

This letter concerns an event
which is becoming as traditional as
Pavilion grain parties and Fancy
Dress. | am speaking of the an-
nual student referendum on coeduca-
tion. The advocates of this edu-
cational philosophy extole its ab-
stract “virtues” and are content to
ignore its possible material effects
on an institution such as Washing-
ion and Lee.

An example of this abstract way
of thinking was provided by an
eminent faculty member of the Uni-
versity Council who, in last year’s

Friedan Well Received

(Continued trom page 3)
ten anywhere, Ms, Friedan spoke
back to her from the viewpoint of
a decade of experience, saying pro-
gress has been made, that the ice-
cap is starting to melt. Ms, Friedan
was working on reform before this

chick was even wearing a bra,

much less thinking about burning §

it

In essence, Ms. Friedan made a
point which Johnny White did dur-
ine Black Culture week and that
Dick Gregory spoke of also, That
point is that our viewport is limit-
ed by the present makeup of the
W&L “community.” We are de-
prived of different persepetives by
the fact that we have too much in
common: we are all white males.

When we get out of here, we're
going to have a hard time relating
to blacks and women in the “real”
world because we have seen so
little of them,

You can shrug all this off and stick
to any outmoded ways you might
have, but make you're not
alone. because when you paint your
self into a corner, you're going to
need a lot of help getting out.

Step one of the de-juvenation and
rejuvenation of W&L is next Mon-
day. | would say we should all
critically examine our status quo
and its shortcomings before approv-
ing its preservation.

debate on the subject stated that
“We should first decide whether co-
education as a philosophy is desir-
able. Then we can study its possible
cost to and effects on W&L.” My
point is that one cannot separate
the concept from the effects of its
concrete application.

Nhe present plan of the Com-
mittee to Study Coeducation calls
for the expansion of W&L’s under-
graduate enrollment to 1800, or an
increase of 28%. One would as-
sume that all of the additional 400
students would sign up for classes.
Yet, I have heard no mention of
any proposed corresponding — in-
crease in the size of the W&L
faculty, The professor quoted above
has stated that the enlargement of
a closs from 45 to 60 students
would (or should) have no effect
on the way in which the class is
conducted. Granted, in some large
100-level lecture courses these addi-
tional students would cause no prob-
lems. I just hope that, should
WAL ever decide to “go coed,” this
professor will be able to persuade
all 400 coeds not to enroll in any
courses where individual attention
would be hampered by substantial
increase in class size.

We are fooling ourselves if we
think that W&L’s excellent is based
merely on its convenient location,
its excellent faculty, and its fabulous
facilities. The location is bearable,
the professors are excellent, and the
facilities are—for the most part—
adequate. However, it is the avail-
ability of these professors and these
facilities to all students (an avail-
ability unheard of in larger schools)
that makes Washington and Lee the
fine institution that it is.

only points by placing fifth in the
high hurdles—no small accomplish-
ment considering the class competi-
tion and several false starts by his
opponents, Bill Kalal’s 9:56 two
mile, his first time under 10 minutes,
was another bright spot. W&L’s
mile relay of Brandon Herbert,
Dave Estes, Phifer Helms, and Dave
Lawson withdrew, however, due to
Lawson's pulled muscle incurred in
an afternoon 440 trial.

William and Mary repeated its
powerful performance of last year
by easily running away with the
team tithe as well as several individ-
ual championships. Most of their
can be contributed to a
strong squad of runners which cap-
tured the hurdles, 600, 880, and
mile; an example of their superior
depth was displayed in the mile
where they placed four of the first
5 finishers—a sweep imerrupted only
by Roanoke’s Bill Warner and his
desperation last-lap finish. The indi-
vidual star of the meet was the
University of Virginia's Paul Meyer.
After winning the three mile in the
afternoon, he returned that evening
to capture the two-mile in record
time, easily outsprinting his three
William and Mary opponents.
