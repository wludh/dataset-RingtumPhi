Applications For Dormitory Counselors Sought

Applications are invited for the position of Freshman and Upper-
class Dormitory Counselors for the 1973-74 academic year. These
positions are considered to be among the most responsible entrusted
to Washington and Lee students.

In order to ensure the greatest possible contact with freshmen,
counselors are provided with a single room in the dormitory and the
dinner meal in Evans Dining Hall, which they are expected to eat
with freshmen. Each counselor will also be expected to live in his
dormitory room seven nights a week and CANNOT HAVE AN
OFF-CAMPUS APARTMENT,

The primary basis of selection of counselors will be that of gen-
eral fitness to aid in making the Freshman Dormitories an adequate
environment for a student's freshman year,

Students who are presently Dormitory Counselors and who wish
to reapply for next year should submit letters to this effect to the
Dean of Students’ office BY 4:00 P.M. ON FRIDAY, JANUARY
26. In addition, returning counselors should indicate in their letter
if they wish to apply for Head Counselor or Assistant Head Coun-
selor,

New applications for counselor positions in the freshman and
upperclass dormitories should be filed in the office of the Dean of
Students by 4:00 P..M. ON FRIDAY, JANUARY 26. Such applica-
tions should be in letter form and should contain all information
that will be helpful to the Selection Committee, including previous
experience and the reasons for wanting the position,

All applicants for counselor positions will be interviewed by the
Head and Assistant Head Dormitory Counselors. Applicants will be
notified of the time for interviews after January 26.

Reading Day Is Favored
By Students, Poll Shows

Most students are in favor of a

reading day before final exams, and
most students don’t consider value
judgments as Honor System viola-
tions, according to the Executive
Committee's Independent Exam poll
results announced Monday at the
EC meeting.
Bob Brennan said that
there were two main conclusions
which were drawn both from the
poll itself and from various com-
ments made by students in filling
out the poll sheet. He said there
were a host of statements made by
students on these two issues.

President

Taking account of the general
favoritism for a reading day, the
EC considered two main proposals.
First, that a reading day be added
before exams start in the Fall Term,
as is the case currently in the Winter
Term, and second that exam week
be lengthened by a day either by
holding exams on Sunday during
exam week or by extending the end
of exam week one day.

The discussion on a reading day,
however, was tabled until the next
meeting so that each EC membe:
could examine the present schedul
ing on exam weeks during the Fall
and Winter Terms

As brought out by
Brittin, the current view of the EC
towards value judgments is that
such judgments may constitute an
honor violation, The current word
ing of the EC's view would, it

gards to what a value judgment is
and whether it is actually a viola-

tion,

Most of the questions asked on
the independent exam poll were
answered in a one-sided manner by
the student body. For example, on

the question asking if the inde-

OUTLOOK and REVIEW}
Keeping Exams Independent

A lot of people—students and faculty alike—seem to be
rather exercised over independent exams lately. The [xecu-
tive Committee not only took the trouble to run, on this
subject, another in its seemingly endless series of polls; it
actually called meetings in the freshman dormitories recently
to discuss the issue.

According to our informed sources close to the faculty,
Independent Exams seems to be a topic of high priority
currently on professorial lips. The issue continues to be dis-
cussed at University Council and Faculty meetings.

Many students suspect that there is a move on the part
of some faculty members to do away with the examination
privilege. An the immediate reaction of most students to this
prospect, is, understandably, sheer horror,

We students have come to live with independent exams
over the years and, if one conclusion can be drawn from the
EC poll evaluation, student sentiment is almost universally
pro, The independent set-up takes all the chance and arbitrari-
ness out of scheduling finals, and that’s a very good thing
indeed.

The main objections to the independent exam system have
been (1) that it constitutes a strain on the Honor System
and (2) that it is an undue burden for faculty members.

First, we don’t see any way of getting around the claim
that students are tempted to make “value judgements” about
their exams (e.g., “it was easy,” or “it was hard,” or “*!?*!?").

The EC poll demonstrates that not only are “value judge-
ments” tempting but also are forthcoming in great frequency
and virtually unavoidable. We admit this, but don’t see that
it is that important to questions of honor,

The real significant question lies in whether any out-and-out
cheating is going on. And every indication is—no more than
would otherwise be the case. If blatant discussion of exams
during the period is detected, there is no reason why it cannot
be reported and the Honor System enforced.

The strain on the Honor System would come when stu-
dents were told by the faculty: we trust you to be honest in
other affairs, but when it come to something important, like
finals, we'd just as soon not try your integrity.

As for the second objection, we can sympathize with a pro-
fessor who must grade exams piecemeal throughout the exam
period, when his objectivity woud be better served by grading
them all in a batch. This must be a real problem from the
faculty viewpoint, and we can only suggest that the deadline
for submission of final grades to the registrar be extended if
at all possible. It would be preferable to sacrifice those holi-
day grade reports (which usually come along after parents
have been sufficiently prepared and subdued anyway) than
to sacrifice the independent exam option,

Lyndon Baines Johnson RIP

As Americans our lives, to a great extent, revolve around
the Presidency—more than any other single man, the Presi-
dent, in his words and actions, reaches out and touches our
lives.

We are all aware of this; we don't really need a cadre of
journalists to remind us constantly of this fact.

Yet the point comes home hard, following an amazing suc-
cession of events over the last few weeks—a former President
dead, a current President inaugurated, another former Presi-

 

dent dead,

More than the passing of Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson's
death has stunned everyone—not only in its suddeness, but
also in its occurrence so soon after Johnson was in the very
center of some of the most tortured years this country has
ever seen.

Again, unlike Truman, Johnson's presence has been very
real and immediate to our college generation, All of us
remember the day in school when we heard the awful, be
wildering news from Dallas, the same day Lyndon Johnson
rose to the Presidency.

Then came the steady escalation of Viet Nam, the accelera-
tion of draft calls... and Johnson became subject to our
suspicions, then our criticism, and then, from many of us,
our hate,

Now that he is dead, a thousand typewriters will pound
out a thousand editorials—the man's great mistakes will be
laid aside, at least for awhile. Like John Kennedy, he will
probably be exonerated in death, snatched from an atmos:
phere of harsh criticism.

Lyndon Johnson was a thoroughly political man. In life,
he thrived in the midst of controversy—so in death, there is
no need to cover up his failures, He fell from power w eighted
down by his own arrogrance over the Viet Nam debacle; and
that grim lesson, so painfully gained, should not be lost with
him,

But he deserved, even in life, more respect and gratitude
than he received from us, No one can deny that he was an
effective and courageous President. As a legislator and a
moving force in his party, he was unsurpassed, \nd the Civil
Rights Acts can be credited, almost totally, to his vigorous
efforts.

As one small college newspaper, we wish to add our voice
to the many others expressing sorrow for the loss of a national

leader and a decent man,

Student Slams Editor’s ‘Bigotry’

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

It was with great interest that I
read the editorial concerning the
problems involved with the recruit-
ment of black students to the W&L
campus. The article was precise in
its assessment of the situation. I
hate to say that was the extent of
its merit.

The author should be warned that
the freedom of speech is a privilege
that should be used only by those
who have respect for the principle,
and not for the journalistic extra-
vagance of an immature young edi-
tor. The author of that editorial
disguised snobbery, bigotry, and
prejudice under the heading of re-
sponsible journalism and the free-
dom of mankind to function in free
and open society.

The writer of that editorial went
to excesses to abuse a group of
students which have in no way
offended him. The contemporary
black man does not think very
highly of individuals who make un-
warranted statements about him.
The editor of the Ring-tum Phi
used the power of his position to
institute his values upon the student
body of Washington and Lee.

In a blatant piece of character
assassination, he distorted the pic-
ture concerning the recruitment
situation, then he took time out to
interject some of his distorted values
concerning the type of black student
that “should” be attracted to W&L.
| do not resent his apparent pre-
judice; | do however, strongly resent
his pompous elitist type statements
concerning the black students here
already, and the ones that should
be attracted to W&L.

In both instances, the editor made
statements that were bigoted in tone
and implication. Some of the re-
marks made were on par with any-
thing Jim Clark or George Wallace
could have possibly expressed to-
ward Black people.

If you were really concerned
about doing a responsible job that
would have given honor to your
position, as opposed to the disgrace
that you have brought to both the
school and the paper, you would
have done your homework. Since
you are concerned with creatively
writing your prejudices and not with
truth, | will do it for you.

First of all, blacks and under-
privileged are not synonymous
terms. No Black man who is here
feels underprivileged. Not having
money is not a criteria for being
underprivileged. As a matter of fact,
were you to examine the situation,
many whites are here on financial
aid also. Are they undeprivileged
too? What you wrote last week
shows that, to a certain extent, you
are very underprivileged.

The next point is that you went
to great lengths to vindicate the
Student Recruitment Committee and
the Administration for what has
been assessed by everyone as a poor
job. Why must whites always save
other whites, even when their mis-
takes are so obvious?

You then do a good job (yes |

cause of the problem, a cause that
all of the members of the Ad-
ministration should know (and do
know, | might add). But like many
whites, your ego got in the way
of your judgment and you blew it,

You are going to be shocked by
this but you're not as smart as
you thing you are Mr, Editor. The
fact is that you're quite childish and
actually stupid. You fail to see that
many Blacks can do the work here
at W&L, but that these Blacks are
not the “white” oriented ones that
you desire to either know or as-
sociate with,

The position that you so perfectly
distorted in your editorial does not
have a five or six year remedial
stipulation to it. You are so blind
until you couldn't see that this is
not the way that W&L should move.
However, you fail to see that there
are Blacks—Blacks who for some
reason or another do not have your
“lily white” standards—who could
attend W&L and do quite well.
These kids get dealt out of a
chance to attend a school like W&L
because of the studly middle class
twerps like you. They're in all black
high schools that your recruiters
don't go to because they're scared
or too snobbish to venture into,
There are poor kids who are strug-
gling to get ahead in a world full
of people like you. Kids who would
give their back teeth to put up with
all that tripe you said should at-
tract a “black” to W&L. Kids that
are faced with having the stigma of
being a good black, from all black
schools, “but as we know, white
schools and black schools teach dif-
ferently, and that the black kids
would have problems in learning in
a white school like W&L.”

Look man, you're not doing any
black guy a big favor by letting him
come here, the blacks here have
all learned bitter lessons here at old
WAL. Bitter lessons that will last
« long time. And your comments
surely didn't make things easier to
stomach around here.

What the black students are try-
ing to tell you smart, white people
is that your doing the recruitment
program all wrong regarding blacks,
you aren't listening and you're
mouthing off incorrectly and while
its academic to you, its essential to
our survival,

Stop looking for “white” black
students; you're not Harvard, you're
a damn good school and the black
students are proud to be associated
with you, but you're not going to
get the truly outstanding black stu-
dent. He is going elsewhere. You
profess to be a great teaching insti-
tution; we want to give you a chance
to prove that.

Finally, it's come to my attention
several times that you are co1-
cerned about lowering your stand-
ards to accept black students who
are not outstanding (since only out-
standing blacks can do the work
here). You lower the standards for
alumni sons don't you? Why not
for Blacks? Does money truly
motivate you that much? Honesty
is very important in this matter—

"On Black Recruitment”
(Reprinted from issue of January 10, 1973)

Now is the time, after four years of success and frustration,
to take stock of the university’s efforts to recruit underpriviledged
students, And first, let us make it clear, we are talking primarily
about black recruitment, for black men have made up the bulk of

There is a lot of dissatisfaction going around concerning the
plight of the black students who are here now and the fact that
dwindling numbers of black students have been enrolled each year.
This dismay was brought into focus during last week's University
Council Meeting, during which Dean of Admissions James Farrar
gave the figures which tell the story.

The recruitment effort reached its zenith in September of 1970,
when, out of 36 blacks applying, 24 were accepted, and 15 were
enrolled, The following year, about the same number applied, 19
were accepted, but only four enrolled. In September of this year,
another 29 applied, 16 were accepted, and only three came.

How can this decline in numbers enrolled be explained? Johnny
Morrison, a junior representing the Student Association for Black
Unity, blamed the failure on a “lack of knowledge and experience”
in the recruiting program, But if the Student Recruiting Committee
can be faulted at all, it is not for their lack of industry, They have
proved themselves to be one of the hardest-working groups on this

The big reason WAL is not getting these black students is, of
course, the competition we receive from other colleges and universi-
ties, Contrary to widespread opinion, admissions standards have not
been arbitrarily lowered for black and underpriviledged applicants,
True, SAT board scores are, on the average, some 100-110 points
lower for the recruited students, But the admissions committee has
never held to these standardized tests as a rigid indicator, either for
whites or blacks; Dean Farrar steadfastly maintains that black
students are accepted on the same criterion as others, ic., their
ability to do the work at Washington and Lee.

Naturally, those black students who can do the work here are
going to be courted by the Ivy League and other prestigious institu-
tions, And this is where W&L has been losing out,

Two suggestions have come out of recent discussion on this
issue. One is that W&L should embark on a remedial five-or-six-year —
program, which would allow us to take underprivileged students ©
with whom we would not face stiff competition from other schools,
Secondly, it has been proposed that a man be hired to work in the
admissions office solely for recruitment of underprivileged students.

We object to both of these proposals, The first is, in essence,
lowering standards to fill a racial quota, a course which has led to
nothing but alienation and ill feelings on other campuses. The second
idea is undesirable, not only from the standpoint of having an
admissions man catering solely to one group, but also from the
standpoint of cost. Money to pay his salary would be money taken

There are things about W&L which should attract the black
student, just as they attract the white. The location and size, the
quality of instruction, and the curriculum are all aspects which allow
us to compete with any other school.

We must, however be realistic about both our goals and our
limitations as an institution, As a private college, we cannot afford
to outbid state universities for black students. As Dean Farrar has
said, our best bet to convince a black student to come here is to
show him the campus and introduce him to students. Herein lies

The EC must keep this in mind as they consider the Recruit-
ment Committee's proposal for an allocation to provide a “Recruit-
ment Weekend.” Black applicants could be brought to Lexington for
a few days in a context much like the familiar Spring Scholarship
weekend, A small investment here could perhaps provide the greatest

The one problem with Azteca is

A Tour of Some
Lexington Sites

By J. JASON MATTHEWS

Recently | wrote about the wond-
erful opportunities afforded the stu-
dent by the W&L campus. Now I
write to inform those who don’t
know or don’t care about Lexington
and all it’s delightful possibilities.
Many times, on the “hill” or in dif-
ferent apartments | overhear dis-
gruntled students condemn Lexing-
ton as a “hole in the ground” or
as “a litter not fit for camels who
have just eaten many bushels of
green apples.” The following list
proves these pessimists wrong and
unable to continue functioning in
our society.

All around Lexington there are

delightful spots where the weary
student can find diversion,
THE ALBINO FARM’ ON

ROUTE 60: A_ fascinating socio-
logical study of how people se-
quester themselves due to the lack
of pigmentation in their skin. They
have constructed their own shacks
and live in an autonomous little
society. The curious should avoid
this place on sunny days as the
bright sunlight makes them irrit-
able. On one occasion they over-
turned a Rainbow bread truck which
had gotten lost.

THE OLD SITE OF NATURAL
BRIDGE: A little known fact that
Natural Bridge was once in Lex-
ington shocks many who hear it
for the first time. Due to lack of
tourist draw, the geographical phe-
nomenon was transferred to another

location in the hopes that more
profits would be possible.
THE OL D_ LEXINGTON

STOCKYARDS: Once a thriving in-
dustry in the town, the stockyards
provided the whole county with
freshly butchered meat. It was closed
down in the early 50's due to dis-
quieting rumors that the average
number of hepatitus cases had risen

considerably that year and the mys-
terious disappearance of the man
who operated the lard vats. It was
located on the hill which over-
looks the present High School and
the Bus Station.

THE HOME MAD JENNIE: A
Civil War widow, Mad Jennie was
supposed to have been livid with
envy on hearing of the courageous
exploits of Barbara Fritchie in
Frederick, Maryland. As the Union
forces of Gen. Bruce Shirley, a little
Known officer in the war, passed
through Lexington, Mad Jennie
leaned out her window which was
on Main Street, and shouted ob-
scenities at the passing forces. Gen,
Shirley, already in a bad mood be-
cause he had gotten lost and was
forced to march through Lexington,
gave a terse order. The cannon ball
that passed through Jennie’s window
and through Jennie herself as a
matter of fact, can be seen at the
Stonewall Jackson House.

THE GALAX TAR PITS: In a
situation much like that of Natural

Bridge, the Galax Tar Pits, after
being searched thoroughly to as-
certain that no prehistoric fossils

were contained therein, were moved
to Lexington as they offended the
residents of Galax by their acrid
odor and unpleasant appearance.
They cannot be seen now as they,
(the Tar Pits), were offended by
Lexington and moved to an un-
disclosed location.

Leslie Resigns As Coach;
McHenry Named

By MARK BROWNLEE

Last Thursday, in a surprise de-
cision, President Robert E. R. Hunt-
ley announced the resignation of
head football coach H. Graham
(Buck) Leslie, and the appointment
of Athletic Director William D.
(Bill) McHenry to replace him, The
decision was reached over a relative-
ly short period of time. Early last
week, Coach Leslie approached the
AD and asked to be relieved of
his duties as head coach. Coach
Leslie, in a letter to President
Huntley, said that he had reached
the decision “as a result of long
and careful consideration.”

After accepting Leslie's resigna-
tion, Huntley immediately turned to
McHenry, who had plenty of coach-
ing experience at Lebanon Valley,
and who stated that he had missed
coaching. While at Lebanon Valley,
McHenry served as both head foot-
ball coach and athletic director.
His football teams at Lebanon com-
piled a 44-34-1 record, winning one
Middle Atlantic Conference champ-

 

McHenry takes on dual role. It
will be a challenge.

ionship and tying for another. Previ-
ously, he had coached at Penn-
sylvania Military College and Wil-
liams College.

Coach Leslie, a W&L alumnus
like McHenry, had joined the Blue
football staff in 1959, at a time
when the Generals had won bui
two games in the last four seasons.
As Coach McLaughlin's offensive
coordinator, he helped lead W&L
to seasons of 3-4-1, 8-0-1, 9-0, 8-1,
and 5-3 over the next five years.

Leslie had taken over the reins
as temporary head coach when Me-
Laughlin had died in an electrical
accident in August, 1968, Early in
1969, he was named head coach,

Leslie's 1971 team finished fast,

games. Hopes were
last season, The Generals had a
veteran ball club back, but after

winning its first game over a highls
touted Westminster team, the Gen-
erals could come up with only two
wins in their next eight games. For
his five year tenure as head coach,
Leslie had a 16-28-1 record.

As the new head coach, McHenry
hopes to revamp the recruiting
methods, so as to bring in new stu-
dents, who can help the school as
well as the athletic program. The
job will still be a difficult one, as
WAL still athletic schol-
arships. Another that he
faces IS a somelimes apathetic stu
dent body. McHenry feels that there
are many potential players at W&l
who don't give the football program
a fair chance.

oifers no
problem

For next year, the new Head
Coach has set up a full-scale J.V.
schedule. He has also planned for
another pre-season contest with Get

tysburg College, in addition to the

Bridgewater scrimmage. Two vars-
ity schedule changes have been
made. Hamilton College of New
York will replace Westminster, and

Randolph-Macon will replace Tow-
son State.

Personnel-wise. McHenry will
miss several of this year’s seniors,
but feels that he has a good nucleus
with which to work, Lewis Powell
is expected to provide the leader-
ship, and with his running ability

entor

and the return of Jim Farrar, Mc-
Henry feels that he might give the
Wishbone a try. Next year’s attack
will be more wide open, but will
still be based on the principle of
ball control. McHenry is especially
pleased with his two co-captains Bob
Brand and Bill Wallace.

His coaching staff will have Leslie
working as the offensive coordina-

tor, Piper with the offensive line,
Williams with the the front four,
Emmer with the linebackers, and
Aldridge with the secondary.
With his large staff, McHenry
feels that he won't have too much

of a problem handing both of his
roles, He did both at Lebanon, and
says that it will be easier at W&L.

Washington and Lee athletics is

more expansive than Lebanon's,
with more sports, better facilities
and a larger athletic staff. Coach

McHenry is looking forward to the
1973 season, and is especially pleas-
ed that he has coach Leslie return-
ing to the position which he per-
formed so well five years ago. “Some
of Washington and Lee's greatest
were when Buck
was in charge of our offense under
the late Lee McLaughlin. | am
happy that he will be helping me
in this same capacity.”

Varsity basketball action against ODU last Saturday.

Frosh Basketball Goes 6-1,
Shows Talent, But Lacks Socks

By JIM MOZINGO

Coach Tom Davies and his fresh-
man basketball team put on quite
an impressive performance Monday
night, even though they were play-
ing the W&L JV. The final score:
100-66. Not only did they score
well, they showed excellent team
play. The scoring was balanced and
all seven players on the frosh team
exhibited their potential at one time
or another.

The freshman were much more
impressive at the end of the first
half than they were the rest of the
game, but throughout they showed
the talent that has not only given
them a 6-1 record but the potential

that should give Head Coach Verne
Canfield an excellent sophomore
class to choose from.

The team seems
coached by Tom
proud of his team and program.
Davies commented that this team
has great unity; “They never fight at
practice,” Davies also noted that his
freshmen usually play more man-
to-man defense than they did Mon-
day night, but that only being allow-
ed seven players and several getting
into foul trouble, he had been un-
able to let them loose. Davies
charges seemed quite aggressive,
though in the second half there was
a noticable lapse of enthusiasm on

the boards. The first year Generals
also proved their poise under pres-
sure, when they easily drove the
JV out of a man-to-man press.

Despite the obvious ability of the
freshmen it was apparent that theit
performance lacked the one thing
that could turn these athletes into
the team they are fully capable of
being. A quick glance told all of
those at the game what they needed
desperately but lacked; new game
socks, This seemed atrocious to those
of us concerned with the W&L
basketball program. How can play
ers feel secure when they go in on

Roundballers Give Scare to ODU;
Fall to Rollins in 70-59 Decision

By BILL AUSTIN

The following of Washington and
Lee’s basketball fortunes sometimes
includes a rare, unexpected surprise.
Though the past week's activity
evidenced a pair of rather predict-
able losses, Saturday's 74-68 de-
feat at the hands of a strong Old
Dominion squad proved to hold jusi
that special kind of discovery, the
nameless sort of exuberance that
comes from the meeting and grap-
pling of two finely tuned teams.

Quite frankly, ODU’s accomp-
lishments particularly its consecu-
tive conquests of Dayton and
Xavier, seemed to warrant a genu-
ine concern for Canfield’s up and
down bunch. Indeed, the Monarchs
of Norfolk, Va., had come within
a point of upsetting VPI, and only
a month ago had silenced all poll-
sters touting Roanoke College as

the small college leader with a
five point victory over the previ-
ously top-ranked squad,

Yet, for a 20 minute period,
W&L gunned over ODU’s favorite
vehicle of defense, its 2-3 zone,
and displayed the poise of an ex-
perienced, gutsy club. Down by five
points in the early going, the Gen-
erals spent the rest of the period
on virtually even terms with the
favored visitors. The half's final
three minutes provided all those
fortunate enough to be spectators
with a game of contrasts: ballet-
like fulidity and fierce agressiveness.
In those few minutes, W&L actu-
ally took a precious, significant lead
of two points.

Contributors to this flowering of
success included Skip Lichtfuss, flu-
cursed earlier in the week, who
nevertheless showed reckless skill in

$ boys this year.

WLUR Bottom 10...
Do you accept the challenge?

Even though we know they’re too scared to
accept, we challenge the “Bottom 10” of WLUR
to a rematch basketball game on Friday, Feb. 2,
during halftime of the W&L-Bridgewater home
game. To avenge our loss last year (in a game in
which WLUR had conveniently supplied the score-
: keeper), we promise to shellac the “rip and read”’

collecting 14 first half points and
several vital offensive rebounds, His
inside work complimented well the
floating 20 footers of Bowman Wil-
liams. Defensively, Coach Canfield’s
numerous substitutions offered a
formidable obstacle to ODU's obvi-
ously bothered attack. Though
Copeland, the team’s splendid for-
ward, managed 14 points, Rick
Michaelson, a burly gunner of ar-
rogant disposition, shot a_ bullish
4-11. Of special importance, Rick
Nau, a small guard of definite class,
threw away passes, missed shots,
and looked outhustled under the
close coverage of guards Smith and
Clelan,

With the second half’s opening
tip came a defensive alteration by
ODU's perturbed Allen, He ordered
his squad to play man-to-man, a
gamble that paid off with a reclaim-
ing of the lead. Indeed, for four
minutes, W&L scored only a single
point, and the resulting 45-40 ODU
lead never crumbled.

It was threatened, excitingly, for
the home team still possessed the
intangible knowledge that it could
win this game, an intuitiveness that
defied a common sense acceptance
of defeat. It showed when a 10
point ODU margin fell to four at
66-62 with under four minutes re-
maining. However, a Coach Allen
time-out, followed by a clever Nau
lay-up, checked the erosion and pre-
served the ODU margin.

The 74-68 win included 20 points
for Copeland, while Tom Street,
seldom such a pervasive force at
center, contributed 15 points and 16
rebounds, For W&L, Lichtfuss led
with 24 points, followed by 17
from the zone-taunting Williams,

The victory kept ODU's streak
intact at five, while Washington and
Lee received the inadequate com-

pensation of a .500 record and the
chance to unbalance the percentages
the following Monday.

Which it did . . . The opponent
was Rollins College, a no-name bas-
ketball school with a very big name
as its head coach. Ed Jucker brought
a couple of NCAA championships
to the University of Cincinnati a
decade ago. In that golden era, his
trademarks included a consuming
intensity for the game and a pas-
sion for good, tight defense. Both
were in evidence Monday night, as
Jucker barked orders and directed
a tenacious man-to-man coverage.
For W&L, the switch from ODU's
relatively generous zone to. this
hungary, scrapping defense did not
prove beneficial.

Rollins won the game, 70-59, and
proved conclusively that a team of
modest talents can succeed with a
strict adherence to the fundamentals
of the sport, with a patience for the
good shot. The first half witnessesd
the steady, unspectacular battling of
two evenly matched units, though
the shooting of Rollins’ Lonnie
Butler led the team to a 30-26 half-
time bulge.

The final period held the key, and
the mystery to the outcome, W&l
captured the lead for the initial
five minutes when Rollins scored
only once. With a six point margin
at 38-32, the encounter changed
drastically, permanently. The brief
lead disappeared, and a tough,
floor-smashing kind of contest
emerged, W&L maneuvered ably in
the scramble, but neglected to score.
Following Lichtfuss’ basket which
knotted the score at 40, Rollins ran
off 12 unanswered points, blending
a little-used fast break with plain
hard-working defnse. All the while,

“It’s easy” says Coach Stearns.
“You name the whole team swimmer

he did in the wake of the Wash-

60-53, and Davidson, 81-30. The
Generals knowing that they were

to kick, pull and stroke to their

and Coach Stearns feels that this
again will be important when the
tankmen take on William and Mary
this Saturday.

Washington and Lee has not won
against the Indians in recent mem-

ory, and although William and
Mary has one of its perenially
strong teams, the Generals are

counting on depth to help them pull

an upset. Both teams have lost
only to U.Va., but William and
Mary finished second in state last

year and are looking forward to the
big number one spot this year. The
Generals are travelling to Williams-
burg this weekend, hoping to upset
their hosts, Cautiously optimistic,
Coach Stearns says it will be our
depth against William and Mary’s
individual stars.

Before this big clash on Saturday,
however, the Generals host Lynch-
burg College and Roanoke College
in a preview of the VCAA champ-
ionship in February. If successful
here, the Generals could boost their
record to 9-1 going into the William
and Mary event, and regardless of
the outcome the Washington and
Lee swim team is on their way to
their best record in years.

The team is young and Coach
Stearns is proud of their efforts so
far, and though he likes to take the
meets “just one at a time,” Stearns
is looking forward to strong finishes
in the VCAA, the CAC, and the
state championships.

If the swimming Generals keep
up their team effort, times keep com-
ing down, and the attitude of en-
thusiasm continues to prevail, Co
Captains Aven Sharp and Alan
Corwith will find themselves head-
ing a tough and winning squad,

Two Finish NC Marathon,
Qualify For Boston Meet

By JIMMY BAIRD

The Durham-Raleigh Marathon is
one of those grueling twenty-six
mile races which attract those
people hardy or foolish enough to
try to run that distance. Last Satur-
day, for a unique birthday present,
Mike Burns decided to give him-
self a run in this annual event.
With him was another Washington
and Lee student, Doug McNeel. The
two track men left Friday afternoon
and spent the night at North Caro-
line State. The next morning they
joined a crowd of 32 runners at the
Duke University Chapel in Durham.

When the gun sounded, both Mike
and Doug had one goal in mind—

s+, AND THAT MEANS
You, Too!

   

 

 

they wanted to qualify to run in
the Boston Marathon. To be able
to enter this prestigious distance

event, though, was going to require
a time of 34e hours or less, Burns
was aiming at just under 3 hours,
while his running mate, MeNeel,
was going for just under 34% hours
The pair were successful in their
efforts. Mike finished at the North
Carolina State track in Raleigh in
eleventh place, covering the 26,22
mile distance in 2:58, McNell finish-
ed seventeenth with a time of 3
hours, 25 minutes,

Mike and Doug were pleased with
their performances overall, but
Mike was a little disappointed at
not having finished in the top ten,
The finishers in that category all
received gift certificates. However,
considering the caliber of competi
tion (two of this year’s Olympic
runners participated) there is no
doubt that the two runners did an
outstanding job. Doug MeNeel plans
to go to Boston in April to run
there but Mike Burns is still unsure.
He said when he finished his race
in Raleigh he was sure he would
never run another marathon. H¢ +as
recovered to some extent, ble. the
decision is still up in the air. Which
he decides, best of luck
him. As for Doug, see
you in Boston.

aches. Although the building is now
in the Univ. of Virginia Civil War
Museum, the sawed-off shotgun
which was used in finally swaying
the reluctant Lee to take the post
is in storage in the basement of
Lee Chapel.

THE MISSING CORNERSTONE
OF THE LEXINGTON COURT-
HOUSE: Because it is hidden be-
hind other buildings and faces away
from the street, this is not a famous
sight here in Lexington. In 1897,
when the court house was being
built, it was discovered that the
beautiful engraved cornerstone was
missing. To this day, no one knows
the whereabouts of the expensive
piece of masonry, although some
claim the town treasury couldn't
afford one so they trumped up the
mysterious disappearance story for
the benefit of tourists. Note: (Any
contribution to the Courthouse
Building Fund will be accepted with
much gratitude.)

THE SITE OF THE FAMOUS
BLACKSMITHS CONTEST: — In
1884, two prominent and well-re-
spected blacksmiths decided to settle
the argument as to who was the
better craftsman, A contest was
arranged and a date set. The ob-
ject was to see which smithy could
forge the greatest number of horse-
shoes in one hour. The winner
would undoubtedly enjoy a renewed
business while the loser would be
faced with bankruptcy in a few
short months, The competition was
fierce. The hammers crashed, the
tawny sinews bulged, the red glow-
ing metal was rapidly shaped and
thrown into water to hiss itself to
coolness. At the end of the hour the
final tally was taken but it rpally
made no difference. Both smithys
had been dead for about twenty
minutes of massive coronary al-
tacks. They were buried in a plain
service and another blacksmith was
sent for from Chambersburg.

MacDONALD'S FORT MONUL-

MENT: Angus MacDonald, a pio-
neer who settled in Lexington, was

the first and only man to defend
the fort that was, in reality, the
original site of the Yown. During
the early years, Indian attacks were
frequent and the townspeople erect-
ed stout walls and a thick door
to ward off these attackers. One day
though, they all locked themselves
out and realizing their vulnerability,
scurried to the woods to hide, Mac-
Donald, who had been napping
inside awoke in time to find him-
self alone and the sole defender
against a fresh attack. Although he
repulsed five attacks he was finally
overcome by gunpowder, (actually
he stubbed his cigar out on a keg
of black powder), and succumbed,
The grateful townspeople erected a
monument on the crater in the
center of the town square. The
monument is no longer there as it
was torn down to make room for
Mack’s Discount Department Store.

THE MUSEUM OF HUNCH-
BACK MEMORABLIA;: Located
just a short distance out of town,
this quaint collection of photographs
and relics gives us the true flavor
of the prominent hunchbacks of
Lexington throughout the town’s
existence. There for inspection are
former Mayor J, Lane Freeman's
complete set of tailor-made gabar-
dines and Selectman Thorton Kilm-
er’s 2 foot-long ties. Of special
interest is the custom-molded bath-
tub of popular resturanteur Rew
S. Wertie, complete with Art Deco
mother-of-pearl inlays.

So whenever you feel down in
the dumps, leave your apartment
and go searching for the myriad of
fantastic sights that await you here
in Lexington. You will be hand-
somely rewarded for your trouble
and endlessly entertained, If you
still feel down in the dumps, there
is nothing that can be done for
you as the Electro-Therapy Genera-
tor Clinic that closed down in the
early 30's due to the inadvertant
crisping of a VMI cadet has been
torn down and the machinery
scrapped and sold to the Japanese
to be used in their traditional
“Harbor of the Pearls” celebration.

breakaways, knowing that any
minute their socks may fall. Some
players have resorted to tapping
their socks up. In this age of Pete
Maravich style non-conformity it
seems as if the athletic department
has taken wp the banner and pushed
the Floppy-Sock Movement a giant
step forward, Who could have guess-
ed that the Washington and Lee
athletic department would be such
a bastion of the new liberlism.,

Despite these heavy handicaps,
that the frosh are forced to over-
come, they have performed well.
John Rice, a 62" forward, has
reportedly been running with the
varsity in practice lately. Guard
John Podgajny was also playing
with the varsity until he was side-
lined by a knee operation in Decem-
ber. Both these players are making
excellent contributions to the fresh-
man team. Since the varsity will
lose three senior guards to gradua-
tion next year, it seems that Hal
Wellford and Paul Maloney, who
play the point guards on the fresh-
man team, Pogajny (Pod) and swing-
man Bo Poats will all have ex-
cellent opportunities to give WAL
replacements for the departing play-
ers.

The freshmen like to run, and to

we've already mentioned the prin-
cipal runners, John Rice, Jeff Baum,

deserve mention. Walker was un-
able to play Monday night. Again
Poats is a member of this crew.
The 64° Thomson is singled out
here for several outstanding outlet
passes he threw to start breaks.
Thomson is not the fastest player
on the floor, but if he keeps throw-
ing those passes and his jumping
comes along he may only have to
wait for the rest of the team to
return to play defense.

These freshmen should fill the big
gap at guard for the Varsity Gen-
erals next year and provide front

EC Reviews Independent Exams

made during the course of exams
week, and most admitted that they
knew that such judgments could be
considered possible honor violations.

A majority of students polled felt
that the reading day before exams
week fould be helpful.

In other business discussed at
Monday's meeting, the EC tabled a
motion stating that a reporter or
reporters representing the student
media should be allowed to attend
faculty meetings to report to the
student body the contents of the
meetings. Currently, faculty meet-
ings are closed to the student body.
and any action taken at the meet-
ings can only be related to the
student body second-hand through
administration sources,

Law School representative Jeff
Twardy spoke in favor of reporters
being allowed to attend the meet-
ings. Although the minutes of the
meetings are read at monthly ses-
sions of the University Council, any
motions passed or other actions
taken at the faculty meetings become
known to the students after the fact,
Twardy said, He also said any action
taken by the UC on the faculty's
resolutions would just be a “rubber
stamping” of the resolutions, That
the faculty had already passed a
certain proposal would influence the
UC to adopt a similar view of that
motion and likewise pass it.

Twardy also stated the presence
of a reporter probably wouldn't
impede the faculty at the meetings.

Dr. Milton Colvin, who was pres-
ent at the EC meeting, was asked

sociation; President Robert E. Lee
Associates,

Charles McDowell, speaking after
the ODK ceremonies, emphasized
two points concerning the 1972
election. First, that the Democrats
this past year managed something
historical—they rose above their
own constituency. Secondly, that
despite winning one of the greatest
landslide elections in history, the
Republican Party managed to come
out of the election weaker than
before it went into the election.

By rising above their own con-
stituency, the Democrats have again
to learn about the importance of a
coalition. The Democrats are losing
the traditional strength of the party
—the working class, “Archie Bunk-
erism cannot be ignored” in the
words of McDowell. The Demo-
cratic Party is progressive, but must
avoid the danger of abondoning the
people they are suppose to be
representing.

Finally, McDowell gave a warn-
ing to the new members of ODK.
Citing the purpose of ODK to en-
courage leadership, he advised the
new members to guard against the
danger of elitism and to “heware
of themselves.” In concluding, Me-
Dowell encouraged leaders to man
tain their principles and at the same
time not to forget to be responsible
to their electorate, passionate to the
problems of the electorate, and
hopeful by appealing to the best
in all of us.

his views on the matter. “I'd be
dead set against it,” he replied. He
said that much confidential material
concerning students is discussed at
the meetings, and that general
knowledge of such material could
be “embarrassing” to a student.

The possibility that a summary of
the meeting could be given to the
media after a faculty meeting was
also discussed, but the matter was
tabled for discussion after the next
UC meeting. The topic will be
brought up for consideration by the
12 students and 12 faculty members
of the UC.

Also at the meeting, Johnny Mor-
rison, representing SABU, said there
had been a “misunderstanding on
both sides” regarding SABU’s re-
quest last week for a $5000 budget.
He said SABU will come back next
Monday to the EC to present a
revised budget which would include
money primarily for “business
work.” He said the budget would
be no more than $1000.

Black recruitment was also dis-
cussed at the meeting. Morrison and
Dr, Colvin both presented to the EC
the idea of using black students al-

ready at W&L to recruit other
blacks,
Colvin said that such a system

has been employed at both Dart-
mouth and Yale with a high de-
gree of success. He said black en-
rollment at Dartmouth has increased
over 300 percent and that the black
enrollment at Yale has also in-
creased significantly. Blacks recruit-
ing blacks, Colvin said, seems to
be “the most effective way” of
recruiting in this instance. “A case
can be made to give blacks financial
support to go back to their high
schools to recruit,” he said,

Morrison said SABU has been
trying to get funds from the ad-
missions office for such a program
of recruitment, but admissions is
already in the red, according to
administration officials.

The EC decided that Brennan
would go talk to Dean James Far-
rar and President Robert E, R.
Huntley about the problem of al-
locating money to SABU for re-
cruitment before continuing discus-
sion on the matter.

and a full-court press. The Generals
grabbed eight straight points cul-
ting the lead to five, but the waning
clock and a number of foul shots
doomed the effort.

In the 11 point defeat, Lichtfuss
again collected 24 points, 18 com-
ing in the second half of play.
However, Rollins countered his pro-
ficiency with the placing of five
players in double figures.

The loss drags the season's tally
to 7-8, and places increasing pres-
sure upon the ability of this year’s
team to escape the persistant, nag-
ging drought of adequate field goal
shooting. One suspects that a good
night from the floor would go a
long way in adding offensive con-
fidence to complement the team’s
more than passable defensive abili-
ties.

At any rate, the next game in
a series of home contests takes
place tonight. The high-riding foe
is Madison College, a growing pro-
gram with a_ successful season
underway. Surely, a game of the
kind played against ODU is in order
for a reversal of current woes,
