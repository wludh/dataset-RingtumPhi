Approximately 200 alumni will
return to the Washington and Lee
campus this weekend for W&L’s
annual Homecoming festivities.

A variety of activities for both
students and faculty alike have been
scheduled for the weekend.

The J. Geils Band will perform
in Doremus Gym Saturday night.
The band, which was the hit at-
traction at the Pocono Festival this
summer, features music which its
lead vocalist, Peter Wolf, describes
as “primitive Funk.”

Jody ROCK, said of
the J. Geils Band, “No desription
does full justice to what they've
accomplished: a unique synthesis of
the most powerful sounds of the
lasi 20 from R&B to high-
period rock and roll to Chicago
blues to Motown to Memphis to
mid-60's rock.”

The J. Geils Band
albums, “The J. Geils
“The Morning After.”

The concert will begin at 8 p.m.
Saturday. Dance Plan subscribers
and their dates will be admitted free
to the concert. Tickets will be five
dollars per person, Alumni couples
will be admitted for five dollars per
couple.

On Saturday afternoon, the Wash-
ington and Lee football Generals
will host Sewanee in a contest at
Wilson Field, beginning at 2 p.m.
A homecoming queen will be crown-
ed at halftime, and will be chosen
from candidates representing vari-
ous fraternities and other campus
organizations. In other weekend
sports activities, W&L will face VMI
Friday at 3 p.m. in a soccer match
on VMI's field.

Alumni are invited to participate
in a discussion Saturday beginning
at 11 am. in Lee Chapel on “The
University’s Future.” Participating
in the discussion will be President
Robert E. R. Huntley, the three
academic deans of the university,
Drs. William Watt and Edward At-
wood and Dean Roy Steinheimer
of the School of Law, Robert
Brennan, president of the EC, and
Dr. Sidney Coulling, chairman of
the faculty commitiee on alumni

Poetry Readings

Are Started As
Weekly Series

A new series of weekly poetry
reading has begun under the auspices
of Ariel, the student literary maga-
zine. They are scheduled to take
place every Thursday at 8 p.m. in
the library of the University Center
library.

According to senior Scott Rieger,
who heads up the program, anyone
interested in reading is invited to
participate, including W&L and VMI
students, faculty members, girls
from other schools, or townspeople.

“We're hoping the program will
become self-generating,” said Rieger,
We don't plan to be particularly
structured, and we want people to

feel free either to read their own
work of present poetry by some
other artist which they'd like to
share.”

Those who want to read are asked
to call either Rieger or Ariel editor
Bob Wilson at 463-5727 or to leave
a message in the Ariel mailbox in
Payne Hall.

The “Poems” series is part of a
projected expansion in artistic offer-
ings to be generated this year by
Ariel. Editor Bob Wilson is cur-
rently working on plans for a pro-
jected art sketchbook, a phonograph

record, and various exhibits and
lectures, to be produced by W&L
students and sponsored by Ariel.

“Our purpose is to provide as many
outlets as possible for students to
express their creative talents and
imaginations,” he said,

Wilson also announced that Eng-
lish professor Steve Goodwin and
recent graduate David Olson will
read from their novels in the WA&l
bookstore at & p.m. on November
9. The event had been postponed
from earlier in the yeat

OUTLOOK and REVIEW

October 25, 1972

Once And Future Rotc

Only God and maybe Richard Nixon know where Henry
Kissinger is at this moment, though, to be sure, he is some-
where busily taking all the wind out of George MeGovern’s
Presidential sails. The ubiquitous Mr. Kissinger, straight
from an absolutely stunning fold-out in this month’s National
Lampoon, was last heard fulminating over his frustrations
at the hands of Nguyen Van Thieu: “I have succeeded in
Peking, in Moscow, and in Paris—I’m certainly not going to be
stopped in Saigon.” True grit.

 

So, the name of the game is: preemption, And Senator Me-
Govern, the man who made his name by constantly reintro-
ducing the same anti-war amendment year after year (only to
have it shot down by Congressional anti-aircraft fire) has lost
his issue, He can no longer get anyone excited over Vietnam,

McGovern has, therefore, been preempted, i.e., had the rug
pulled out from under him, The draft is no longer a threat to
Our Best Young Men; except for a few sharp exchanges on
the amnesty issue, all’s quiet on the protest front.

Nevertheless, the remembrance of Cambodia and Kent
State seems all too vivid. It was but a mere two years ago
when we experienced our own campus conniptions. And with
this in mind, it seems so curious to note that, last week,

Washington and Lee decided to expand its ROTC program,

Now, in essence, the change is not all that alarming. The
faculty merely okayed a request from the military science de-
partment to allow any student from any other college or uni-
versity in the region that has no ROTC program of its own to
take courses here in military science.

Credits earned here would be transferred to the student's
“home college,” as under the Eight-College Exchange pro-
gram, and he would be eligible for the full range of benefits
concomitant with ROTC enrollment (allowances, scholar-
ships, ete.).

We don't see anything particularly wrong in inviting out-
siders to come join us in our soldiering. But it does strike us
as somewhat odd, when it seems that only yesterday ROTC
was the target of vilification all over the country and student
arsonists were razing ROTC buildings here, there and
everywhere.

But as Holmes said to Watson, “Now it’s all beginning to
make sense.” The tremendous nationwide army ad campaign
and the anxiety on the part of ROTC officials to expand their
rolls spells real trouble for ROTC,

One of the President's selling points, when fighting for
an all-volunteer force, was that intelligent, well-educated of-
ficers could be recruited through campus ROTC programs,
when lured by sufficient pay and benefits. But can they?

Most campuses who lost their ROTC unit in 1970 haven't
restored them ; those that still have them seem to be suffering
from dwindling interest. The irony of it is that, if indeed
ROTC is slowly dying, it is meeting, not a violent death at the
hands of activists, but a whimpering death at the hands of the
President's own policies,

N.E.P.

Campaign Spending

\ brief word of thanks is due the Executive Committee for
sparing us all from a barrage of those hideous campaign pos-
ters during the recent Freshman elections. We congratulate
the winners as well, and sincerely hope the class president and
vice-president find something to do during the coming year.

The EC managed to squelch effectively the widespread
use of such posters by imposing a strict spending limit on the
candidates, In a university our size, the need for this type of
political publicity has always been questionable, There most
certainly is never anything more unsightly than to have the
Apollonian serenity of our Colonnade obliterated by hundreds
of rainbow flyers,

Now, if only the same could be done for spending in the
current Presidential campaign. What if Poor Richard and Sir
George could be limited to only $8.50 each? Sheer bliss.

Films In Review

‘Macbeth’ Is Stark And Cruel

By JESS REEVES
Macheth
A Playboy Production
Directed by Roman Polanski

In the last few years the current
cinema has seen a wealth of Shake-
speare remakes, some of which could
easily give the playwright a bad
name. Scofield’s “King Lear” and
Williamson's “Hamlet” are, in turn,
unforgivably desolate and tiringly
gimmicky.

Roman Polanski’s “Macbeth” re-
marakably avoids both these pit-
falls and shows that an old classic
can be brought back to the screen
without being degraded. For those
who need to be convinced of this
fact the Lyric Cinema will present
Macbeth tonight and Thursday
night, October 25-26.

Although Macbeth played by
newcomer Jon Finch and his Lady
turn in acceptable and mechanical
performances respectively, the view-
er’s attention should be directed to-
ward Polanski’s treatment of the
play rather than the acting. The
setting is a barbarous, brutal Scot-
land in an age in which savagery
and harshness were the rule.

Polanski certainly makes the most
of this scene. Blood and gore abound
in gross quantities; the cruelty of
Macbeth’s Scotland is brought to
the screen in all its depravity. Mac-
beth slaughters the king's attendents
as one would slaughter a pig and
meets his end in being drawn and
quartered, The usurper’s head is then

Full House
J. Geils Band “live”
Atlantic SD 7241

Having been exposed to The
Morning After a few months ago,
| approached this album by turn-
ing down the volume control before
actually listening to the record, It
doesn't make much of a difference,
though; these people are LOUD and
that’s the way you've gotta listen
to them. Like the Stones,

Well, they want to be like the
Stones, They've got just as much
raunch as any Jagger could, and
they whip up the audience on this
album enough to make me censure
speculation that if Doremus Gym
Was ever going to be blown out,
Saturday night is a likely time.

These people do have a
chance of becoming

good
Amerika’s

mounted on a pike and raised above
a cheering crowd,

Polanski’s weird sisters, in all their
grossness, have a hypnotic effect
upon Macbeth. The scene of his
return to the lair of the witches is
strange and frightening. He discov-
ers there a multitude of ancient

 

hags, stripped naked, sitting around a
fire in an underground chamber.
This macabre spectacle ends with
the cooing witches forcing a potion
on Maebeth which brings unconsei-
ousness and bizarre visions,
Polanski’s visual effects show
Macbeth's world as a sordid place

ang ‘Live’
answer to the Rolling Stones; they
just need a couple of more years
to build a mystique, Like the Stones,
their albums show little progession
of musical technique, They have a
style—loud and raunchy—and they
stick with it. Within this frame-
work, they are masters,

“Pack Fair and Square” is the
outstanding cut on the first side;
it's introduced on the album as
“Take out your False Tooth Baby
‘cause | want to suck on your Gum.”
and they'd probably do it, too.
“Serves you right to Suffer,” a John
Lee Hooker song, receives a rip-up
rendition on side 2. It's followed by
an unfortunately short “Cruisin’ for
a Love,” which has one of the best
boogie-style breaks I've heard,

If you like your rock loud and
hard, these are the kind of people
you want to listen to, They deliver.
Fven J. J, Matthews might like this
filisky,

out of which very little good could
possibly come. Landscapes are often
bleak wastelands where bright spring
days must be unheard-of,

The ghost at the banquet, far
from being an ephemeral shade of
the night, is all to realistic. At first,
appearing as Banquo looked before
his death, it is quickly transformed
into something half decayed, hav-
ing emerged from the earth, a vision
in which Poe would have revealed.
From this point in the film a once

depressing landscape becomes a
fantastic, horrible nightmare for
Macbeth.

All this may sound as though the
film is simply a study in the grotes-
que and that outside of this there

LETTERS TQ

The Sauna Situation

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

lt seems rather obvious, at this
time, that there never was much
wrong with the W&L sauna baths
and that their closing was nothing
more than an act of fraud by those
gentlemen, who are the ringmasters,
in that well-known side-show called
Doremus Gymnasium, The Ring-
tum Phi published an article con-
cerning the saunas last Thursday
and seven a.m, Tuesday morning,
the heat was flowing in saunas no,
2, 3, and 4 for the first time since
last May. Someone must have read
the article and told Coach Miller
about it,

There are a few changes that
you will notice if you happen to
wander down towards the sauna
facility, Sauna no. | has an out of
order sign on it (probably what
kept the saunas closed so far)—also,
there are copies of new rules for
sauna use posted everywhere you
might turn your head, These new
rules are quite interesting — the
saunas now close at 6 p.m, (11 p.m.
last year seven days a week). On
Saturdays they open at 9 a.m, and
close at noon (noon is the time
when the gym itself usually opens
on Saturday). On Sundays the saunas
are not open at all (the only day
you really need them).

What is the reason for these rule
changes? Why are the saunas open
less than 60 hours a week when
they were open 112 hours a week
last year? Why were the saunas
opened again when the repairs that
supposedly forced their closing are
still not completed?

| am left with only despair and
hope. Despair over the needless
overmunagement of our saunas and

is litthke of interest. Were it not
for the character of Macbeth this
would possibly be true. However,
by the time one witnesses his death
one realizes that the weak political
animal that is Macbeth has been
ensnared by forces he can neither
understand nor control. His consci-
ence and revulsion at his own deed
show that he is not insensitive,

As soldiers cheer while his corpse
is butchered one feels regret at the
death of a man who was entirely
human, realizing that his bloody
crown makes his death inevitable.
The film ends with another young
man being drawn to the lair of the
weird sisters. Thus Macbeth closes,
appropriately enough, not with a
bang but a whimper.

THE EDITOR

hope that this letter will evoke a
response that will free the saunas,

Rules For Laundering

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

Mr. Darryl Carlton in the last
issue introduced us to one of the
greatest pleasures at WAL: “the
laundry run,”

To many of us, this ranks high on
the list alongside of “Roaatripping”
and “All-Nighters,”

Your first mistake, Mr. Carlton,
was that you attempted to do your
laundry at a decent hour, Rule No,
| of the College Students Laundry
Code states: No student shall be
seen doing his laundry between the
hours of 6 am, and 12 midnight,

Secondly, one does net use the
school laundry, More, importantly,
though, one does not even use a
laundry in Lexington,

Rule No, 2 states: No laundering
is to be done within a five-mile
radius of the student's domicile,

Now, you ask, where can | do
my laundry?

A favorite among many WA&L
students is the B-V Coin-Op Laun-
dromat on Magnolia Avenue, just
a short hop from Sem, At 2 a.m. it
offers al the washers and driers a
student could ever desire. There is
also a machine offering five differ-
ent kinds of detergent (all of which
are always available),

Okay, so much for your basic
laundry run. Now for Rule No, 3
Once you get the hang of it, don't
be afraid of making your own varia-
bons,

One tried and true method is to
arrange for a date at Mary Baldwin,
pick her up at 11:59 pm. and,

The Case
For McGovern

By BILL CUNNINGHAM

Contrary to what Mr. Mcllhaney
would have us believe, the Ameri-
can people really do have a choice
on November 7. The difference be-
tween the two presidential candidates
is like night and day,

and honesty. Manipulation, secrecy,
and deceitfulness have become such
an inherent part of the White House,
that it is littke wonder that obvious
corruption involved in the Water-
gate bugging affair has not alarmed
the people.

Until we have as President a man

Senator McGovern’s openness
and sincereity, we can no longer
expect our democratic process to be
taken with much respect. It is
essential for the sake of the country
that credibility be restored to the
White House.

Secondly, our next President
should have an humanitarian con-
cern for the domestic welfare of the
nation, President Nixon said in cam-
paigning in 1968, “I've always
thought this country could run. it-
self domestically, without a Presi-
dent... You need a President for
foreign policy.” It appears obvious

First and most important, our next
President must be a man of decency

ment, etc., we can expect no real
solution in sight to the internal
problems which plague our country.

A third quality which our next
President should have is an instinct
for foreign policy—which comes,
not from experience or knowledge,
but from a “sense of the way the
world is moving.” It has been obvi-
ous in recent years that without
this instinct, a President tends to
become a tool of his military ad-
visors, who supposedly have a bet-
ter insight into foreign affairs.

In contrast to Presidents of re-
cent times, Senator McGovern has
been a public critic of U.S. invol-
ment in Viet Nam since 1963. Until
we have as President a man of
Senator McGovern’s foresight and
frankness in foreign policy, the
United States cannot expect its Chief
Executive to execute foreign policy

 

decisions with a true grasp of in-

ternational realities.

It’s due to these basic qualities of
frankness, sincerity, openness, initi-
ative, and, above all, of decency and
honesty, that George McGocern’s
election is a necessity.

The Case

For Nixon

By PHILIP SPIVEY

Why Nixon? This question never
fails to evoke passionate and em-
bittered responses from both left
and right-wing extremists in America
today. To the Left, the President is
a man of no sincerity who really
isn't interested in the plight of the
American people. To the Right, he
is a man without principle—a man
who has deserted his cause, Both
sides view him as a symbol of
bland mediocrity and shifty poli-
tics,

Yet the President is far ahead of

his Democratic opponent in the

polls, while his American Indepen-
dent opponent shows very little ap-
preciable strength at all. The polls
show more than just the fact that
Nixon is just a choice between three
candidates. They also demonstrate
the belief of most Americans that
he has done a good job as President.

How can this be? The radicals
and reactionaries find it totally il-
logical. Yet, in a sense, this failure
of the people to conform to their
ideas only confirms the extremists’
belief that masses are incapable of
understanding issues or recognizing
qualities of leadership in a candidate.

This elitist view of the American
voter is convenient when applied to
their rationalization that since Nixon
is so blatantly insincere and unprin-
cipled, Americans support him
either because they don't really
understand what George McGovern
or John Schmitz are offering them
or because they are simply too
stupid to realize that Nixon is their
natural enemy.

This reasoning is pitifully dubi-
ous, Considering the flood of in-
formation poured forth daily by the

most Americans are unaware of the
positions and ideologies of McGov-
ern and Schmitz. And it would re-
quire self-rightousness on a mam-
moth scale to accuse sixty million
Americans of blanket stupidity.
Why Nixon? The majority of
voters answer this question on the
basis of observation—not ignorance,
For the past four years, they have
watched the President and felt the
effects of his policies. They have
seen him make mistakes. They have
seen him reject those policies that
caused the mistakes. They have
noted his lack of charisma and have
had the perspicacity to know that

what the extremists call “bland
mediocrity” is really cool, practical
intelligence.

While the Left flails the President
for having allowed the Vietnam
War to continue, the majority of
voters in America are relieved that
their sons and brothers have come

for selling out to Communism, the

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Blue Drops Ist

By TOM ANGELILLO
Washington and Lee’s
Country team was handed its first
defeat of the season this past Satur-
day by Bridgewater College, 22-33.
The loss to the perennially tough
Bridgewater club lowered the Har-
riers record to a fine 7-1.

Cross-

It was an extremely tough loss
for the Blue, as most of the runners
improved dramatically on their pre-
vious best times. As usual, Stu
Nibley finished first in the meet with
a fine time of 26:25 over the five
mile course. Having established a
new school record against Lynch-
burg in the beginning of the month,
Nibley is only 23 seconds away
from the course record.

Jim McMenamin and Mike Burns
finished fifth and eighth respectively,
while Bill Kalal and Tem Washing-
ton closed out W&L’s top five by
placing 9th and 10th.

The Generals next test will be
the VCAA state college meet, held
at Bridgewater's home course. This
meet figures to be a dual between
W&L and Bridgewater once again
for the top honors. Although it will
be tough running on the top op-
ponent’s home course, Coach Miller
feels that Bridgewater will not be
able to concentrate solely on W&L
runners and therefore might be able
to defeat Bridgewater in this return
match,

Success in this return meet will
depend on the Blue’s 2-5 men run-
ning closer to the leaders. Bridge-
water has only five good runners
and the Generals must give those
five a better race.

Psychologically, it may be easier
for the Generals to get “up” than
for Bridgewater.

Friday’s meet will be a big one,
not just because of the recent loss,
but because of the overall high
standard of competition.

 
   

Wahoos Sink Generals:
Water Polo Finishes 2nd

This weekend, Washington and
Lee travelled to Charlottesville for
their second State Water Polo Tour-
nament. In spite of their lack of
publicity, the Blue do have a Water
Polo team, and a very good one.

Led by sophomore captain Dick
Barber, the Blue swimmers went
into the contest as one of the fav-
orites. Starting for the Generals at
tipoff time were Dick Barber, Jim
Howard (Soph.), Alan Corwith (Sr.),
Steve Johnston (Soph.), Bill Tiers
(Fr.), Gary Seldemridge (Fr.), and
Bill Brotherton (Soph.).

WAL, due to their second place
finish last year, drew a bye in the
first round, In most tournaments
this would be a blessing, but in this
case it hurt the Generals in several
ways. First of all, the Blue had but
one game in which to warm up for
the championship. In the second
round, they polished off Virginia
Commonwealth University 28-5. The
game was never close, as the Blue
were obviously the superior team.
VCU, needless to say provided little
preparation for the finale.

WAL met the homestanding Wa-

 

RING-TUM PHI

hoos in the finals, It was a rematch
of last year, and proved to be a
very exciting one indeed. U.Va. won
it with a late, disputed goal by a
score of 8-7,

Dick Barber was the only Gen-
eral to make All-State, his second
year in a row, He was also named
the outstanding player of the Tour-
nament. One reason that W&L had
so few on the All-State squad was
that the judges who determined that
team saw less of the W&L players
than they did of the other teams
competing in the Tournament. U.Va.
put four men on the All-State team.

After Virginia and Washington
and Lee, VMI finished third, VCU
fourth, University of Richmond Sth,
and William and Mary 6th.

Water Polo, a new Olympic sport,
is not an intercollegiate sport. In
spite of this, Coach Stearns has man-
aged to come up with two consecu-
tive winners. Especially since this is
one of the least publicized, and least
understood sports on campus, much
credit must be given to Coach
Stearns, and especially to his swim-
mers for giving W&L one more win-
ning season,

By PAUL CAVALIERE

Wednesday, October 18th, the
Washington and Lee University
Soccer Team played Roanoke Col-
lege to a 2-2 tie. The soccer team
has been without the services of one
of its Tri-Captains, John Buckley,
since the Lynchburg game. John is,
unfortunately, out for the rest of
the season. During a_ pre-season
scrimmage against the University of
Virginia Buckley dislocated his
wrist which refractured a previous
injury. He was in a cast for three
weeks, but, during this time, he
came out to practice and even play-
ed for a short time in a game,

After the cast was taken off and
his wrist X-rayed, it was found that
the navicular bone was broken and
that he would have to have another
cast put on. Consequently, Captain
Buckley, as Coach Joe refers to
him, voluntarily quit the team, John
loves to play soccer but he thought
it would be best for the team and
himself if he quit. As usual grades
are always in the background, and
being a pre-med student, he needs
to spend a lot of time with the
books,

Back to the Roanoke game, Dur-
ing the first half Washington and
Lee played like it was the first day
of practice. The passes were poor,
there was no consistency, and no
anticipation. The field conditions
did not help matters either, It was a
rainy, foggy day and both the field
and the ball were very slippery.
Even though W&L was playing ter-
ribly Roanoke was not playing much
better. They did score with twelve

seconds left in the half,

There was silence at half time,
at the Blue end of the field any-
way and the second half began with
another Roanoke goal. From then
on it was the Generals ballgame.
The Blue kept constant pressure on
the Roanoke goal. Coach Lyles yell-
ed from the sidelines, “Anyone that
doesn’t hustle will sit their can on
the bench for the rest of the game.”
The tide had turned and the Gen-
erals finally had the upper hand,
After this constant pressure the
Roanoke goal was dented not once,
but twice, by the Generals. Both
scores were made by sophomore,
and chief hustler, John Embree.

The game went into overtime
and the result was the same as the
Indiana University game, a frustrat-
ing, heartbreaking tie. This tie did
hurt us and put the Generals virtu-
ally out of the race for the V.LS.A.
(Virginia Intercollegiate Soccer As-
sociation), now trailing Madison
College by a game and a half.

The whole season now boils down
to the Randolph-Macon game this
Wednesday, October 25. Randolph-
Macon is presently rated as the best
team in Virginia, even higher than
U.Va. If the Generals should some-
how knock off the Hornets, the Blue
will be able to go to a State tourna-
ment which pits the best two small
college teams against each other,

According to John Buckley the
season shapes up to be a fairly
good one. “The Generals should
have a 5-3-2 record,” said Captain
John,

Green Terrors Spook Generals

By BILL FLESHER

Washington and Lee’s Generals
saw Western Maryland’s version of
the Frick and Frack act—only the
names were Bricker and Brock-
meyer. The running of Joe Brock-
meyer and the leadership of quarter-
back Mike Bricker combined with
W&L mistakes added up to a 29-7
defeat for the Generals last Satur-
day.

If one had left after the first
quarter he’s have assumed the game
would have been fairly even. Period
number one saw both defenses stop
possible scoring drives. The Generals
drove from their own 20 to Western
Maryland’s 30, but the drive stalled
after a holding penalty, Western
Maryland's lone threat ended when
an Ode Haugan field goal attempt
fell short. The score after one
quarter was 0-0,

The Terrors got the first break
early in the second quarter. They
got the ball on their 48 after a
fine return of a Chappy Conrad
punt. Western Maryland, with
Bricker and Brockmeyer doing most
of the work, then drove fifty-two
yards in 13 plays, with Bricker scor-
ing from the one. Haugan’s kick

gave the Terrors a 7-0 lead with
6:50 left in the half,

Break number two occured five
plays after the enusing kickoff.
W&L’s Tom Van Amburgh fumbl-
ed, and Western Maryland recovered
on the Generals’ 25. They then
drove to the one-foot line, but were
unable to score. They settled for a
Haugan 20-yard field goal, which
gave Western Maryland a 10-0 lead.

Whatever Coach Buck Leslie said
at halftime had an immediate but
not long-lasting effect on the Gen-
erals. After receiving the second-
half kickoff W&L marched sixty-five
yards in 11 plays, with Tom Van
Amburgh going the last two for the
touchdown, The big play in the
drive was a 24 yard pass from Steve
Fluharty to Mark Lane which moved
the ball to the Western Maryland
four, Doug Chase added the point
after, and it was Western Mary-
land 10, W&L 7,

Those were to be all of W&L’s
points, however, as Western Mary-
land took over. A short punt by
Conrad gave Western Maryland the
ball on the Generals’ 31, Four plays
later, Brockmeyer crashed over
from the twelve for a touchdown.

The snap from center on the PAT
attempt was bad, the desperation
pass fell short, and the score was
16-7,

Two plays after the Western
Maryland kickoff, Fluharty had a
pass intercepted on the Generals’
39. Two plays after the pickoff,
Brockmeyer stormed 34 yards for
another score, breaking several
tackles on his way to the end zone.
Only 1:05 had elapsed since Brock-
meyer’s first score. Haugan added
the extra point, and the Generals
suddenly found themselves trailing
23-7.

Leslie then inserted Lewis Powell
at quarterback in an attempt to
get the offensive moving. But it just
wasn't the Generals’ day. Powell had
a pass intercepted early in the fourth
quarter, and the door was shut on
the Generals, Western Maryland
added another touchdown late in the
game on a pass from Bricker to
Mike Yurek, making the final score
Western Maryland 29, Washington
and Lee 7.

Looking back, now, at the first
five games, we see two different
teams have played wearing the same
jerseys. First there is the W&L

 

 

which played Westminster and
Towson State — crisp attack, good
execution, few mistakes, Then there
is the W&L team which played
Centre, Hampden-Sydney, and West-
ern Maryland emotionally down,
sloppy, lethargic. No one can ex-
plain this difference — is it the
pressure of school? The factor of
playing on the road? Fear of the
opponents? No one knows for sure.

 

This week is Homecoming, and
W&L takes on the University of the
South, better known as Sewanee.
Game time is 2:00.

CONTEST WINNERS!!
Steve Greene has won the foot-
ball contest and will receive first
prize of $5.00. The runner-up was

ball contest are Berry Long, $5.00,

The Case For Nixon
(Continued from page 3)

dent has succeeded in meeting our
potential enemies face-to-face and
that a third world war has never
been more remote.

While the Left attacks the Presi-
dent for ignoring the human needs
of poor Americans, the voters notice
that for the first time in twenty
years the government is spending
more on these needs than on de-
fense.

Why Nixon? Perhaps if for no
other reason, Americans support
the President because he has re-

duced the crisis atmosphere of the
60's and has allowed them to re-
gain a sense of control over society
and their own lives. The campaign
charges of corruption have not alt-
ered the fact that Richard Nixon
has restored the people's trust in the
presidency because, unlike the elit-
ists, he trusts the people and their
ability to understand the issues con-
fronting America.

WHY NOT SKI AT STUDENT

RATES?

The STUDENT SKI CARD is
your “youth fare card” to discount
skiing at hundreds of ski areas
throughout North America. Last
year 35,000 college students saved
from $1 to $15 every time they
skied with a Student Ski Card.
Some saved over $80 during the
course of the season!

The Student Ski Card has exclu-
sive features no other card can
duplicate. No other program can
save you money every day you
ski, while bringing you the lowest
possible student discount rate at
all participating areas. In addition
there’s no limitation to the num-
ber of times you use the card, even
at a single area.

HOW IT WORKS:

Simply present your Student Ski
Card along with your college I.D.
at the ticket window of any par-
ticipating ski area . . . then start
saving money. There’s no age limit
and the Ski Card is good every
day, all season. Open to college,
technical, professional and gradu-
ate school students,

NO AGE LIMIT, GOOD EVERY
DAY, ALL SEASON. DON’T
WAIT! MAIL TODAY!

as you

Mr. Carlton,
laundering definitely has its merits,
and, unless you make up your mind
to mend your ways and come out of
your shell, you'll be relegated to a
“Wisk-in-your-Wash” and
“Ring-around-the-Collar.”

Tim Bookas °74

But the one “run” that’s gotten
the most favorable reaction is the
“Hey-I've-never-done-my-laundry-at-
Virginia-Beach” method. Here you
can combine a laundry run, a road
trip, and a mini-vacation, all in one,
And think of the stories you'll have
to tell,
