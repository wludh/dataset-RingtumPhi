EC Discusses
Final Exams

By JOHN ZINK

At their meeting Monday night
the Executive Committee discussed
the operation of the honor code
during the final exam period, EC
President Bob Brennan said that
any discussion of an exam during
the examination period will be con-
sidered as a possible honor viola-
tion, The statement issued by the
body emphasizes that the Indepen-
dent exam schedule “is a privilege
that is still on a temporary basis.
There's a simple way to insure that
this privilege becomes permanent—
Don't talk about exams.”

Junior representative Mike Brittin
announced that the Athletic Depart-
ment has created a laundry service
for students as part of the gym
facilities. The service is “for the
student’s benefit,” according to Brit-
tin and will cost each subscriber
$22. Anyone interested should con-
tact Coach Miller in Doremus.

Four dollars of the fee is a de-
posit for a laundry bag and will be
returned at the end of the year.
The charge is based on a maximum
of three launderings per week; Brit-
tin said only socks, jocks, towels,
shorts, T-shirts, etc. will be washed,
since sweats triple the drying time.

Clothing will be placed in the
student’s locker after laundering;
checks should be made payable to
the Washington and Lee Athletic
Department.

Suggestions regarding this service
are welcomed,

An envoy from the curriculum
committee, Steve Hilsen, reported
that his group was attempting to
get the faculty to provide more in-
formation on courses than is now
provided in the bulletin. Action is
also being taken to change the
“Pass/Fail” system so that a pro-
fessor would not know which stu-
dents in his class were taking the
P’F option; another reform would
enable students to add or drop the
pass/fail designation later on in the
term. As it now operates, a student
cannot make changes in his P/F
status beyond the first week of the
course,

The EC spent the remainder of
the session answering questions for
a field representative from the Bar-
ron’s Publishing Company, which
puts out a college guidebook.

U.C. Discusses The Arts

The University Council met last
Wednesday night with a report from
an ad hoe fine arts committee and
a discussion about housing for mar-
ried law students. The main issue
on the agenda, proposed autonomy
for the law school was postponed
until next’s month’s meeting.

Dr. George W. Ray, a professor
of English and head of the fine
arts study group, delivered a pre-
liminary report to the Council.
Since the last meeting, he said, the
group had conducted interviews
with Dr, Robert Stewart (Music),
Dr. Gerard Doyon (Art), and Mr.
Lee Kahn (Drama).

Ray said that their study showed
certain inequity in the area of fac-
ulty workload, with the three fine
arts departments coming in third,
fourth, and fifth in the number of
students taught per instructor, He
also read a series of passages
extracted from the 1966 self-study
report, which called for a replace-
ment for the Troubadour Theatre

and more laboratory space for
dramatics,

Professor Doyon said that the
space available to the art depart-
ment was “adequate but poorly
used.” He lamented the fact that

the university's art collection, valued
at some $3 million, was largely
stored in a bank vault; Doyon urged
that a place with suitable parking
facilities be located to display this

Phe course will involve supervised
academic projects, lectures by vari-

and field trips to cultural points
of interest in Japan.

Dr. Rogers expects an enrollment
of about nine students in the course.

According to the professor of re-

during most of the Spring Term
either in Kyoto, the ancient capital
of Japan, or on the island of
Kyushu, the southernmost of Japan's
four main islands.

Cost is the prohibitive factor for
the course, The estimated cost of
the course is $1500. Of this. says
Dr. Rogers, over $1000 goes to air

the establishment of a non-credit
“seif-study” program in spoken
Japanese in the university language
lab. The program would allow stu-
dents in the course to learn funda-
mentals of the language at their
leisure before departing to Japan.

Dr. Rogers encourages students
of all majors to enroll in the course.
“The course can relate to other fields
such as drama, history, and busi-
ness. It's exciting to find such a
diversity of interests in a program
of this kind.”

Dr. Rogers lived in Japan for

four years. He studied at a uni-
versity there for two years and
served as a missionary for two
years. “The experience of living

there has given me a deep com-
mitment to getting people acquaint-
ed with such a different culture, The
experience of living there is the
kind of exposure to a culture that
raises a lot of questions.”

wealth of artifacts. He added that
the present duPont gallery was es-
sentially a “glorified hallway which
cannot guarantee security,” a fact
which deterred many fine art ex-
hibits from coming here.

Ray said that the situation with
music and drama was somewhat
more dire. The drama department
stated their needs as (1) a course
in basic scene design, (2) a theater
history course offered every year
(instead of every other year), (3) a
new man in directing with an
M.F.A., plus (4) one large class-
room.

Music needs were termed as
“critical.” Professor Stewart said
that he and his colleague in the
department were forced to cut down
listening assignments by 20% be-
cause of lack of facilities. He said
at least 250 records in the university
collection needed replacement and
that thievery of records and equip-
ment point up need for some kind
of monitoring system.

Stewart said they would like to
offer the Renaissance and Baroque
courses annually, more in theory
and composition, more in voice in-
struction, more instruments which
students could rent, and a new
faculty member in musicology and
voice.

Dr. Ray said his committee's
initial recommendations are:

(1) a space study of duPont Hall,
to make it a more efficient building.

(2) a home for the university's
art collection, perhaps in Col Alto.

The University Christmas Candle-

feature here in Lexington around
Christmas time. Given right before
the Christmas break at Washing-

of Christmas carols along with the
reading of the Christmas story by
W&L faculty.

When exams were switched to be-

OUTLOOK andREVIEW!
The Universal Side of Education

‘The recent addition of two study abroad courses in Eng-
land and Japan, and the addition last year of a similar program
to East Africa, to Washington and Lee’s meager list of foreign
studies programs may be indicative of a growing change of at-
titude, not only among the hierarchial elements of this univer-
sity, but among Americans in general.

Granted, when Washington and Lee first switched to the
12-12-6 week semester plan in 1970, the idea of a foreign studies
program was probably deeply etched in the minds of propon-
ents of this switch.

We suspect, however, that these people were primarily con-
cerned with the initiation of an extensive foreign language
studies program. After all, what else is there to study in foreign
countries? Doesn't America offer enough educational opportuni-
ties for the individual? Besides a new language, what can a stu-
dent learn abroad that he can’t learn at home?

And, in accordance with this probable train of thought, the
first moves on campus in the area of foreign studies were made
by the foreign language departments. The German Department
responded with German 263, a supervised study in West Ger-
many constructed to give the student an insight into the culture
of the country. Of primary concern in the course, however, was
direct contact with the German language. Certainly the es-
tablishment of such a course was an anomaly to Washington
and Lee’s great tradition of not setting precedents, but it was a
calculated one.

The following year saw the establishment of courses in Spain
and France, both sponsored by the Department of Romance
Languages, and both structured in a manner remarkably simi-
lar to the course in West Germany.

The growth of W&L’s foreign studies program, then, was
developing as probably had been expected. ‘Three courses had
been established in two years, all in the language department.

But now, where was W&L heading in this field of foreign
studies?

The foreign studies program could have followed the course
of some other programs at W&L and reached a standstill in re-
guards to expansion. The situation was ideal. ‘The German,
French, and Spanish programs were all quite predictable. All
these languages offer majors at W&L, and their curricula were
fairly extensive.

But the same could not be said true for Greek, Russian, and
Italian. None of them offered majors in its own right, and none
was extensive, save perhaps for Greek. Study abroad courses in
these language departments were not feasible at all.

‘Thus, with nowhere eles to turn in the language area, W&L
could have stopped expansion of its foreign studies program al-
together. But it did not. Instead, last year, a study abroad pro-
gram sponsored by the Politics Department was approved, and
a course in East Africa was established,

With the establishment of this course in the W&L, curri-
culum, a precedent was set. No longer did the university look to
foreign study as a means only of studying language. A door was
opened to studying all of the components of civilization itself.
Politics, sociology, culture, religion, and many other curricula—
were now possible subjects in which foreign studies courses
could be established.

And so the East African course marked a beginning of a new
attitude at this university, that America is not the only source
of education. Foreign studies courses can direct us from this
American bias to a truer view of our world, And that is what
education is about: not just one side of the story, but all the

 

sides.

The courses to East Africa, England, and Japan, then, mark
a change of attitude both in this university and in’ America,
We hope that this attitude continues to change, and we hope
that the adjective “universal” may soon be substituted for
“American” in describing Washington and Lee's concept ol
education,

And when that happens, this institution will be a university
in a much truer sense of the word,

“It’s a sad, sad case. Our diagnosis shows that this turkey died from being overstuffed with shredded

examinations.”

By SKIP PAUKERT
Editor-in-Chief

These days, when student involve-
ment both in protest and in campus
affairs seems to be ebbing, many
student organizations and commit-
tees are struggling to staff their pro-
jects. We had a letter in these pages
not long ago, for example, from the
chairman of the University Center
Committee, lamenting the fact that
only one student among W&L’'s
1350 undergraduates was interest-
ed enough to apply for a position on
his committee.

What used to be a very prestigious
accomplishment, appointment to a
sub-committee of the EC, is now
largely ignored. Students are turning
inward, to their studies and to their
own off-campus routines, and that
great institution, the extra-curricu-
lar activity, is suffering.

That's why it’s refreshing to hear
of ene such group which is not suf-
fering for recruits and hard-work-
ing hard-thinking staffers. The Stu-
dent Curriculum Committee. which
hasn't been in the limelight since
the major curriculum changes were
made four years ago, is now push-
ing strongly for more reforms and
more changes.

Headed by Chairman Rick Marsh,
the committee has been running its
proposals up to Washington Hall
all year long. While their aggressive-
ness has sometimes forced the Dean
of the College into the position of
“devil's advocate,” still they're hope-
ful that they can leave their mark
with some hard and fast reforms.

Three of the major proposals
which have come out of the commilt-
tee’s weekly meetings this fall are
scheduled to be placed before the
Courses and Degrees Committee to-
day. The changes they hope to im-
plement are these

(1) To make it possible for a stu-
dent to take any elective course on
a pass/fail basis without the know!l-
edge of the professor. “Many stu-
dents believe that their professors
are failing them in a pass /fail course
if they get below a C,” said Marsh.
The committee believes. he said.
that all students, pass/fail or not,
should be graded on the same basis.

(2) To make it possible for a stu-
dent to drop the pass/fail status and
opt for a regular grade until mid-
term

(4) To increase student representa
tion on the Courses and Degrees
Committee. which now consists of
all faculty members except for one
student. “We think we need a direci
line to the Courses and Degrees
Committee, Marsh said

The biggest project they plan to
undertake, however, is the compila

tion, in booklet form, of course de

Curriculum

 

scriptions. The idea is to get each
faculty member to write a few para-
graphs on his course, revealing the
scope of the course and the amount
of reading and work involved.
Marsh says these course descrip-
tions would be “much more detail-
ed” than those found in the univer-
sity catalogue.

“We had originally hoped to pub-
lish a teacher and course evaluation
written by the students,” one com-
mittee member said. They abandon-
ed the idea when they were told that
it would be impossible to compile
an accurate survey. While at least
one member of Courses and De-
grees favored the project many
other faculty members were (un-
derstandably) quite opposed.

Tebo’s Letter Attacked

My Most Venerable Sir:

| too am compelled to write in
response to this, oh so important,
issue of eight-o'clock classes. I re-
spond mainly to Mr. Tebo's response
to Mr. Martin's letter and why I
think it represents an imbalanced
and medically unsound philosophy
of life.

fo begin. Mr. Tebo seems to
think that having endured A-hour
classes somehow places him in a
position of martyr. To my mind,
by his Junior year, if an individual
hasn't been able cartily to schedule
himself around those A-hours, or
tse bribes and/or phone threats to
get them changed, he deserves no
sympathy.

Secondly, although it cans well,
“climbing out of the rack before the
sun does, even while the moon is
high in the sky. and encounter the
hitter-cold of winter” calls to mind
the gamey flavor of a Jack London
novel, or the check-out rules at the
Reykjavik Hilton during their long
winter season. Really, Virginia win-
ters arent that cold ask any
radar operator on the Dew Line

Fhe several paragraphs that fol
low are distressing. Mr. Tebo calls
us to be “realistic” and outlines not
so briefly the rigors of a work-a-day
schedule. The “freeway roller-coaster
jam-up” and the “45-minute-to-an
hour head-start™ fill us with a sense
of dread and impending doom, We
start fevently praying for a replay
of Kafkas “Metamorphosic’ in a
hope of somehow forestalling this

“We just couldn't get enough re-
sponse from the students to make it
worthwhile.” So they will, this year,
try a new approach.

lum Committee

Other campuses, they said, who
had conducted more successful sur-
veys of the faculty utilized comput-
er forms from the Educational Test-
ing Service. But, said Marsh, the cost
for these materials was preclusive.
“We just can't afford 40-50c¢ per
page.”

Dean William J. Watt has heard
most of the proposals and thinks
some may possibly be feasible, pend-
ing discussion and approval by the
Courses and Degrees body. “My
own personal feeling,” he stated, “is
that curricular matters are matters
for faculty decision.” To relinquish

Mr. Tebo says, “Next consider a
special case—the physician.” No,
Mr. Tebo. consider instead the de-
throned royalty-in-hiding. the gig-
golo, the glamourous movie-star
who sleep until noon and waltz till
dawn. They would laugh at A-hour,

no, not even laugh, they would
cackle!!
Your argument that “ihe world

starts early in the day and one has
to do the same to be part of it”
is faulty; ludicrous in fact, for the
world starts at different hours, Mr
febo. yes there are even times
zones that, by my watch, enable
Californians to start their day at
eleven o'clock in the morning!
Finally, your closing rhetorical
question, (calling to mind Socraies’
burning style in the “Apology™), is
somewhat Cyclopsian in scope. Why
bring up the question of afternoon
classes, a subject almost as distaste
ful as A-hour? Students will never
be attentive. Mr. Tebo. God bless
them for it, but they are the only
people who will be living after the
adults have died. Why not pamper
them a bit, what harm would there
be in having say . Classes in bed?

He said the stipulation which re-

Some Tips On Where To Go

A Pre-Season Guide For The WEL Skiier

 

By SKIP PAUKERT

It's getting to be that time of
year again. Washington and Lee stu-
dents who survive the great exam
crunch will go home for Christmas,
and many of them will return in
January laden with new skis, boots,
and bindings.

We've witnessed a veritable ski
boom here at W&L; of course, there
have always been a few northern
interlopers, used to the snows of
Killington or Stowe, but they usu-
ally had to give up their sport for
their four years here. But now the
excitement over Southern skiing,
which began with the opening of
Beech Mountain in North Carolina
a few years back, is spreading
rapidly to Virginia.

There are a few more expert
skiiers at W&L, and a great many
more eager beginners each season.
fhe university now offers P.E. credit
for skiing at the Homestead; and
while reaction to this program has
been decidedly mixed, it certainly
has done a lot to introduce the
sport to brave schussers from Birm
ingham.

Once we return to campus after
Christmas the season will be in full
swing. Already Sugar Mountain in
North Carolina has announced that
they are open with a 4-inch base of
natural snow. Herewith, a capsule
rundown on the major areas within
reasonable driving distance.

By the way, if you want to get
out on the slopes one day, but it
looks warm and sunny in Lexington,
call and find out a report on snow
conditions anyway. All of these areas
have sophisticated snow-making
equipment, so they may have skiing
even when it looks impossible.

The following numbers can be
called toll free, by either dialing
direct or telling the operator on a
pay phone that the number is free.
Either 800-243-3520 or 800-243-
3521 will put you in touch with a
central office that can give you the

word on most of these Eastern areas.

Be wary, however; remember they
want to get you there, and some-

selves have a rental operation. And
it’s strongly recommended that you
start off the morning with a group
lesson; they’re reasonably cheap and
can save even the most intrepid
novices from some nasty injuries, as
well as getting you on the right
track with technique.

times can be a little less than ab-
solutely honest. If the lady says that
condilions at the Homestead, say,
are good to excellent, what she may
mean is that skiing on the Home-
stead’s kiddie slope is good to ex-
cellent. Be sure to ask which slopes
are open and what the conditions
are for each.

Vermont.” Well, being as how it’s
not really anywhere close to being
between Vail and Vermont, still it’s
the most exciting thing to happen
to skiing in the Virginia valley. Lo-
cated just outside of Harrisonburg,
it is brand new this year. Opened
by the Del Webb developers, Massa-
nutien will eventually have some $50
million poured into it to make it
a year-round resort.

This year it will boast four chair-
lifts and a J-bar, with 695 vertical
feet of slopes and trails (vertical
feet is, like it sounds, the vertical
altitude from the bottom of the low-
est slope to the top of the highest;
therefore, the higher the vertical,
the better), The people at Massa-
nutten are heading for a goal of 400
additional vertical and four more
chairs in the future. Prices will be
fairly steep (about $10 on week-
ends) but student rates will be avail-
able. To get there, take I-81 to
Harrisonburg, east on 33 to turn-
off at routes 644 and 646. Phone:
703-289-2711,

Of course, the most popular near-
by ski resort for W&L students has
always been The Homestead, Once
you accept the fact that the Home-
stead is really just a huge country
club with a couple slopes, it's not
that bad. This place generally ap-
peals to the more aristocratic among
us, (their hamburgers are the best
I've found at any ski area, and are
priced expectedly high).

But they have a good ski school
here, and the place is fine for begin-
ners. Just don’t go on weekends;
the crowds are incredible. As for
the more expert, I'm afraid you'd
be rather bored here; not a foot,
last year at least, of any interest-
ing moguls.

The Homestead also has this un-
believeably bad lift system (a trestle
car, they call it) which forces you
to keep taking off and putting back
on your skis with each ride. The
vertical is 500 feet. It’s located in
Hot Springs, Va., to the west. Phone

Just west of Lexington in a coun-
try home overlooking the Blue
Ridge resides W&L Professor Jim
Boatwright. The cottage serves as a
kind of retreat for the English pro-
fessor. It’s time to relax, read, and
compile new material for the Shen-
andoah, W&L’s literary quarterly.

The effort has certainly paid off,
for this fall the board of publishers
of Shenandoah has commended edi-
ior Boatwright for having directed
the magazine to a position of na
tional prominence and recognition,
which led it to be described recently

ment last weekend, will return to
its home mat Wednesday night in
a double dual meet.

The Generals will host Lynchburg
College and Eastern Mennonite, be-
ginning at 7 p.m. in Doremus Gym-
nasium. Admission is free.

Coach John Piper's wrestlers are
1-0 in dual meets following a 57-0
victory over Morris Harvey last
week, The Generals then placed
fourth in the Lebanon Valley Invi-
tational over the weekend.

Individual standouts in the Le-
banon Valley meet were soph Doug
Ford, the runner-up at 167, and
three freshmen who all placed third:
Lee Keck at 118, Dan White at 126
and Jeff Kandle at unlimted.

W&L compiled 29% points to
finish fourth behind first-place Dela-
ware Valley 83, Swarthmore 71%
and host Lebanon Valley 40. Trail-
ing the Generals were Baptist Bible
29, Johns Hopkins 28, Messiah 26,
Ursinus 24 and Scranton 13.

In the Morris-Harvey match,
Goodman, Lewis and Powers all
had pins.

After this Wednesday's dual bout,
the Blue grapplers will take a month
long break. On January 10 they
will take to the road to take on
Western Maryland and Bucknell.

Swimmers Capture Big Wins:
Future Prospects Look Good

By JIMMY BAIRD
and RICH KOCH

Washington and Lee’s defending
conference championship swimming
team has begun a tough twelve
meet schedule with victories over
powerful Old Dominion and Roa-
noke College. Yet to come are such
state powers as the University of
Virginia, William and Mary, and
Virginia Military Institute; the addi-
tion of Davidson, the University of
Richmond, and Seton Hall guaran-
tees that the season should be an
exciling one,

The team lost more fine swimmers
last year than ever before but the
Generals are confident of another
excellent year, Returning are five
conference champions: co-captains
Aven Sharp and Alan Corwith,
junior Steve Erickson, and sopho-
mores Will Brotherton and Jim
Howard, Lettermen Tom Young,
Jon Windle, and Lee Harriss are
also back.

Several top freshmen will help
fill the gaps caused by graduation.
Two Floridians, Rob Searles and
Bill Tiers, are already close to
school records. Bill Cogar is show-
ing his AAU State Championship
form and will be in contention for
All-American honors as a_ diver.
Other freshmen who will see action
are Gary Seldomridge, Alan Petti-
grew, Craig Graham, John Henzel,
Terry McCarley, and Mike Moore.
Breaststroker Richard Koch, diver
Dan Gold, and transfer students Bill
Garten and Steve Thienel round out
the squad,

Prospects for the year look good
with hope for another CAC champ-
ionship high, and perhaps a VCAA
state championship. Several swim-
mers have the potential to qualify
for the NCAA College Division Na-
tional Championship meet at Wayne
State University in Detroit.

The 69-43 win over Old Domin-
ion Saturday opened the home meet
schedule for the Generals. W&L
captured first places in ten of the
fourteen events, paced by diver Bill
Cogar who set school records in the
one-meter and the three-meter div-
ing events. For this effort Bill was
voted the meet’s outstanding per-
former by team members. VMI
swam against ODU concurrently

with W&L, and the Generals were
given a glimpse of a tough opponent
they themselves will face later in
the season.

On Monday the Blue traveled to
Roanoke College to overwhelm the
Maroons 62-31. W&L used this meet
to tune up their swimming per-
formances in anticipation of a diffi-
cult meet on Tuesday with Alle-
gheny College. The Roanoke Col-
lege squad, only in its second year
of existence, was simply no match

B-Ball Beats

 

By JIM MOZINGO

The Washington and Lee basket-
ball team evened its record at 2-2
Monday night with a 92-83 win
over Lynchburg College in Doremus
gym. W&L’s two losses came at the
end of last week. They lost a tough
game to Randolph-Macon on Thurs-
day, and made a valiant effort
against Virginia, especially in the
first half, only to be overcome by
the Top 20 Cavaliers.

Last week W&L fans were treat-
ed to the varsity debuts of no less
than five new talents. Seeing signi-
ficant floor time were forwards Guy
Kerr, Gary Fitzgerald, Bo Williams,
Greg Crogham and center Norm
Kristoff. Especially impressive has
been the play of sophomore Kerr.
He kept W&L in the ball game
against Johnstown in the opener and
his floor play and shooting have been
good in all four games. Kristoff,
Fitzgerald, and Williams have seen
action in all four games, while
Croghan made his appearance in the
opener. These men in addition to
our four strong guards, Clelan,
Smith, Strain, and Porath, give the
Generals a strong and flexible
bench, which Coach Verne Can-
field has used well so far.

Statistics up through the Virginia
game show Doug Clelan leading the
team in assists with 18, followed by
Charlie Strain with 13, Paul Me-
Clure and Skip Litchfuss tied in
rebounding with 27 each, an aver-

for Washington and Lee talent as
the Generals swept all but two of
the events.

Following the Allegheny meet the
swim team breaks for exams and
Christmas vacation. A number of
the team members will spend the
holidays in Florida, participating in
the annual Ft. Lauderdale Swim-
ming Coaches Forum, The next
scheduled meet is with the Uni-
versity of Virginia at Charlottes-
ville on January 5th.

Lynchburg:

Take On Tigers Tonight

age of nine a game, and Lichtfuss
leading the team in scoring with an
average of 21.3 ppg. The Generals
are not shooting well yet this year.
They have compiled a 34.5% shoot-
ing percentage from the field, are
shooting an even 60% from the
foul line,

As we guessed last week, floor
play has been a bit sloppy, but a
reasonably young team this early
in the season its to be expected.
The Generals don’t yet seem to be
playing at peak potential. They put
on a stirring first half perform-
ance at Virginia in the game Satur-
day night, while doing their best
to give away the opener in the clos-
ing minutes to a reasonably inept
Johnstown team. W&L has to get
its cohesiveness together to make it
a winning season and to have a
chance to repeat as at least co-
holders of the CAC title. This is
a coming, team but will it get
here before it’s too late?

WAL plays tough Hampden-Syd-
ney away Wednesday night. The
ligers are led by Reid Kelly who is
averaging 24 ppg. This should be
a stern test for a W&L team which
is playing good defense, generally,
but is having trouble putting the ball
in the basket. So if you can't see
the Generals before the Invitational
here in January, or in Mobile at
the Holiday Tournament on Decem-
ber 29 and 30, you may not
recognize them.

“Biff Barf’s” Sports Spotlights

By PALMER TRICE

Washington and Lee has much to
be proud of in their 1972 sports

program. The Blue booters (who
don’t like to be called that because
it seems to imply that they kick
with their toes, and not with their
insteps, but will be called that any-
way) had an excellent season. Their
narrow 1-0 loss to Madison was the
only thing that stood between the
Blue and the NCAA tournament.
W&L soccer found a real spirit this
year, a winning one. For a change,
spectators lined the sidelines. It was
a good year for the booters. Next
year should be even better.
* OK *

Cross-country had its best year in

recent memory. The Blue were led

by the dedicated Stu Nibley, and
supported by a perfect mix of vet-
erans and frosh. The harriers car-
ried a 9-1 record in dual meets, won
the CAC, finished second in the state
meet, and participated in the NCAA
College Division Meet. As with
soccer, next year should be even
better, as most of the runners will
be coming back.
* * *

Certainly the football season as
a whole was disappointing, but it
had its highlights. Tom Van Am-
burgh averaged 91 yards a game,
and was the closest thing that W&L
has had to a real running threat in
a while. Van Amburgh was the only
General named to the first team on
the all-VCAA team. Second team

honors went to Steve Fluharty,
Chappy Conrad, Bob Brand, Don
Eavenson, and Marshall Washburn.
Mike Britten, Rick Kulp, Tim Haley,
Jim Farrar, and Ed Kowal gained
honorable mention. Conrad’s punt-
ing was the closest any General
came to stardom. For the year he
averaged 40.6 yards per punt,
Could he kick in the big leagues?
* - *

Last week new Lacrosse coach
Jack Emmer took off recruiting.
Emmer traveled to Baltimore, Phil-
adelphia, and then on to his old
hunting grounds on Long Island.
Prospects for this year’s team look
very good. Coach Emmer seems to
have developed a rapport with his

To the Editor

(Continued from page 2)

Yet these relics of antedeluvian
craftmanship, that the coaching staff
has the audacity to call Gymnastic
equipment, continue to blemish an
otherwise model gymnasium, A new
set of stillrings, parallel bars, a side-
horse, and a high bar is compara-
tively durable and inexpensive.

There is no excuse; no justification
for such a flagrant misdirection of
funds and miscarriage of priorities.
If this college cannot purchase
equipment that is safe and which,
at least, lends minimal credit to the
developments of the modern age let
us at least terminate the cause of
loathesome embarrassment and de-
spicableness by trading those emb-
lems of pre-industrialism that now
befoul the elegance of Doremus

Last year, Beech, like Bryce, was
talking about closing to the public
on weekends. Sugar boasts some 150
more vertical feet than its neighbor,
with 1,000 ft. total. Between the
two, you can have some excellent
variety, both in scenery and diffi-
culty,

Rappahannock, near Washington,
Va., is liable to be swarming with
D.C. people. But they've made some
great strides over the summer, add-
ing a new chairlift for skiing the
difficult upper face with another ma-
jor chair and a smaller one as well.
The vertical is 650 feet, and night
skiing (lighted) is offered. Phone:
703-675-3316.

Finally, for those of you too good
for all of this, a trip to Blue Knob
in Pennsylvania might be in order.
With some 1,000 vertical feet, Blue
Knob has always had the reputa-
tion for being the most challenging
skiing south of New England, The
facilities and buildings are rather
dingy; however, lift fees are still $9

a less urbanized atmosphere for the
students to work in, even though
they would be living either in Kuma-

Basketball season is here again.
Coach Canfield promises that he will
have “another winner.” The Gen-
erals this year will run more than
last, and play tough defense. They
should prove interesting. In his
efforts to make W&L basketball big
time, Coach Verne Canfield took his
Blue team to the very unfriendly
confines of University Hail in
Charlottesville. Due to a decision by
Virginia Athletic Director Gene
Corrigan, there were very few
tickets to be distributed on the W&L
campus. For those fifteen to twenty
W&L gentlemen who scalped their
way into the contest, it proved to
be just that. For nineteen minutes,
the lightly touted Blue stayed in the
game. They grabbed an early five
point lead, and managed to hold
onto the lead for almost nine

minutes of the game. Those of us
who managed to get in were more
than glad that we had,

Curriculum Committee
Proposes Reforms

(Continued from Page 2)
share this opinion.

Whether these curriculum com-
mittee proposals will eventually
translate into real results is yet to
be decided. At this stage, Marsh and
his committee members are going
ahead with consideration of several
new ideas.

First, the group is looking after
the needs of the fine arts depart-
ments. “The administration says we
won't know anything on this issue
until the end of the year,” says
Marsh. At this point they are push-
ing for an experimental theater and
an additional faculty member.

Secondly, they are exploring pos-
sible inequities between  depart-
ments, measuring the number of
teachers vs. the number of majors,
“We want to look into the Physics,
Math, Chemistry, and other depart-
ments, where student-faculty ratio
may be unjustly high.”

There has also been talk about
unlinking the linked courses in the
Commerce School, about providing
the option of dropping to nine hours
in the fall or winter term, with per-
mission of the instructor, and fin-
ally, about encouraging more inter-
departmental courses.

Several committee members are
also pushing for more student say-
so for the hiring and firing of pro-
fessors. “Everything we do has to
result from working through the de-
partments themselves,” Marsh states.
“That's just the way things work
around here.”

Dean Watt points out that on
most committees where student “in-
put” is fully represented, their opi-
nions are not necessarily different
from faculty members, On almost
any issue debated in the University
Council, the sides are not divided
on student-faculty lines.

Nevertheless, Marsh's committee
shows every sign of pushing for
more student involvement in aca-
demic affairs. If anyone can make
the headway, they seem to be the
ones.

The Automatic Rule
(Continued from page 1)

Students may inform the Com-
mittee of extenuating circumstances
involved by writing a letter to the
Committee and leaving it in the
Office of Dean of the College be-
fore the Committee meets.

Any student falling under the
Automatic Rule severes his connec-
tion with the university.

Dean Robert W. McAhren, chair-
man of the Committee, says that
generally, few reinstatements are
made, Any student who is not im-
mediately reinstated may apply for
reinstatement only for a term be-
ginning after the passage of one
calendar year.

Students who fail to achieve the
cumulative average required at the
end of the year for their class will
be on Academic Probation for the
Winter Term.

UC On Married Housing
(Continued from Page 1)
holds two units) should be relocated

by September 1, 1973.

UC representative Ralph Smith
said that he objected to the motion,
on the grounds that “these people
entered into a rental agreement in
good faith.

The motion was defeated unanim-
ously, President Huntley said that
the new married student housing
being constructed in the Liberty
Hall area would hopefully take some
of the pressure off this problem.
Present estimates indicate, according
to his assistant Frank Parsons, that
the new apartments will rent for
approximately $110 to $120 per

month plus all utilities except water,
Huntley said that the new units
would be “somewhat nicer” than
those in Davidson Park.

The next University Council meet-
ing will be held Thursday, January
4 at 7:30 p.m. in the EC room.
