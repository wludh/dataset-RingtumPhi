Ralph H. Smith
Rhodes Scholar

By MIKE CHRISTOVICH

Last December 16 was a good day
for most Washington and Lee stu-
dents, as exams were finished and
most looked forward to a_ long
awaited two-week vacation over the
Christmas holidays. But no one was
happier than Ralph H. “Smitty”
Smith, as it was announced that
Saturday that he was a Rhodes
Scholar, W&L’s third in eight years.

Saturday’s announcement from
New Orleans culminated a_ three
month screening process in which
only thirty-two students from across
the nation are awarded the presti-
gious honor.

Begun in 1904, the Rhodes Schol-
arship Program was set up to unify
English speaking people throughout
the world through education, To-
day’s Rhodes Scholarship candidate
goes through an exhaustive three
stage screening process before only
a select few are finally chosen. This
process begins at the individual
schools where Rhodes Scholarship
committees are set up to determine
which students are qualified for the
award.

At Washington and Lee, Profes-
sors William Jenks, Ramsey Martin,
and Sidney Coulling of the History
Philosophy, and English departments
respectively, make up the Rhodes
selection committee. This year they
received five applications for the
scholarship, but only Smith surviv-
ed the entire screening process,
After interviews at the individual
schools, applications are sent to the
candidate’s home state, where his
record is reviewed and sometimes
eliminated by a state’s Rhodes com-
mittee. However, in Mr, Smith's
case he was chosen with twelve other

Alabamans to compete in Rhodes
competition in Birmingham, Ala-
bama.

Each candidate is interviewed for
about forty minutes by the state
committee and only two are chosen
to advance farther in the scholar-
ship competition. In the interviews
the candidates’ strengths and weak-
nesses are tested by an assortment
of general, but complex questions
posed to them by the Rhodes com-
mittee.

After the state competition, only
Smith and one other Alabaman were
selected for the final district com-
petition in New Orleans. Pitted
against eleven other candidates from
the Gulf States region, Smith sur-
vived the final elimination process
and became the tenth person from
Washington and Lee to win the
scholarship.

Each candidate is allowed three
choices from the twenty-five-college
Oxford University system. Smith
hopes to be placed at either Christ
Church College, St. John's College,
and Corpus Christi College. He
plans to study philosophy, politics,
and economics during his two years
there, in preparation for attending
law school in the United States.

‘Streetcar’ Cast
Is Announced

By DOUG BURTON

It was time, Drama _ professor
Lee Kahn thought, for this Univer-
sity in the South to pay tribute to
the South's greatest dramatist, The
cast for Tennessee William's “A
Streetcar Named Desire” is final,
wnd Kahn is glad the ordeal is over,
At least 47 men and 1S women
iried out for parts during open au-
ditions last week, Kahn's conclusion:
I've got a very strong cast overall.”

Kahn chief hurdle is
overcoming the Brando mystique
hanging in the air ever since Mar-
lon’s memorable 1947 portrayal of
the protagonist, Stanley Kowalski
Scott Rieger, as Stanley, will should
er that burden

Like most of the cast, Rieger is
u veteran player, having appeared
before in “Billy Budd", “The Lower
Depths,” and Macbeth”. Rieger's
Stanley, Kahn said, “will be quieter,
leeper than we usually see him.”

The set being built by O. K
Barnes features a semi-romantic,
vintage 1950 shot of New Orleans
While Rieger makes an end run
around the ghost of Brando, Kahn
will be hard pressed to keep the nos
talgia from blanketing William's
powerfully drawn characters

“It's going to be a terrific prob
lem for us because we have to do
Streetcar as if it were a period piece
lo do it realistically and still give as
1 sav the flavor of the South.”

The EC Monday night passed a
resolution to place class officers on
the Student Control Committee,
abolishing the current method of
appointing committee members.

The evening's debate centered
around a proposal by Bob Brennan
to reorganize the SCC by placing
class officers automatically on the
committee. Many members express-
ed the belief that by doing so, the
quality of the officers would be im-
mediately improved. Bill Merrill,
EC vice president, proposed that
the officers not be automatically
placed on the SCC, but that the
EC urge them to seek a position on
the committee once elected. Mer-
rill said, “There is not a cause and
effect relationship in this matter.”
Merrill suggested that the Brennan
proposal might further weaken the
integrity of the SCC.

Jim Overton, speaking for the pro-
posal, said that he supported the ac-
tion on the grounds that, “since
these people (class officers) are elect-
ed they should be given something
to do.” Another proponent of the
proposal Archer Frierson, suggested
that by automatically placing class
officers on the SCC, the EC would

UC Debates Law School
Situation And Recruitment

The issue of the relationship be-
tween the law school and the under-
graduate school made its way into
the agenda of the University Coun-
cil in a meeting held Thursday.

Also discussed at the meeting was
the problem of recruiting blacks at
WAL. The group discussed the prob-
lem and possible methods of rele-
gating the problem.

The law _ school-undergraduate
school relationship issue, which has
been “blown all out of proportion”
according to EC President Bob
Brennan, was discussed without reso-
lution officially recognizing the
“problem” or offering a concrete
solution to it. The 24 hour session
proved to be more of a sounding
board than anything else, which was
the essential idea of the discussion.
Ideas brought up at the meeting
were assimilated by Jeff Twardy,
head of an EC-appointed commit-
tee studying the relationship be-
tween the two schools, for considera-
tion within that committee.

An effective orientation program
for first year law students was the
major idea brought up at the meet-
ing. The program directed primar-
ily towards law students from col-
leges other than WA&L, would pri-
marily be organized to “relate” the
law students more to the university
as a whole, as it is dominated by
the undergraduate school,

Twardy explained what he saw as
the thoughts of many, if not most,
law students regarding their rela-
tionship to the undergraduate school,
“It is the feeling of many law stu-
dents that they are separate and
apart from the school as a whole

and (most of these students)
desire to remain separate and apart.”
Differences in age and courses of
study between the two student bodies
were cited as prime forces which
separate the two,

Other separating the

ing. Twardy noted that the law
school “is accelerating at a greater
speed than the undergraduate
school,” forming a widening schism
in that sense, Also, the completion
of the new law school was seen as
a force in the future which will sep-
arate the two schools further.

The suggestion of an extensive
orientation program for first year
law students was made by law school
UC member Ted Ritter. He said
the program could possibly “fill law
students in on what's available” on
the W&L campus. He also said the
program could give the law students

fall. Bob Keatley, sophomore repre-
sentative, suggested that because
the class offices were basically social
offices, the placement of class of-
ficers automatically on the SCC
could have the result of having an
all fraternity committee. Keatley
explained that the SCC should have
members from each segment of the
student body.

Rick Gray, striking a “Fraternity

Eric Lee Sisler

Commonwealth's Attorney Eric
Lee Sisler said that the key to the
prosecution will be the testimony of
four state undercover policemen,
officers T. S. Savard, W. B. Taylor,
lr. J. Roseberry and W. H. Fowle.
The four troopers worked in the
Lexingion area for more than a year
as part of a valley-wide investiga-
tion. Sisler gave no indication thai
the prosecution would summon stu-
dent witnesses.

The University administration has
not committed itself on the question
of disciplinary action. The Student
Control Committee, made up en-

tirely of students, will have original
jurisdiction on the matter but can-
not begin an investigation until after
the trials. The committee's actions
are subject to review by the Student
Affairs Committee, made up of stu-
dents and faculty.

OUTLOOK and REVIEW!
A New Job For Class Officers

While Richard Nixon grapples with a disgruntled Congress
over his governmental reorganization plans, W&L’s own stu-
dent body president doesn’t seem to have the same problems.
sob Brennan and his fellow Executive Committeemen this
week pulled their greatest coup since getting a student repre-
sentative into the Board of Trustees’ meetings—they actually
found something for class officers to do,

Starting next year the members of the Student Control Com-
mittee will be, for the first time, elected by the student body.
The committee responsible for all student disciplinary matters
short of honor violation cases will consist of the following: the
president and all three vice-presidents of the Senior class, the
president and vice-president of the three undergraduate classes,
plus the president and vice-president of the Student Bar As-
The Student Control Committee,
therefore, will retain its number of twelve—with the distinct
difference of being a representative, rather than a select group.

Several reasons come to mind for such a consolidation, First,

sociation of the Law School.

it gives those forlorn class officers some responsible function to
keep them off the streets. Second, it protects the Student Con-
trol Committee from a clear and steady drop-off in the number
of students applying each year for EC subcommittee posts.
Now, as long as we have class officers, we'll have somebody to
keep us all in line.

Whether this change will work for the better, we just don't
know—but it seems to be worth the try. Certainly it’s a fact that
the Student Control Committee has been decidedly less active
this year than in the past. Just why is this so? Either (a) this
year's students are, on the whole, considerably more angelic
than usual (highly doubtful, wouldn't you say?) or (b) the Stu-
dent Control Committee is for some reason not able to do its job
effectively. Members of this year's committee have claimed that
they have not felt comfortable prosecuting student misbehavior
precisely because they were appointed, not elected, officials.
Hence, the reason for the change.

Just let's be careful about who we are electing as class presi-
dents from now on. That guy who's planning your grain party
may also be heading up your inquisition.

N.E.P.

On The Recruitment Program

Now is the time, after four years of success and frustration,
to take stock of the university's efforts to recruit underprivi-
ledged students. And first, let us make it clear, we are talking
primarily about black recruitment, for black men have made up
the bulk of this group.

There is a lot of dissatisfaction going around concerning
the plight of the black students who are here now and the fact
that dwindling numbers of black students have been enrolled
each year. This dismay was brought into focus during last
week's University Council Meeting, during which Dean of Ad-
missions James Farrar gave the figures which tell the story.

The recruitment effort reached its zenith in September of
1970, when, out of 36 blacks applying, 24 were accepted, and 15
were enrolled, The following year, about the same number ap-
plied, 19 were accepted, but only four enrolled. In September
of this year, another 29 applied, 16 were accepted, and only three
came,

How can this decline in numbers enrolled be explained?
Johnny Morrison, a junior representing the Student Associa-
tion for Black Unity, blamed the failure on a “lack of knowledge
and experience” in the recruiting program. But if the Student
Recruiting Committee can be faulted at all, it is not for their
lack of industry. They have proved themselves to be one of the
hardest-working groups on this campus,

The big reason W&L is not getting these black students ts,
of course, the competition we receive from other colleges and
universities. Contrary to widespread opinion, admissions stand-
ards have not been arbitrarily lowered for black and underprivi-
ledged applicants. True, SAT board scores are, on the average,
some 100-110 points lower for the recruited students. But the
admissions committee has held to these standardized
tests as a rigid indicator, either for whites or blacks; Dean
Farrar steadfastly maintains that black students are accepted
1 e., their ability to do the work

never

on the same criterion as others, 1
at Washington and Lee,
Naturally, those black students who can do the work here
are going to be courted by the Ivy League and other prestigi-
ous institutions. And this is where W&L has been losing out.
Two suggestions have come out of recent discussion on this
inane. One is that W&L should embark on a remedial five-or-six-
vear program, which would allow us to take underprivileged
students with whom we would not face stiff competition from

schools it has been proposed that a man be

other Secondly,
hired to work in the admissions office solely for recruitment of
underprivileged students,

We object to both of these proposals The first be, in essence,
lowering standards to fill a racial quota, a course which has led
to nothing but alienation and ill feelings on other campuses.
The second idea is undesirable, not only from the standpoint of
having an admissions man catering solely to one group, but
also from the standpoint of cost. Money to pay his salary would
he money taken away from scholarships.

There are things about W&L which should attract the black

student, just as they attract the The location and size,
the quality of instruction, and the curriculum are all aspects

white,

which allow us to compete with any other school,

We must, however, be realistic about both our goals and our

Some Impressions On Returning

To The W&L Country Club

By J. JASON MATTHEWS
Now that we've all returned to
our beloved campus, its austere col-
umnar counterance changed by a
downy mantle of snow, it is both
reasonable and practical to prepare
ourselves, Ahead lies our 12-week
Winter Term and only after Christ-
mas vacation do we truly know how
Napoleon felt on the eve of his re-
treat from Russia, This term, some-
times rumored to have come straight
from the manuals of the Marquis
de Sade, is a long, desolate era in
our school year not once punctu-
ated by holidays or good weather.
Sure, sure the heady excitement
of new teachers and courses is there
at first, but after the first twelve
minutes of class, that quickly dies
away, There is always the chance
of finding the perfect date some
weekend, but there is a better chance
you'll go flaming into oblivion as
your auto careens down some icy
ravine on the way to Lynchburg.
To make the whole bleak term
pass more quickly and less painfully
we have prepared a few notes in the
hope that it will somehow ease
someone's pain somewhere.

State of Mind

This is in itself a truly pivotal
point in maintaining one’s sanity
during the Winter Term. If one does
not have a firm control on his mind
and the oh so zany tricks it can
play, count yourself lost, True, there
is a camp which believes in salva-
tion through disorientation and
which has experimented with sev-
eral methods.

Unfortunately, peyote is not in-
digenous to the Valley, and wear-
ing a gas mask filled with Boone's

Farm Strawberry Hill is not in ac-
cordance with accepted levels of
social behavior. Disorientation, al-
though not bad in itself, is not the
answer here. Salvation is found in
increased lucidity of one’s plight;
the more we understand what the
hell we've gotten ourselves into, the
better we'll be able to cope with it.

A close reading of the major
philosophers who have dealt with
the issue of man’s plight is avail-
able. One a week, in alphbetical
order will do the trick. Starting
with Camus and going through the
Hardy Boys to Pascal will give the
student some idea as to the univer-
sality of his dilemma.

| propose weekly sensitivity ses-
sions, available to everyone who so
desires, whose techniques would in-
clude bunsen burner tactile aware-
ness, an Evans Dining Hall food
whirlpool bath, and a_ three-day
“remedy” sequestration in the cup-
ola above Washington Hall tied to
the bell clapper. In any case, cogni-
zance is the key word here, a goal
for which everyone should strive.

Student Activities

The mug-wumps and stick-in-the-
muds of DUBYANEL many times
indict our fair alma-mater with ac-
custations that it offers little or
nothing to do, student activity wise.
Oh foolish youth! Not true! At al-
most any point around campus an
energetic student can find diversion
and amusement.

This year Mock Convention video-
tape replays are being made avail-
able and a pre-season § screening
promises many stirring montages of
ballons and those cunning straw con-
vention hats, Spelunking forays will

Farrar has said, our best bet to convinee a black student to come

here is to show him the campus and introduce him to students.
Herein lies our greatest selling point,

The EC must keep this in mind as

they consider the Re-

cruitment Committee's proposal for an allocation to provide a

“Recruitment Weekend.”

Black applicants could be brought to
Lexington for a few days in a context much like the

Things to Avoid

As in all euphoric Eldorados,
even though the sheep are covered
by golden wool, they leave behind
things unpleasant to trod upon, So
with the Winter Term. A quick list
of those things which would unduly
upset students is useful. All efforts
should be made to avoid the follow-

ing:

(1) The cheapest item on the
ABC store's liquor list, 70¢ Apple
Run Wine. If you have received a

model train for Christmas though,
this beverage will serve admirably
as a powerful fuel source.

motely affiliated with the Dance
Board, (1 am told that this is un-
fair because the Board's members

you tango cheek to cheek with a
leper?),

he has been told, Emmer knows that
he is inheriting a team with great
potential. This situation is similar to
his first college coaching job at
Cortland. He is taking over a pro-
ven winner and instituting a few
changes that the players will have
to acclimate themselves to. Emmer
knows that some of these changes
will take some time for everyone to
get used to, but he is confident that
through continually good recruiting
the team will definitely be “success-
ful in the long run.”

Emmer, (as his three-year record
of 33-6 proves) is an excellent coach
who will not be afraid to stray from
the path beaten by former coach
Dick Szlasa. “Different human be-
ings will have different philoso-

Emmer (who will be assisted by
Bill McHenry) sees his job as coach
as helping every member of the
squad to reach his potential, which
will enhance the team picture, He
will also “make every member of the
team feel they're contributing, be-

Emmet this view is funda-

Blue lost its first game 82-74 to a
talented Nichols State squad. How-
ever they defeated the host team,
Spring Hill, the next night by a not
so convincing 69-60 score.

The Nichols State team contained
some high classed talent that this
reporter saw in high school, but
were not as impressive as they might
have been, even though freshman
Richard Polk shot the eyes out of it
that night. Polk was a high school
star for three years on an excellent
high school squad that was state
tournament caliber, Polk was voted
to numerous all-tournament teams
his last two years in high school.
His biggest problem seems to be at-
titude and a bad case of underdeve-
loped talent. W&L was rusty coming
off its Christmas lay-over, Timing
was bad or the game might have
been a different story as neither team
played to its potential. The Gen-
erals had been favored by many
local people in the tournament to
whom W&L was an unknown quant-
ity.

The second game against Spring
Hill was a different story. Though
Spring Hill put up a good game,
and the Generals were again unim-
pressive. Spring Hill was definitely
outclassed. At times the game re-
minded me of run-and-shoot free-
for-alls I used to play in at the local
playground, but W&L managed to
control enough of the ballgame, and
steal enough of Spring Hill's errant
passes to counteract their own,

Washington and Lee returned to
Doremus this past Friday and Sat-
urday nights to host its own tourna-
ment. Lebanon Valley defeated
Maryville College and Washington
and Lee defeated Washington Col-
lege to open the tourney on Friday
night, setting up one of the most
exciting finishes New Doremus has
yet seen, between W&L and Leban-
on Valley. The Friday game saw
Gary Fitzgerald come off the bench

a

 

for the first time that weekend to
do it all and spark the Generals to
their opening round victory. But no
individual performance could over-
shadow the Championship game Sat-
urday night with its forty-three min-
utes of enthusiasm. (The last two
minutes, roughly, of overtime were
pretty academic.) The game began
as the scoring did, kinda slow. The
Generals drew first blood when Guy
Kerr connected on a free throw.
For the rest of the game it was nip
and tuck with neither team able to
gain any sizable advantage.

Paul McClure was beginning to
put together his best game of the
season to date as the game wore
on, Paul was not only rebounding
better, playing good tough defense
on a man taller than himself, but his
shooting was the best this year.
Team captain McClure held his team
in contention until he succumbed to
his fifth foul in the last two minutes
of the ball game. Hatton Smith, with
a fine defensive performance, and
Bo Williams, and again Gary Fitz-
gerald came off the bench to lend a
needed hand at some crucial mom-
ents, With W&L on the short end of
the score, and McClure having
fouled out Fitzgerald took a perfect
inbounds pass and scored the bucket
that tied the ballgame. The only un-
usual part of the play was that it
was a Lebanon Valley player who
got the assist. Despite urging from
the crowd the Generals refused to
give the, basket back to Lebanon
Valley and the game remained tied.
There was an exchange of baskets
and the game proceeded into a five
minute overtime, of which the first
three minutes were as tension packed
as the last three of the game.

All of a sudden a 6°3” whirling
mass of basketball talent took the
game by the throat and wrung all
emotion, unless it be sympathy,
from the rest of the game. None of
us who were there will forget the

performance turned in by senior co-
captain Donny Johnson, the man
who purportedly does a 36” stand-
ing jump. Johnson stole a pass with
the score tied, raced the length of
the court, and put the Lebanon Val-
ley crew ahead for the first time in
the overtime period. That was as
close as W&L came after that with
Johnson only needing his teammates
to remain alive for the rest of the
game, which they did a fine job of.
Johnson quietly scored 30 points and
led his team to an 82-79 victory
which left everyone in Doremus
drained. The guy was a one man
army.

As a postscript, Paul McClure is
awarded this week’s Academy
Award for his performance when
elbowed in the eye by Lebanon Val-
ley center Bill Ammons; a tremen-
dous job Paul, These two tourna-
ments noticably lacked freshman
center Norm Kristoff who tore liga-
ments in his ankle just before Christ-

mas. Nobody is quite sure when
Kristoff will be able to return to
action,

In his absence and not necessarily
because of it, another freshman,
Gary Fitzgerald, has become the
most dependable reserve on Coach
Verne Canfield’s front line. The holi-
days may have hurt W&L, especi-
ally because the new players were
just getting their timing down when
the break began, but since that
break meant the absence from books
for a few all too short weeks, Christ-
mas can't be all that bad.

Monday night; the Generals tra-
veled to Bridgewater and came away
with an 80-75 victory. It was one of
W&L’s best games, as they finally
combined their tough defense with
a poised and efficient offense. Coach
Canfield started Bo Williams and
Jerry Porath at the guards, in an
effort to spark his team. They ap-
parently did. With the help of sopho-
more Guy Kerr, they lead the team
to an early 8-0 lead. Coach Canfield
was pleased with the play of his
guards, including Doug Clelan. as
Williams had 12 points, and Clelan
and Porath both had 6. With this
win behind them, the Generals will
look toward Towson State tonight.

will stress is that “no one is to em-
barrass the team” in any way.

When questioned about how he
liked the University, Coach Emmer
had nothing but praise. He stated
that he was impressed by the hospi-
tality shown to him and his wife
throughout the University and went
on to say he has “had no second
thoughts on the move.”

Emmer said he was disturbed by
Cortland’s philosophy of rewarding
credentials rather than good teach-
ing and doesn’t feel that this is the
case at W&L. He said that he was

pleased to be at Washington and
Lee where, he says, the athletic sup-
port of many of the deans is “tre-
mendous.” He said he felt sure that
this was a good sign of spectator
support and that he was looking
forward to large crowds in the
spring.

Coach Emmer went on to say that
he can concentrate on coaching
more here, but that he still enjoys
getting out and working with guys
in phys. ed, classes. He asserted that
he isn’t the type that can sit in an
office all day and, with Washington
and Lee’s non-major phys. ed. pro-
gram and excellent facilities, he
doesn't mind teaching classes at all.

Many of the players have been
optimistic about Coach Emmer and
although there is a general con-
census that rules will be more lax
off the field, practices will be tough-
er than last year,

All-American defenseman and tri-
captain Don Eavenson felt that
Emmer has already built up a “good
rapport” with the players. He also
thinks that Coach Emmer will stress
conditioning more than ever and
that he will make sure that the
squad stays in top shape all season.
Eavenson summed up his feelings on
the coming season by stating that he
thinks Washington and Lee has
“more talent on paper than ever be-
fore” and that Coach Emmer has
brought “a whole new outlook” to
WA&L lacrosse which will insure its
continued success,

(Continued from Page 2)

So if love of murder mysteries is
typically American, I'm a Yankee
Doodle Dandy. And that’s why I
liked the new James Garner flick,
They Only Kill Their Masters,
which arrives at the Lyric Theatre
this week.

They Only Kill Their Masters
is by no means a great film. There
are no innovative camera angles,
no award-winning performances, no
memorable lines (except for a cut-
esy and constant repetition of the
word “neat” by the two principals),

You might even say the film was
Hollywood slick. Which is simply
another way of saying that this is an
unpretentious, thoroughly enjoyable
effort and an example of just what
the American motion picture in-
dustry does best.

They Only Kill Their Masters is
indeed a formula “whodunit.”
James Garner stars as the chief cop
in a small California town, a kind of
souped-up Mayberry R.F.D.—quiet
and shady, but close enough ‘to L.A.
to get all the wiredos passing
through.

The title refers to one Doberman
Pincher named Murphy who, in the
films opening scene, drags ashore
the mutilated body of his master, a
gir! who owned a secluded beach-
houses outside of town,

Immediately the dog is assumed
to have eaten the victim and is im-
pounded in the care of the local
vet (played by Hall Holbrook) and
his assistant (Katherine Ross).

Katherine Ross has very little to
do in the movie except fall in love
with James Garner. But one tremen-
dous virtue of this film is that she’s

out” quickly. He blamed this on a
“lack of knowledge and experience
in recruiting” on behalf of the uni-
versity, and proposed that the ad-
missions department of Washington
and Lee add a black recruiter to its
staff.

Dean James Farrar of admissions
presented facts involving black re-
cruitment to the UC. According to
the Dean, the facts showed that the
basic problem in recruiting blacks
lies in getting the black student here

Philip Booth To Sing

Bass soloist Philip Booth, a 1964
graduate of Washington and Lee,
will return to Lexington next Tues-
day in a Rockbridge Concert-
Theatre Series production.

Booth will perform in Jackson
Memorial Hall at VMI beginning at
8:15 p.m. Included in his program
will be works of Handel, Tchaikov-
sky, and American composer Ned
Roman.

The bass soloist has been singing
professionally for three years. He
has won several major awards in-
cluding a Metropolitan Opera Au-
ditions award and a grant from the
National Opera Institute.

Booth has performed with the
Western Opera Theatre, the Port-
land Opera, San Francisco's Spring
Opera Theatre, and the Baltimore
City Operas. He was also chosen to
perform in the opening _ perfor-

mances in the Kennedy Center of
Handel's Ariodante,

on camera almost as much as he is
—aand she’s still, needless to say,
captivating.

The mystery begins when we find
out that, lo and behold, poor Mur-
phy is not the criminal, but rather
that the young lady was drowned in
her own bathtub by someone very
human. Upon learning this, Sheriff
Garner adopts the dog, along with
Miss Ross, and proceeds to find the
real killer,

To tell more would be, as they
say, spoiling the fun. Suffice it to
say that, during the course of the
last ninety minutes, suspects are in-
terrogated, the inevitable second
murder is committed, and a whole
array of stars contribute some very
creditable performances. Tom Ewell
(talk about faces from the past!)
sits in the courthouse as Garner's
«.dekick, Arthur O’Connell runs the
local greasy spoon joint, and Ed-
mond O'Brien operates the local
liquor store (and looks like he’s
sampled everything twice).

Peter Lawford is his old smooth
self as he zooms down in his sports
car to look into his ex-wife's mur-
der; Holbrook intermittently appears
looking very suspicious; and June
Allyson plays a part in what must
be her first film in a long time.

All of which adds up to a really
exciting and eminently watchable
film, helped along by Lane Slate’s
taut screenplay and careful direction
by James Goldstone. Greatest of all,
the evil-doer is not revealed until the
very end (although any self-respect-
ing sleuth should have it figured out
by then, if he watches closely). For
a fun and diverting evening, They
Only Kill Their Masters is first-rate.
