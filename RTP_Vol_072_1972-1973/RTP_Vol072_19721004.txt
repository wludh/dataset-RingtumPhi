Saturday Night In Doremus

‘Malo’ Opens Dance Board Concert Season

 

Tired of the ho-hum life around campus at W&L? “Malo” will break the monotony Saturday night with a

concert in Doremus Gym,

The Washington and Lee concert
season opens Saturday as “Malo”
will perform at 8 p.m. in Doremus
Gym.

The concert is sponsored by the
University Dance Board and stu-
dents holding Dance Plans may at-
tend the concert without charge, and
they may bring a date, All tickets to
the concert will cost five dollars.

The concert is the first in what
the Dance Board hopes will be an
outstanding series of concerts at
WAL this year, Last year’s Dance
Board concerts featured such _per-
formers as Gordon Lightfoot, Sha-
na-na, and the Chambers Brothers.

Malo’s music rings of Santana,

Honor System Taken for Granted

By WATSON TEBO

In the opening convocation, Presi-
dent Huntley challenged W&L to
maintain its “community of trust.”
The Honor System, or our “com-
munity of mutual trust,” is some-
thing entirely unique to W&L. The
point of my article will be to show
freshmen (and some upperclassmen)
that what we often take for granted
here is something which no other
college campus | know of can offer.

This summer | attended Tulane
University in New Orleans. Nothing
special in itself, but the lack of any
honor system and the complete lack
of any sense of mutual trust among
students, professors, and campus
officials annoyed me. Tulane is, of
course, a much larger school in a
large metropolitan area, but I feel
there could be more mutual trust
than there is.

| shall point out some specifics
such as our library checkout system.
WA&L students can carry in parcels,
knapsacks, and briefcases and carry
them out without fear of being ac-
cused of sneaking out books. At Tu-
lane, there is a guard at the only
exit from the library. He not only
checks all packages and briefcases,

but inspects each individual text to
make sure it is checked out properly.

Many people never give a second
thought to the fact that tests are
never proctored at W&L. In fact,
during final exams I have often left
the room at my leisure to get a Coke
or some fresh air. For many of our
exams, the student is allowed to
choose where he would like to take
it, and he can schedule the time of
the exam himself. Tests at Tulane
are proctored and scheduled for you.
It’s just, too damn bad if the univer-
sity schedules four exams in two
days for you. And don't think it
never happens that way. I heard too
many students at Tulane this sum-
mer bitching about it.

It is a real pleasure to know that
you can browse around the W&L
co-op without automatically being
suspected of shoplifting. At Tulane,
all books and packages must be left
outside the bookstore/co-op. And
if you make the mistake of carrying
a briefcase in with you, the manage-
ment will apprehend you faster than
they would a rapist or murderer.

Something I have noticed in our
co-op has impressed me greatly—of-
ten the crowd gets quite large dur-
ing peak hours, particularly lunch,
and the cash register will not ring
fast enough to handle all the incom-
ing change. | have seen many stu-
simply leave the correct
amount of change for an item they
purchase on the counter and leave
After the crowd clears, you can see
little stacks of coins spread over the

dents

counter being collected by the
cashiers.

At Tulane, it's strictly one-way
toll booths; once you are in, you

cannot leave until you pay, no mat-
ter how busy the co-op might be.

As I have said, our community
at W&L is blessed with a mutual
trust among students and faculty.
Not only are your actions respected,
but your word is honored.

At Tulane, for example, there is
no pledge for a test on paper; they
simply do not trust you. They watch
you while you take a test instead of
taking your word as a gentleman.

This summer. | found what it was
like to not have your word honored.
A special Saturday session for my
class at Tulane was called, so my
friend and | showed up at 7:45 a.m.
dressed in the usual college attire for
summer classes, carrying physics
books, notebooks, and slide rules.
As we entered the science building,
a campus policeman (armed) was
stationed at the security desk. He
requested to see our identification
cards, We explained that we were
attending our physics class, as usual,
except that the professor had called
for a special class that morning. The
guard did not take our word for it,
and again he requested to see our
picture ID cards in order to prove
we were summer students at Tulane.
Again, we attempted to explain that
we were not vandals or arsonists,
and that we only wanted to go to
He still refused to believe us.
We produced our ID cards which

Petitions
Freshman

By JOHN F, ZINK

The Executive Committee covered
a variety of subjects in its regular
meeting on Monday ranging from
reports by the standing committees
and final budget proposals to the
announcement of the up-coming
freshman class elections.

Stan Taylor, Cold Check Com-
mittee chairman, reported that he
had thoroughly explained the pur-
pose of the committee to freshman
during orientation. Ted Blain, also
of the committee, stated that the
committee mow has a reserve of
$460. Taylor said, “We are plann-
ing to visit merchants in town this
week to begin picking up bad
checks.” The EC then heard from
Mark McMinn of the Film Com-
mittee.

McMinn presented a list of about
25 films to be shown during the
year. “This list has been compiled
from the many requests submitted
by students,” McMinn explained.
The list includes old American
classics as well as international pic-
tures. McMinn stated that the film
program cost about 6.2 cents per
student per film.

Dick Marsh of the Curriculum
Committee reported the recent acti-
vities of his group. Marsh explained
that his committee is attempting to
have the Sociology and Music de-
expanded, extend the

nasium, and hopefully the over-
crowding which occurred at con-
certs in the old gym will be a thing
of the past.

dent of this year’s Dance Board,
while Jay Taylor serves as the vice-
president of the organization.

drop/add period, and change the
procedure for obtaining a double

The EC then moved to the final
arguments on the budget proposals
for the '72-'73 year. The committee
finally divided up the $17 campus
tax as follows: Calyx, $5.50; Ring-
tum Phi, $3.18; Expense of Fund,
$.30; EC, $.65; Student Bar, $.45;
Ariel, $1.00; Film Committee $.90;
Reserve Fund, $.3778; Publications
Board Reserve Fund, $.7967; Con-
tact, $3.00; and Law Newspaper,
$.9455,

Lewis Powell, EC secretary, com-
menting on the upcoming freshman
class elections, suggested that pos-
ters be restricted. The EC however,
adopted a stronger proposal limiting
the candidates to $5 and 25 pos-
ters to be placed only in the Fresh-
man Quad and dorms.

Bob Brennan, EC president, an-
nounced that petitions for freshman
class offices and the freshman EC
position are due next Monday in
the EC box by 6 p.m. The elections
will be held on the following Mon-
day. Brennan also stated that a ques-
tion/answer period will be held
Thursday night from 7 to 8 p.m. in
the EC room for all potential can-
didates. Applications for the Admis-
sions, Athletic, Financial Aid, and
Curriculum Committees are due
next Monday night.

 

University Psychologist
Begins His First Year

“My role is to provide an ave-
nue for students to get professional
psychological advice in working out
their personal problems, both the
serious hang-ups and the not so
serious ones.” With this outlook, Dr.
James Worth begins the year as
Washington and Lee's first full-time
psychologist.

Dr. Worth, a native of Dayton,
Ohio, has had intense but broad ex-
perience in the area of mental
health. His arrival on campus this
fall was the culmination of efforts
by the university faculty and admini-
stration to provide a better coun-
seling service for members of the
university community

“| want to stress that the people
who will be coming to see me are
not necessarily those who we de-
fine as ‘mentally ill." Worth insist
ed. In fact, he expects the vast ma-
jority of cases to be students who
have relatively normal types of prob
lems.

“TH be talking with guys about
everything from sexual problems of
anxieties to family pressures from
home. Some may simply want some
advice on making their career
choice.” Worth emphasized he would
be available to
with WAL. including perhaps a stu
dems wife or girlfriend, or a mem-
ber of the faculty or staff

Dr. Worth’s office is located in

the University Center next to the

Fairfax lounge. Whenever his door
is open, Monday through Friday,
anyone may come in and “rap about
their problem.” If the door is closed,
he said, an appointment can be made
with Mrs. Addie Payne, the recep-
tionist behind the University Center
lobby window, or by calling Ext.
299. “In an emergency, I'll be avail-
able day and night.”

Dr. Worth has spent the last three
and a half years as a clinical psy-
chologist in a comprehensive mental
health center at South Bend, In-
diana. There he worked with stu-
dents from Notre Dame and Si
Mary's, as well as consulting with

“| also maintained a private prac-
tice, in which I dealt mainly with
older adolescents and their families,”
Worth added. He anticipates that he
will be teaching at least one, poss-
ibly two, courses here at WA&L.

He received his degrees at Ohio
State, University of Missouri, and
the University of Northern Colo-
rado, where he was trained in school
psychology. He and his wife have
two young children, a boy and a

OUTLOOK andREVIEW|
The Battle For The Arts (Part IT)

Little did we know, when we spied a certain deficiency
of tennis facilities a couple weeks back, that we would thereby
provoke the W&L Muse to rear her head and to proclaim the
neglect of the arts here. Mr. Buch’s well-argued and impas-
sioned article has now been followed by a similar plea from
freshman Ron Harr, who makes the claim (in a letter which
appears elsewhere on the page) that there has been curricular
neglect in the journalism department as well.

The sentiments of both these men obviously are shared by
many other students in their respective fields; both raise im-
portant questions about university priorities. And we endorse
their contention that present facilities are terribly inadequate
to meet present and future student demands.

But we are not convinced that, as was implied in Mr.
Buch’s essay, these inadequacies are due to a pro-jock, anti-
art bias in Washington Hall. As he himself observed, enroll-
ment in these courses of study has increased phenomenally
over the last few years. For this very reason, it is understand-
able why university planners were caught so completely off-
guard.

A major has been conferred in Drama only since 1970. It
is true that the University Theatre cannot provide the class-
room or the workshop space necessary for the present num-
bers. But enrollment in drama courses in 1969-1970 merely
totalled 148 students; it shot up to 205 the following year, and
to 249 last year,

[t is true that classes are grossly overcrowded and listen-
ing facilities overtaxed for the Music curriculum, Yet there
were only 138 men taking music courses in 1969-1970; last
year there were 301, The same, of course, is true for classes in
studio art and art history.

The point of all this is to demonstrate that the need for
a major arts expansion has not been so compelling until quite
recently. When the university determined to fulfill the long-
standing requests for a gymnasium, a new law school facility,
a new undergraduate library and new upperclass dormitories,
they could not have anticipated so fervent an influx of in-
terested students into the arts.

By the same token, numerous journalism students have
complained that their department is understaffed and under-
equipped. Washington and Lee has boasted that it sports the
nation’s only accredited journalism school in a small univer-
sity, they argue, so why is there a strain? Well, perhaps part
of the reason is that there were but seven J-School majors two
years ago. Last year the figure rose to 16, This year there
are 70,

Now Mr. Harr suggests, as well, that, as a prospective
freshman, he was sold on W&L with misleading information,
and this is a different matter entirely. If the administration's
PR apparatus were used to attract music, drama, or journa-
lism students by claiming facilities in these areas which don’t
exist, they would be no better than the gladhanding fraternity
which cannot deliver on the grandiose promises made to fresh-
men during rush, The inevitable result: disillusionment.

The only material, however, that we can find which might
paint an over-rosy picture of what W&L has to offer in these
areas comes in the form of a booklet on Music and Drama
sent out to prospective applicants last year on request, It was
compiled and presented by the department of Music and
Drama itself to recruit interested students.

Finally, we don't mean to pass over the main thrust of
Mr, Buch’s essay, ie., that what we need is a university com-
mitment to the arts if only to justify W&L’s claim to offer a
“liberal arts” education. He calls for a major arts complex to
focus creative endeavors in one physical area,

It is certainly true that, in order to attract good faculty
and good students in the arts, a creditable major must first be
offered, But what he is talking about is integral to the univer-
sity’s conception of what it wants to offer.

Many faculty members lobby just as vigorously that W&L
needs a graduate program in a variety of fields, others say we
need a school of engineering or an architectural program
These involve major changes in the nature of the university
and have been resisted for that reason,

Mr. Buch says we cannot rely on the arbitrary good will
of the administration. We say that we not only cannot but
should not rely on the administartion to abritrarily decide
what W&L is to be

come an arts center, or a graduate school, or a coed institution

whether it is arbitrarily decided to be

These major questions of direction must remain for the whole
university—its students, faculty, administration, and alumni
to determine.

We agree with Mr

strong in the arts, These subjects can no longer be treated as

Buch that W&L can and must become

extra-curricular activities. But just how much emphasis shall

he placed on this is not up to Mi Buch, or to us, but rather to

Letters
To the Editor

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

I was recently impressed by an
article in the last edition entitled
“The Pathetic State of W&L Arts”
by Gregory Buch. What Mr. Buch
had to say about space for the study
of dramatics did not directly bother
me because | have never pursued
the art of drama, but his statements
about the overall attitude towards
creativity and the arts has bothered
me since my arrival here this fall.

One of the primary reasons that
I came to W&L was the fact that it
was one of the only small, private
universities in the South with a
journalism school of some renown,
| was particularly interested in
photo-journalism because I have de-
cided that my career will be some
type of photographic endeavor. I
was told during interviews, conversa-
tions, etc. that there was ample op-
portunity for me to follow my
photographic interest at W&L.

Upon my arrival here I sought
asylum from the initial confusion
by enrolling in the ranks of the
Calyx photographers. | hoped that
| would be assigned to one of the
several darkrooms that | had been
told about before I arrived here.
Little did I know that the Calyx,
Ring-tum Phi, and Law paper all
share the same darkroom in the
basement of the old dorm.

My high hopes were immediately
shot down by a trip to the “publi-
cations darkroom.” It looked ex-
actly like what it was—a converted
trunk room in the basement of the
old dorm behind the janitor’s closet.
Dust, disrepair, and rust were pre-
valent everywhere. Dust, the great-
est enemy of the modern photo-
grapher, was billowing forth from
every nook and cranny, including
the over-head sewage and heating
pipes.

The disrepair of the equipment
such as enlargers and dryers was to
me incredible, Rust was either form-
ing or had formed on virtually every
piece of metal in the room.

My only encouragement was that
the other photographers were almost
as displeased as | was, After leav-
ing my Sociology class in the new
science building, which looks and
even smells like the most antiseptic
of hospitals, | would never have
believed that such a place as the
“publications darkroom” existed.

To the list of deficiencies that Mr.
Buch found in the Art and Drama
departments, let me add the need
for several student darkrooms.

| will be the first to agree that
the education of a photographer, or
any other man, should include many
of the academic pursuits, from aero-
bics to Aristotle, that W&L has to
offer, but I do not think that he
should be forced to forget about f-
stops, shutter speeds, and exposure
values for four years while he pur-
sues his academic material, | also
do not think that he should be fore-
ed to “mark time” in his photograp-

hic achievement because the Uni-
versity lacks the proper facilities

Reach-Out was suggested two
years ago by students concerned
about drugs on campus and the ab-
sence of a 24-hour counseling serv-
ice, VMI donated the present facil-
ity known now as the Rockbridge
Area Problem Center.

The drug scene in Lexington is
thought to be heavy by the R. O.
staff althofgh calls concerning
drugs are not numerous, “People
who are into drugs usually take care
of themselves,” I was told by a
staffer who identified himself as
“Max.”

Today the majority of the staff
is nonstudent; the majority of the
calls come from the  nonstudent
population and concern not drugs
but poverty. Among other things the
staff secures transportation for low
income residents of the county.

For an organization that claims
to be desparately understaffed,
Reach-Out requirements are high.
Applicants are first screened to find
out if they can make a caller com-
fortable and obtain his confidence.
lhey must then complete a 36-hour
course on community and interper-
sonal problems, the physiology and
psychology of drug and alcohol
abuse, first aid and counselling tech-
nique.

Until more persons are trained,
Reach-Out will operate on a 12-hour
basis. Calls after 10 p.m. receive a
taped reply at the end of which the
caller may leave his own message.

Ken Lane describes Reach-Out as
a means of tearing down the “walls”
between the university and the
town. These “town vs. gown” ten-
sions have been historically appar-
ent, ever since a three-day riot be-
tween students and villagers rocked
Oxford in 1355, That particular epi-
sode resulted in a penance required
from the city to the university until
1825.

Perhaps the situation in Lexington
is not quite so severe, yet Reach-
Out's purpose stands as a less vio-
lent form of community interactions.

‘Vinegar Joe’ Is Sweet Music

By W. PATRICK HINELY

Vinegar Joe
Atco SD 7007

It's not often a new band comes
out with a first album which con-
tains more than about 25% worth-
while music, Such records, though,
are worth looking for, and it was
with great pleasure that I found
Vinegar Joe.

The album was recorded in Lon-
don, so I assume these people are
English, though they don’t have ac-
cents in their vocals, If they are Eng-
lish, they're the best thing to come
out of the U. K. since Emerson,
Lake & Palmer got together.

They're not entirely original in
style on a couple of cuts, but they
are competent musicians who recog-
nize their own bimitations and work
within them quite well. “Rusty Red
Armour” derives much from High-
way 61 period Dylan, both in writ-
ing and singing. With its funky-
greasy instrumental backup, it falls
together quite nicely,

Elkie Brooks is the best female
vocalist to surface in England since
Sandy Denny. She might think she’s
a limey Janis Joplin, and with a
couple of more albums, she very
well could be, Tim Hinkley’s key-
boards are the most outstanding in-
strumental element of the band,
though Pete Gage's bottleneck gui-
tar, especially in “See the World,” is
also worth mentioning. Hinkley’s
opening run on the same cut is as
good as I've heard. The added-on
horns are used just sparingly enough
to add to the music without clutter-
ing the overall sound of the band.

These people play well, have good
lyrics, and blend it all togeather in
such a fashion as to make me say
Vinegar Joe is the best new band
of 1972, though the year isn't over
yet.

This is the second in a regular
series of columns on the upcoming
election. The views are those of in-
dividual staff members and do not

as a whole, — Ed.

By LARRY CAHOON

Six weeks from now, the Ameri-
can people will elect a President.
Perhaps that should read “reelect
a President,” for if the polls are
accurate, Richard Nixon will be
swept back into office with the larg.
est plurality a Republican has ever
achieved, and possibly with a Re-
publican Congress as well, In any
event, it is probably safe to say that
George McGovern is going to be
soundly beaten,

This election, then, being more a
matter of “by how much?” than of,
“who?", it might be interesting to
speculate about the future, specific
ally, the election of 1976. No one
will have incumbency as an advan
tage, and control of at least one of
the major parties will be in some
what different hands, or at
hotly contested

The Republicans, with
Nixon retiring, will see a
struggle between two factions
liberal faction of the Rockefellers
Percy, and others vs, the conserva
tive wing of Buckley, Agnew, and a
host of young legislators now reach
ing power, Both of these wings will
benefit from a massive Republican
victory in 1972, the liberals receiv
ing the support of who, al
though left to Richard Nixon, were
driven into the Republican ranks by
McGovern's extremism, the
vatives benefiting from the

tion of what is to come, Spiro Ag
new, as Vice President, would have
the best chance for the nomina

vative victory. The nomination will
probably depend on what side Nixon
takes during his second term, but
Agnew is still the best bet.

The Democrats face a different
future, George McGovern has made
them the party of the left, with little
room for substantially different view-
points. They will probably face again
the challenge of the right, led by
Connally and Wallace, and made
stronger by McGovern’s loss in this
election, but that challenge will be
thwarted, for the

Most championship teams usually
have one thing in common, that be-
ing the so called “killer instinct.” It
can best be defined as the ability to
put another team away once you

ge them down. Last Saturday’s 15-
14 defeat at the hands of Centre
College proved that the Generals
have still failed to find this precious
commodity. The Blue held a 14-0

lead in the third quarter and looked
strong, but fumbles and the inability
to get the ball into the end zone re-
versed the momentum to Centre.
What resulted were two touchdowns
in the final two periods as the Gen-
erals saw their record drop to 1 and
iF

The Blue lost the toss for the
second week in a row, and follow-
ing the kick-off, Centre set up shop
at their own 23. They were unable
to move and punted down to the
General’s 33. The Blue were also
stalled after three plays were un-
successful, and Conrad punted it
down to the Centre 25. The same
procedure occured four more times
for Centre and three for W&L be-
fore the Blue broke out of it near
the middle of the second quarter.
Mike Brittin returned a Centre
punt to their 46 where Fluharty
went to work. After Van Amburgh
hit for 4 on the first play, Fluharty
went to the air. He found Lane on
a 14 yard gain to move the ball to
the Centre 28. Jim Farrar was drop-
ped for a one yard loss but made
up for it on the next play by taking
a pass from Fluharty in for the
score, The pass and run covered 29
yards and gave the Generals a 6-0
lead after Chase’s conversion at-
tempt was blocked.

The second half opened with Cen-
tre setting up at their own 15 fol-
lowing the kickoff. Once again the
Blue defense held strong as Centre
gained only two yards in their first
three plays. Centre tried to punt
out of trouble but failed as Me-
Laughlin broke through to block it
and the Generals gained possession
at the Centre 6. Fluharty then lost
five as he slipped down trying to
pass. However, Van Amburgh am-
ply made up for the loss by slant-
ing the eleven yards needed for the
score. This time Fluharty ran over
for a two-point conversion and the
Generals held a 14-0 lead.

Following the kickoff Centre made

a bid of its own as they drove down
to the Blue 29 in ten plays, but
were stopped at that point follow-
ing a fumble recovery by Nolan.
Two plays later the Generals gave it
back as Van Amburgh fumbled
after a gain of seven on his own 38.
Centre wasted no time as Sykes hit
Ely with a 38 yard touchdown pass
on the first play from scrimmage.
Centre elected to go for two and
were successful as Sykes hit Beck
in the end zone. The Generals mar-
gin was cut to a 14-8 count.

Sykes drove his team down to the
Blue 20 where he ran into a fourth
and 1 situation. The General's de-
fense rose to the occasion and stop-
ped Centre just short of the needed
yardage. At this point, there was
4:36 left in the game and the Gen-
erals had the ball first and 10 on
their own 19, On the first play, Van
Amburgh broke up the middle and
into the open. He traveled 37 yards
before being caught from behind at
the Centre 44. It looked at this
point like the Blue had it made. Flu-
harty sent Farrar into the line twice
netting only two yards. On third and
8 he hit Lane for six yards bringing
up a fourth and 2 with 2:21 left at
the Centre 36. Coach Leslie then
elected to have Conrad try and put
Centre deep in its own territory.
However, Conrad's punt landed in
the end zone and Centre had one
more shot with 2:14 left on the
clock.

Sykes drove Centre to the Gen-
eral 48 where he was put in a fourth
and 6 situation. This time the Blue
defense failed to meet the challenge
and Sykes hit Ely with a 43 yard
pass down to the W&L 5 where
Wallace stopped him. On the next
play Sykes went around end for the
score and the game was tied at 14
apiece with just 38 seconds left.
Berggren came in to try and kick the
extra point to put Centre ahead. He
made it good and Centre had com-
pleted its comeback and held the
lead for the first time in the game.

The last ditch effort by the Blue fol-

lowing the kickoff unsuccessful and

THE RING-TUM PHI

Booters Win Opener
Ready For Big Year

By PAUL G. CAVALIERE, JR.

This past Saturday, the W&L
Soccer team opened its 1972 season
with a very impressive victory over
Eastern Mennonite College by the
score of 3-0. This was a very big
win for the Generals. They had not
beaten this club in the past three
years. Also, as in any sport, early
victories are a necessary commodity
in so far as they inspire confidence
and team spiirt.

Mike’s best game as far as effort
and skills are concerned,” said
Coach Lyles. Schaeffer's goal made
it 3-0, and virtually put the game
out of reach,

The whole Blue team played an
excellent game. Besides the players
already mentioned, Bob Crawford
played an excellent game at center
half-back. He had very quick feet
and his traps and passes were su-
perb,

From start to finish the Generals All three fullbacks, John Gal-
controlled the game. They lost only yon, Rolf “Aggie” Piranian, and
two things all afternoon—the coin Barclay Armstrong, played  out-

toss and the First Aid Kit. Accord-
ing to Coach Joe Lyles, “the team
played outstanding soccer 85% of
the time. It was a great team effort.”
The first goal was scored early,
with only ten minutes gone in the
first half. Jim Fox booted it in, with
an assist from Bill Spofford. The
other goal in this half was scored
on a direct kick, also by Jim Fox.
This situation developed when a
shot was taken on the goal, which
got by the goalie. As a last ditch
effort one of the Royal Knights de-
fensivemen caught the ball with his
hands and stopped the goal. A pen-
alty kick ensued, and W&L grab-
bed the second of its three goals,

At half-time, Coach Lyles urged
his players not to let the opposition
score even one goal, because with
one goal under their belts, they
would try that much harder for an-
other. Needless to say, W&L came
out fighting at the start of the sec-
ond half.

standing games. They allowed very
few shots on goal and the shots that
they did allow were gobbled up by
W&L’s fine goalie Paul Devine.
Everyone on the traveling squad got
into the game and Coach Lyles was
particularly impressed with fresh-
men Bob Sillers, Bill Cogar and
Lecky Stone. Another good point
about the game was the fact that
the Generals walked away from the
game without any injuries.

Now that the first game is behind
the Blue, they have to look to a fu-
ture filled with tough opponents,
Washington and Lee’s next game is
at home today against the very ag-
gressive and always tough team
from Madison College. After that,
they take on Lynchburg College at
home on the tenth of October. J.V.
booters take on the Rats of VMI
tomorrow on the upperfield.

The season is already beginning
to take form for the Blue. Junior
Bill Spofford says that the squad is
