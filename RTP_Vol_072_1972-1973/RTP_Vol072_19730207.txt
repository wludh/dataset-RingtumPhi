The final university-wide event of
this “Fancy Dress” weekend will be
a dance in the Old Gym, featuring
“Daddy Rabbit” and “Voyce,” on
Saturday night at 8 p.m. This dance
is sponsored by the University Cen-
ter and admission will be collected

at the door, (Dance plans are not
applicable to this event.)

Billy Preston’s appearance will
mark the third concert sponsored
this year by the W&L Dance Board.
Previously, they have hosted Malo
and the J. Geils Band.

Preston has recorded two singles
which hit the charts with success—
first, “That’s the Way God Planned
It’ and second, “Outer Space,”
which received designation as the
top instrumental of the year in 1972,

A native of Houston, Texas,
Preston toured with Little Richard
ten years ago, his first introduction
to rock and roll. Since then he has
worked on sessions with Carole
King, Barbra Streisand, Stephen
Stills, Merry Clayton, Ray Charles,
and Aretha Franklin, as well as
having been a member of the tour-
ing Plastic Ono Band with John
and Yoko.

After recording two albums, pro-
duced by George Harrison, for
Apple, Preston recently joined
A&M records, for whom he has
cut his first solo album.

As usual, tickets for those who
do not hold Dance Plans will be
sold at the door at $5.00 per person.

Dick Gregory To Speak
In ‘Contact’ Symposium

Dick Gregory, social critic and
comedian, will come to Washington
and Lee University March 5 as part
of Contact '73, W&L’s annual sym-
posium sponsored by the student
body and the Interfraternity Coun-
cil,

Gregory is the second speaker
announced thus far for this year’s
symposium. Contact °73 last week
announced that Frank Mankiewicz,
former journalist and aide to Sen.
George McGovern in his bid for
the presidency last year, would open
the program Feb. 28.

Gregory's career began in the late
1950's in Chicago, reaching success
after an audition with the Chicago
Plabyboy Club. Prior to that, he
had been working at a nightclub for
five dollars a night.

The travels which accompanied
his success led Gregory to become
deeply involved with social prob-
lems in this country. He has been
particularly active in the civil rights
movement, In 1963, he led a march
in Birmingham, and he devoted
much of his next two years to civil
rights work in the south,

In 1965, the comedian was in

to attend the weekly faculty pro
ceedings. Dean Edward Atwood said
two primary reasons were that the
faculty meetings sometimes bring up
students’ which are named
cases, and that allowing students
into faculty meetings could prove
embarassing for those named stu-
dents. The dean said faculty
members might be inhibited by stu-
dents.

Gregory turned his full attention
to social problems in 1967, when
he gave up all nightclub engage-

to aid in research for his speeches.

Gregory will speak on March 5

OUTLOOK and REVIEW
Liberating The Faculty

A few weeks ago, in these very columns we tried to
liberate our faculty. More seriously, what we did was suggest
that faculty meetings be opened up, at least to some kind of
student purview.

Our general argument ran something like this: while the
EC admittedly wields control over student governmental
matters, and the University Council has power in the realm
of social regulations, still a good chunk of university policy,
particularly in the academic realm, lies with the faculty. Now,
we did not deny that students are amply represented on faculty
committees and we did not assert that students should have
voting or even floor power in matters of faculty jurisdiction.

But we merely wondered why the proceedings of the
faculty at large had to remain secret and insulated from the
students, particularly the student media.

Now since that editorial appeared, the issue has been
raised before two forums—first, before the University Coun-
cil and, secondly, before the Executive Committee. The result:
the UC voted 16-6 not to allow students at the faculty meet-
ings; the EC voted by a similar margin to recommend the
reverse.

Now, one obvious reason for the wide discrepancy of
judgment issuing from these two venerable bodies is that the
UC alone reflects, to some extent, the faculty point of view.
Just what, then, were these telling arguments which the
faculty representatives displayed before the UC?

Well, their general argument ran like this:

(1) Faculty meetings are, most of the time, really bor-
ing, and, therefore, the students don’t really want to know
what's going on.

(2) Allowing students at the faculty meeting would
pre-empt the function for which the University Council
was created, i.e., to discuss issues of mutual student-faculty
concern.

(3) Much of the business discussed at faculty sessions
involves personal cases, for which confidence should not be
broken.

(4) Journalistic accounts of the faculty proceedings
made by students would not necessarily be “objective.”

(5) Many faculty members would, somehow, feel “in-
hibited” with a student in the room.

Now, lined up and counted on authoritative faculty fingers,
these cases must have seemed pretty convincing. But are they?

First of all, to dismiss the faculty meetings as dull and
routine is not a case for closing them up. Come to think of
it, this whole campus, is, most of the time, pretty dull and
routine,

The second assertion, that the University Council would
in some manner, be undercut by opening up the faculty meet-
ings, seems downright evasive. The students are not asking
for further voice on faculty matters, just cognizance of these
matters and the arguments, pro and con, raised during the
meetings.

When individual cases are discussed, we heartily agree,
such information should not be for general consumption.
When the EC, for instance, must consider an Honor System
case or if the University Council reaches into an area con-
cerning a specific student, they go into closed session, The
agenda is arranged accordingly, and confidence is preserved.

The fourth argument is a little harder to understand, One
member of the administration said before the UC that an
“objective” account of a faculty meeting could not be assured
and that “anything important” that emerges from a faculty
meeting is announced to the students anyway, Now, we don’t
take offense at this lack of confidence in the student media—
that's unimportant. But we are a little concerned that certain
faculty members believe “objectivity” will be maintained by
their releasing whatever they think is important for the stu-
dents to know,

Finally, we don't understand why a faculty member should
feel “inhibited” before a student at a faculty meeting. Why
should he feel more restrained than a student on the EC or a
faculty member on the UC, both of whom presently say what
they have to say at meetings open to the press?

Though it may be inferred from our comments, we do not
claim that the faculty has something to hide or that the
administration is less than cooperative with the student media,
What is at issue, however, is the climate of trust which, we
are told, exists between students, faculty, and administration
at Washington and Lee.

One faculty member at the University Council offered a
rather interesting argument against opening faculty meet-
ings. He said that the proceedings would thereupon become
“merely an exercise . The decisions would all be made
behind closed doors,” As long as we're kept in the dark, we
students just can't be certain that that is not what is happen-

ing right now, N.E.P.

Doyon Speaks On Arts

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

After giving it much — serious
thought, it seems to me that in the
discussion held at the university
center on Wednesday, January 17,
concerning “the future of the fine
arts at Washington and Lee” we
got the wrong answers because we
were asking the wrong questions.
We concerned ourselves on how we
could make the art department
bigger when we should have asked
not only why we want it bigger
but how we can make it better. We
never questioned why and we quick-
ly accepted without reflection the
common fallacy that bigger is better.
(i, for one, have learned from ex-
perience that this is not always so.
I came from a large state univer-
sity with an art department more
than ten times the size of ours.
It was good, but not better than
ours. And our resources never met
our ever-increasing enrollment and
expectations. There, too, the student
“instant solution” called for more
faculty, more studio facilities, more
courses for art majors, more of the
same, Is this what we want at
Washington and Lee?)

Before there is any more discus-
sion on the future of the Art De-
partment, in word or in print, let us
review the educational goals and
obligations of a college the size of
Washington and Lee. We can do
this by reading carefully the “Philo-
sophy and Characteristics” of Wash-
ington and Lee clearly stated in our
catalogue from page 9 through 14.
(How many of our most vocal art
students calling for “special courses
for art majors only” have read it?

By J. JASON MATTHEWS

It has been five weeks since
Christmas vacation has ended and
the slight paunch developed because
of the extra food is gone, in its
place returns the familiar “starved
gerbil” look so popular with the
student “a la mode.” The well-
greased machinery of DUBYANEL
rolls on and you lay in the dust,
tread marks on your back, awed by
its amazing power.

You always think that the rest
you get from a couple of weeks at
home will give you enough energy

First of all, my dear, before I explain that I cou

I did before accepting a position at
Washington and Lee—every word
most carefully! I found myself in
complete agreement with its high
educational goals, and I still believe,
to quote this seldom-read passage,
that “the best educated man is the
liberally educated man”, page 10.)

For those who desire to prepare
for an art career, | strongly recom-
mend graduate school. In fact, even
if we succeeded in offering an art
program on the scale possible only
at the largest universities, further
study is indispensable. A four-year
degree in any field does not carry
much weight in today’s job market,
if a career is what is expected from
college. (Actually, trade schools are
more successful than four-year col-
leges in placing their trainees.) All
that a college of our size can be
expected to do is provide for quality
education through small classes and
individual attention, This we do well
but climbing enrollment in = art
classes has made this obligation in-
creasingly more difficult. (And, I
suspect, this is the cause of student
frustration wrongly vented upon
“the administration” or “the chair-
man” or some other easy target.)
Unless we are prepared to throw
millions into the art department
instantly, we can only do the best
we can with what we have.

But we can achieve our primary
goals with our present facilities if
we insist on the highest standards,
The art department will not be
bigger in the future but it will be
better. And by being better we will
have a better Washington and Lee.
Our students will be welcomed into
the best graduate schools. All of
us, administration, faculty, and stu-

Letters To The Editor...

dents really want nothing less from
Washington and Lee and should not
settle for anything less. If we can’t
be the biggest, let’s be the best!

I have arrived at these conclusions
not through “pressure” from anyone
but through the pressure of exist-
ing facts and figures revealed in the
Report of the Registrar distributed
to all the faculty. Art grades in some
courses are not realistic, to be sure.
More important, there is a gap be-
tween the ideals of a Washington
and Lee education and the type of
art education demanded by a vocal
few here. It is not possible to have
both at the same time in the near
future, if it is desirable at all,
What the art department does well
is what other departments do well,
We are no different and should not
be different. The Art Department is
an intregal part of ou rhigh quality
Washington and Lee liberal arts
education and should remain so.
I'm proud of it and will see to it
that I will always be proud of it.

agree with the position that we can
and should provide an education for
“underprivileged” minorities asks you
to go against many things that you
believe to be the case. It asks you
to believe that there is more to a

grades, It asks qou to go on “purely

deemed as “unrealistic” by our edi-

A chance that might bring men

necessary to establishing my point
about the inaccuracy of the present

do so even at the expense of truth.

Look at grades, but be mind-

the best indicator, Look at test

be as accurate as you believe at

that might be associated with that
position. The most important thing

out things about him or are you

RING-TUM PHI

    

Phi Sticks With Its Guns,
Rips Hapless LUR, 72-72

By PAUL SIMPSON

Last Friday night, in a rare dis-
play of outside shooting, the Ring-
tum Phi and WLUR-FM tied 72-72
in the first of their semi-annual
games. The last game between these
two rivals took place July 13 in
Doremus Gymnasium, As you all
remember, the Ring-tum Phi team
failed to show up. So the WLUR
team took the court and, after con-
trolling the opening tap, tried (un-
successfully) to score during the next
two minutes, Referee Norwood
“Skip” Paukert then blew the ball
dead and, invoking an obscure rule,
called the game on account of rain.

Shocked, the WLUR team was
quieted when Paukert showed them
the rule that allowed him to do
this. Unfortunately, they did not
notice that Pauckert was inadvert-
antly using an NCAA baseball rule
book. It was equally surprising that
the WLUR team did not catch on
when, during their two minute
shooting spree, every fourth ball
that missed the basket, Paukert
would yell “Take your base.” Be-
cause of this, the game ended 0-0
with the WLUR team (as usual)

in a state of bewilderment.

Last Friday saw two teams who
came to play and left without doing
so. The Ring-tum Phi was led by
Twerp-in-Chief “Skip” Paukert who,

when the Ring-tum Phi was winning

the refrees to call the game on
account of rain.
Sports Editor Palmer Palmer

Palmer (or Palmer Trice as he has
come to be known) failed to show
because of a “business engagement.”
Reportedly, a man answering Trice’s
description made large bets on the
WLUR team.

The WLUR team was led by
Chet Burgess who, last year you
will remember, was voted MVP on
the winning WLUR team when he
convieniently ran into the scorer’s
table, giving the scorekeeper a mild
concussion and then volunteeering
to keep score himself the rest of
the game.

The refereeing of “Honest John”
Hughes and Bob “Reliable Source”
Keefe was indecribable. Keefe, who
appeared to be in a slight daze the
whole game was reportdly mumbl-
ing “. . . all I wanted to do was
find the men’s room” throughout
the game.

Hughes, on the other hand, was
in an obvious state of enchantment,
singing out periodically that he did
not care who won, because both
teams were paying him,

Matmen Win,
Host U.N.C.

By KEN RUSCIO

The Washington and Lee westling
team raised its record to 9-5 last
Saturday by defeating V.C.U. and
Campbell and losing to Pembroke
in a gruelling triple dual meet. It
was the second week in a row
that Coach Piper’s well-conditioned
team had successively endured such
an ordeal giving evidence that the
team is rapidly approaching peak
form in time for the upcoming
tournaments. Don Overdorff led the
way in the 118 class by posting
pins against Campbell and VCU
and gaining a clear decision over
his Pembroke opponent. In doing
so he upped his individual record
to 9-1-1, currently the best on the
team.

In the narrow win over VCU
(23-19), Lee Keck at 126 and Sam
Lewis at 177 gained key decisions,
Bill Melton’s (134) and Rolf Piran-
ian’s (142) draws preserved the
margin of victory. Lewis also ex-
celled in the Campbell win by pin-
ning his opponent. Also against
Campbell Doug Ford pinned giving
him the team lead for the season
with five. Jim Strieff, Rick Heldrick,
and Dan White added decisions to
make the final score 27-19. In los-
ing to a tough Pembroke squad the
Generals were only able to gain
four decisions—Overdorff, Melton,
Steir and Ford.

Hopes are high for W&L in the
all-important VCAA meet to be held
at Doremus Gymnasium on Febru-
ary 14. At the conference meet
(Feb. 23-24) the Generals will be
well represented by their most suc-
cessful team in memory. Coach
Piper is also planning to send his
top three wrestlers to the NCAA
college division championship — in
South Dakota. The team has given
every indication of continuing their
winning ways in the weeks ahead.

 

Everyone knew Billy. A day
rarely went by that he didn’t
in some way touch every athlete's
life who entered Doremus Gym.
From a “mere” wave before
practice to sneaking paddle ball
rackets to the cross country run-
ners, the little man in the equip
ment room was as much a part
of the athlete's lives as the sport
in which they participated. He
expected little in return for the
tasks he performed, merely the
pure enjoyment of watching foot-
ball or absorbing the activity of
a basketball game. He found
satisfaction in working at WA&l
and we're glad because we owed
Billy much more than we could
possibly return.

Billy Davis died a week ago
Monday of a heart attack at the
age of fifty-eight. Everyone who
know him will find it impossible
nol to miss him; he was someone
who, by the his gregarious nature.
was intensely involved in W&l
athletics and the athletes he so
generously helped.

Generals after the games this past
weekend. The Generals truly put
on impressive performances in
downing Bridgewater 82-56 and
Emory and Henry 70-55. The Gen-
erals look better with each per-
formance, and that’s a good sign
with only four more games on the
schedule before the C.A.C. Tourna-
ment February 22-24, at Sewanee.
Verne Canfield has done a good
job of developing and exploiting the
talent of this team. At times they
did not come on as quickly as he
thought they should have, but as
he said earlier this year after a
particularly bad stretch of games,
“I still have condfience in them.”
And finally all that confidence is
beginning to pay off.

Washington and Lee got off to a
roaring start on Friday night with
that impressive 26-point victory over
Bridgewater. Junior Skip Lichtfuss
turned in a truly impressive per-
formance, throwing shots in from
every conceivable spot and direc-
tion, and a few he made up for
the occasion, Lichifuss got 26 points
and 12 rebounds and was supported
by Bo Williams who got 12 points

stands instead of taking up periodic
residence on the court,

Washington and Lee opened the
game in a half-court press which
the Wasps never quite figured out,
even though they saw it for ex-
tensive portions of the game. The
Generals had great success with the
press as Clelan, Williams and Strain
consistently forced turnovers which
usually resulted in easy baskets at
the other end of the court. Bo
Williams got 10 of his 12 points in
the first half, primarily as a result

of the press. Paul MeClure’s stra-
tegic loss of a contact allowed WAL
a rest from their pressing efforis
about three-quarters of the way into
the first half. In addition to this
Paul blocked several shots ia the
first half and proved quite intimi-

By CLIF OVERCASH

and JIMMY BAIRD
As a final tune-up for the upcom-
ing Virginia College Athletic As-
sociation state meet, the Washing
ton and Lee swim team handily de-
feated the University of Richmond,
65-47, last Saturday. The Generals,
obviously looking ahead to the
VCAA meet next weekend, wasted
no time in brushing off the Spiders.
Top performances included a new
school record for Bill Tiers in the
1,000 yard freestyle, first in the 50
yard freestyle and 200 yd. butterfly

freestyle. Other wins went to Alan
Corwith in the 500 yd. freestyle,
Steve Erickson in the 200 back-
stroke, and Billy Cogar in the 1 and
3 meter diving.

The Richmond contest gave all of
Coach Bill Sterans’ swimmers a
chance to participate, and several
responded admirably, Among them

were Mike Moore, Tom Koung,
Gary Seldmomridge, Alan  Petti-
grew, and John Henzel. After this
weekend's VCAA meet, the Gen-

erals go to Charlottesville for the

Mr. Editor, | enjoy your cute quips
at the end of my letters, they reveal
so much about you. However I
would appreciate it if you took the
time to inform the student body
about the issue in greater length.
Maybe it’s time that this issue
got off the second page and on to
the front. I have a question for
you: Who is the “we” that you
speak of with such authority, is it
the student body? Are you the
representative of this “we” that
knows minorities and realism so
well, or are you and the student
body one and the same?

My fellow students | have a gut
feeling about you, only you will be
able to resolve the recruitment situa-
tion. At present only a token effort
exists, whether it is allowed to con-
tinue rests entirely up to your re-
sponses to the administration.

forefront of the British cinema and

If... is set within the con-
fines of a posh English boarding
school that is collapsing under the
weight of its 1,000 year history.
It concerns the lives and rebellions
of three non-conforming students—
Mick, Johnny, and Wallace—who
mingle their blood in a ceremony
of solidarity.

Anderson once told Cloude
Delmas: “If... is not meant to
be a film that excites or agitates,
but I hope that the people will
understand it; this is why the di-
vision into chapters and, up to a
certain point, the use of black and
white and colour, are what Brecht
calls processes of distinction which
detach the spectator from his emo-
ms 4.

As the film gathers its momentum,
it makes the startling transition from
conventional public school drama to
guerrilla warfare. The three react

arbitrary punishment, wreaking

legs over the back of the next seat
at the Bolshoi if you are wearing a
long sheath dress? These problems
must be settled between you and
the people you associate with. The
Three Stooges gag of sitting on
someones lap while they are hold-
ing a plate of potato salad has gone
out of vogue.

(d) Facial Expression: Above all,

decorum and ennui must be the
keynote here. Even if you are seat-
ed next to the Indian Ambassador's
son who is suffering from choleric
catarrah, you must, at all costs,
feign indifference. Mild delight was
once acceptable but with the pass-
ing of Isadora Duncan, it is con-
sidered stilted.
(e) The Voice: The think this year
for voices is the Carmelita Pope
Whisper. Loud raucous yelling was
never really acceptable, and with
the advent of the communication
gap it becomes even less so. The
trick is to make the person you are
talking with think that maybe his
hearing is going. Mouthing every
20th word will be effective.

Advanced behavior is an elusive
concept. Staring at your partner
over the rim of a wine glass with-
out going cross-eyed, suggestive little
pressures of the hand withdrawn
before the cigarette can burn you,
working up to the good-night kiss
without stammering, all fall into
this category. These techniques can
only be perfected by many long
hours of practice with one of those
inflatable “Party Dolls” advertised
in the back of the Police Gazette.

Finally, the Big Apple, the Dam
Burster, the Goodnight Kiss. All
the care in the world must be taken
not to seem too anxious or nerv-
ous. Whining and whimpering are
dead giveaways so try to keep those
at a minimum. Many times a grip
around the waist can be applied
too tightly, and while this is an
effective method of snapping the
spine of a would-be mugger it usu-

ally dampens the ardour of a would-
be dater. If you happen to have
a cleft plate warn your partner
before you kiss, as the new sensa-
tion could induce vomiting. Finally,
don't feel at all embarrassed. Kiss-
ing is a natural, healthy way of
showing affection for another per-
son, much like grooming a horse
or shining a turtle’s shell.

Dating can be a wonderful ex-
perience. In this, the “springtime”
of our lives, nothing could be finer
than to stroll down a cherry blos-
som arbor, hand-in-hand with the
person you care for, perhaps sing-
ing a tune, or just listening to the

Generals Beat Bridgewate, E-H,
Prepare For CAC Tournament

(Continued from page 3)
General line-up, especially on the
boards kept E&H at a constant dis-
advantage. But the hustle began to
wane, Emory and Henry’s outside
shooting improved, and Licktfuss
picked up his fourth foul.

At this point the Wasps made
their only significant run of the
night at the Generals| But the Gen-
erals recovered enough to blunt the
thrust. Lichtfuss fouled out at 6:28
and soon afterwards both Paul Mc-
Clure and Gary Fitzgerald got into
foul trouble; each with four, Now
it was Verne Confield’s chance to
show off his bench, who if they
didn’t give an outstanding perform-
ance, certainly gave an extremely
steady one as they blunted the E&H
attack and finished the game going
away. In a capsule the game boiied
down to the superior play of W&L,
especially its defense, as opposed to

the outclassed Emory and Henry
team. The Generals showed team
play and balanced scoring in a well
deserved victory as they had four
men in double figures: Guy Kerr
with 13, Bowman Williams with 12,
and Lichtfuss and McClure with 10
each,

In addition to these two games,
Washington and Lee made a clean
sweep of the weekend by winning
both Frosh games. The freshmen
defeated Bridgewater 78-75 with
John Rice talleying 30 points, and
then finished the weekend and ex-
tending their record to 9-2 by de-
feating Massanutten 87-60, Wash-
ington and Lee basketball prospects
are taking a turn for the beter and
with the tournament coming up it
looks like a tough W&L team that’s
headed for Sewanee in search of
another CAC championship.

Phi Sticks With Its Guns

(Continued from page 3)

Seriously though, Warren Davis
was excellent for the Phi (even
though no one can remember when
he last wrote for them) and Don
Eavenson played well for WLUR
(even though he didn't know W&L
had a radio station.)

But who could forget the cli-
mactic ending that will be remem-
bered for years to come! As Paul
Cavaliere (who had a good game
for the Phi) brought the ball up
the court, Wayne “Hot Tip” Baker
charged off the bench bowling
Cavaliere over, saying something to
the effect that “it’s my ball and
you can’t play with it any more
‘cause I'm going home.”

After Baker was quieted and the
ball retrieved, Cavaliere went to the
foul line for what could be the
winning shot (there were only 20
seconds left). About the same time,
a middle-aged lady made her way
through the crowd and appeared
under the basket asking “the funny
lithe man in the striped shirt (ob-
viously a reference to Keefe) to
move so I can take a picture.”

By the time the referees had re-
moved her, the continuous run-
