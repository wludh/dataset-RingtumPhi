OUTLOOK and REVIEW!
Shutting Out The Students

Whenever anyone begins to enumerate those special virtues
which makes Washington and Lee a distinctive place to learn,
at least two (in addition to the Honor System) are sure to be
mentioned. One is the mutual respect and closeness between
faculty members and their students. The second is the ex-
tensive power granted to students in governing their own
affairs,

And, indeed, this power has become more and more ex-
tensive over the last few years. Nearly every faculty subcom-
mittee has managed to add student representatives. The Uni-
versity Council, cumbersome but still pretty effective with its
twelve faculty members and twelve students, has been created
to handle issues of student concern.

Still there are two realms of decision-making which have
heen traditionally closed to the students’ view. Overall uni-
versity policy, of course, continues to rest with the Board
of Trustees. And now, thanks to the cooperative efforts of
some EC members and some Board members, the Trustees’
vital deliberations will be open to the student body president.
A\ student ear and voice will be directly available.

In the second realm, however, students are still shut out
entirely. Now it has been said that students really woud be
bored stiff if they knew what went on at the monthly general
faculty meetings. Yet the faculty retains a great deal of
power—in fact, sole power over all important academic
matters.

We can think of many issues which are discussed in these
meetings—e.g., independent exams, or new courses, or grad-
ing policy—which students should be aware of. How the
faculty arrives at its decisions should be a matter of open
concern.

Under the present arrangement, if a student wants to
address the faculty or bring some matter to its attention, he
may be invited to do so. The student body president, for
instance, may come to a faculty session, say what he has to
say, and then leave immediately.

Why shouldn't the head of the student government be
permitted to observe the proceedings? For that matter, we
believe the meetings should be opened up to the student media,
as well, so that the student body can be aware of how the
faculty stands on issues of university-wide interest,

Certainly this is not a very radical proposal. Many
other universities and colleges have students actually voting
on academic issues. For these meetings to be shrouded in total
secrecy seems somewhat unnecessary.

Of course, we anticipate the arguments against allowing
students to view faculty proceedings. Discussion, they will
say, would be terribly inhibited if a faculty member knows a
student is watching and listening to what he says. And see-
ondly, think of the possibility of a professor being embarrassed
hy a stand he takes or something he says.

" But do these arguments really justify shutting students
out? We toot our horns constantly about the honesty and trust
hetween faculty and students—why then should a faculty
member be inhibited from saying something in front of a
student that he would freely say before a fellow faculty
member ?

As of now, rumors fly after each faculty meeting con-
cerning who said what and what went on, On the other hand,
each meeting of the Executive Committee and the University
Council is fully reported and open to public view ; why should
a faculty meeting be afforded insulation and protection from
the same kind of serutiny ?

In the current issue of the Washington and Lee bulletin,
President Huntley is quoted as summarizing the university in
this wavy—as an institution which “confidently entrusts the
largest possible measure of choice and freedom to its students
and its faculty, requiring conformity of no one (in an environ-
ment of) tolerance, integrity, and respect for others,

Let's make certain that we're fully living up to this ideal

Letters To The Editor...

Steel vs. Matthews

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

I wish to direct a few remarks to
Mr. Jason Matthew's piece in last
week's Phi, “Some Impressions On
Returning To W&L Country Club, .”

In that article, you will remember,
Matthews relates his emotions on
returning to W&L after Christmas
break and offers some allegedly
humourous suggestions on how to
alleviate the boredom and alienation
which he feels are the inevitable
product of return. He suggests a

Black Focus

A Tribute

In Honor of the Birthday of
Dr. Martin Luther King

By JOHNNY E, MORRISON

“No man is an island, entire of
itself.” No words can be so appro-
priate to carry the philosophical
concepts of Martin L. King than
the ones found in John Donne's
“For Whom The Bells Toll.”

Martin L. King’s life was depicted
as one of trials, moments of joy,
deliberation, quick decision making,
love and hatred. Monday was a
day set aside by Black people to
pay special tribute to a man con-
sidered to be one of the Black
Messiahs of Black people. The Stu-
dent Association for Black Unity
would like to take time to pay
tribute to a true Black leader who in
his own way, did his part for what
we think of “the cause.”

Brother Martin was a man who
was born into a world which was
(and still is, in a covert manner)
infested with hatred, racism, and
egotistical drives. The superiority
complex found its haven in the
minds of many whites while the
damaging factors of the inferiority
complex became a psychological
stigma on the minds of Blacks,
We believe the most important con-
tribution that brother King gave
to not only the Black but people
all over the world was his untiring
efforts to challenge customs and tra
ditions,

He showed us (both black and
white) that all men are equal in
the eyes of God; and all men are
part of this vast island. No matter
how whites try to repress it in the
back of their minds, the only dif
ference between them and Black
people is the pigmentation of their
skins |

fortunate Blacks who realized that

variety of “pastimes” with which
to amuse ourselves as we course
through the winter semester. Un-
fortunately, the effect of his article
is anything but humourous: it points
up a serious defect in contemporary
thought.

Mr. Matthews suffers from
chronic malaise, he evidences a feel-
ing of despair when he writes of
what a generally rotten place WAL
is. He invites us to join his self-
flaggelation with tales of “Woe Is
Me™ and “Ain't This Place Awful.”
He says, “We should draw on each

class America and grasped the “new
man” armour. Brother King was
one of the pioneers who did not
fear the tyranny of the majority
but he helped pick up the lower-
status Blacks out of their abyss of
despair.

He was one of the pineers who
show the American society that
somewhere deep down in its’ values
and cultures something was wrong.
He challenged America in the
church, on the streets, and in the
courts to prove to her that she had
given Black people a bad check.
This check was made to all Ameri-
cans for the amount that “we hold
truths to be self-evident that all
men are created equal; that they
are endowed by their creator with
certain inalienable rights: that among
these are life, liberty and the pusuit
of happiness.”

Brother King showed the world
that particular check was void in
this affluent society as long as this
society held social, political and
economical concepts about the Black
mass which automatically gave
Blacks second-rated status,

Now, Brother King’s body has
left us but his ideas and soul still
remain a permanent part of our
mind and conscious, Brother King
went to the mountain top and his
eyes saw the coming of the glory
of the Lord. How long must it take
the American society to alleviate
poverty and injustice

Brother King, through non-viol
worked on the social consei
ence of America. How long musi

other's misery, we must stick to-
gether and vomit en masse.” Mr.
Matthew's article waves the flag
of apathy and despair finding
“power. (in) innocuousness,
vacuity and overall divinely-inspired
disgust. . .”

This is meant to be funny. In
fact, Mr. Matthews own vacuity is
rather pathetic. In admonishing us
to turn on and to drop out Mat-
thews is being anything but original
and witty, rather he is breathing
once again the sigh of the Dis-
affected Young Man who in_ his
own mind is living in the twilight
of culture and whose fin de siecle
attitude gives witness to his own
moral bankruptcy. Ghosts of T.
Leary of Haight-Ashbury, of the
Angry Young Men rise from his
article and exhort us to join their
self-abnegation, But what did Leary
prove? What did the rioters ac-
complish? Nothing. Matthews, hei:
apparent and avant garde of the
Malaise Generation likewise proves
nothing.

I do not agree that Washington
and Lee, and by inference our sur-
rounding society, is the wasteland
that the elitists decry, Obviously we
have problems here at W&L and in
our country as a whole. But empty,
nonsensical articles such as “Re-
flections, etc.” impede progress when
they insinuate “Why brother?”, One
wonders if the only time Matthews
debate, meaningful relationship ot
interpersonal contact ” Satu-
rated with 70¢ Apple Run wine we
could hardly do otherwise.

What | am criticising is not so
much Matthews"s essay, which was
shallow and unimportant, but the
attitudes behind the articles. | am
criticising his antecedents who taught
my generation that the only way to
look at life is sideways, with a
sneer, Never have I read a truly
perceptive, dispassionate analysis of
a prpblem area in our society by a
young pseudo-intellectual: alone in
their other-wordliness they no not
contribute to human progress, Mat-
thews's atlempt at witty social criti-
cism fell flat because he would
rather vomit on reality than try to
understand it

My point is simply this: if this
generation is intent upon reforming
the world we must be deaf to the
prophets of doom and despair who
distort reality and call it emptiness
Reality is reality, not vacuity, Mat
thews writes from inside a vacuum
| prefer the outside.

Griff Steel, ‘73

For those who want to see what
all the fuss is about, Mr. Mat-
thews continues his impressions on
the next page. We request Mr,
Steel please to look the other way.

Kessling Raps Phi

To The Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

We read with great interest the
debate last week over Student Body
President Brennan's proposal to
make class officers members of the
Student Control Committee and find
ourselves asking: If incompetence
is here, can paralysis be far be-
hind?

We must go through the debate
word by word to understand the
irue implication involved. The Ring-
tum Phi stated, “Many members
expressed belief that by doing so
(placing class officers on the SCC),
the quality of the officers would
be immediately improved.”

Thus these members seem to be
saying that either the SCC is cur-
rently manned by incompetents of
that our present class officers are
incompetent. Mr. Merrill sems to
believe the latter since The Ring-tum
Phi said that he suggested
that the Brennan proposal might
further weaken the integrity of the
SCC.” lt also appears that Mr.
Merrill is none too happy with the
current SCC, We would remind him
the Executive Committee appointed
the current SCC members,

To continue—Our student news
pape: “Jim Overton, speaking
for the proposal said that he sup-
ported the action on the grounds
that, ‘since these pe ple (class offic-
ers) are elected they should be given
something to do’.” We wonder then,
why

said,

we have elected class officers
all these years

Mr, Keatley, repre
sentative, then injected his ideas into
the debate, according to The Ring:
tum Phi, by saying that
because the class officers were basic-
ally social offices, the placement of
class officers automatically on the
SLC could have the result of having
an all-fraternity committee.” Mr.
Gray answered this by saying he
felt “ Keuailey’s position was
invalid because the fraternity people
are the only ones seeking positions
of responsibility on campus.” We
honestly believe Mr. Gray will live
to regret saying that

We should not

Dining Out In Lexington

Sumptuous Fare at Kenney 5

By JESS REEVES

As anyone knows, the ham-
burger is the staple of the W&L
man’s diet, So, in our continuing
series on “Dining Out,” we sent
reporter Reeves to Lexington’s
one and only genuine hamburger
joint—Kenney’s on Waddell St.

Herewith, his impressions on din-
ing on a Big K.—Ed.

Too often many of us ignore or
are unaware of the finer things in
life. Such is the case of many Wash-
ington and Lee students who are
seemingly unconcerned with the cer-
ters of gastronomy in Lexington. The

expenditures in terms of time and
money are sacrifices the student is
usually unwilling to make, as long
as his stomach is full. The nearest
place will do for a small snack so
everyone runs to Central Lunch,
Paramount, or Mother’s and com-
plains of heartburn,

Why Can’t We Have
A Winter Carnival?

By J. JASON MATTHEWS

Talking to someone from Dart-
mouth is really difficult. | bet even
talking to a Franciscan monk about
the latest Fredrick’s of Hollywood
catalogue would be easier because
those poor guys at Dartmouth have
no one within a 100-mile radius to
go and visit and they know it and
it affects them. Winter really hits
hard and all around their austere
red-brick and ivy-green campus, cun-
ning little chickadees feeders and
squirrel roosts appear outside every-
one’s window,

The snow comes down from
Canada and up from New Jersey
and from either side, and the most
exciting thing Dartmouth men have
to look forward to is next month's
issue of Ski magazine. That is ex-
cept Winter Carnival.

If | ever would go to Dartmouth,
(assuming they'd have me), it would
be for Winter Carnival. In essence
it is a four-day snowy baccanale
featuring ice sculptures, parties,
tobaggan races, skating fests, and
for once in the year, women, From

Boston, from New York, from
Smith, Holyoke and Vassar they
come, for Dartmouth’s Winter

Carnival is like our Fancy Dress
used to be. It is an event. Christ,
even a Playmate went up to Dart-
mouth for Winter Carnival and had
a good time.
Anyway, this
thinking. Why

made me Start
can't we have a

Winter Carnival here at Lexington?
Why let Dartmouth be one up? I
have prepared a brief calendar to
illustrate that it is entirely pos-
sible. It would break up the drudg-
ery of Winter Term, and if we are
really lucky, some Playmate might
come down. (Even one of those
pin-up girls from Army Laff Time
would be O.K.).

1ST DAY—Friday

3:30—A special bell would begin
ringing in Lee Chapel to signal the
start of the DUBYANEL Winter
Carnival. To get the festivities roll-
ing, there would be a reenactment
of the Liberty Hall Volunteers drill-
ing on the vee of the Battle of New
Market. It could be a slapstick skit
with creme-pie fights and foam rub-
ber drill rifles that would droop
hilariously when pointed at the
spectators. A second skit at 5:00
would be performed for those stu-
dents in late-afternoon science labs.

6:00—A_ school-wide masquerade

Jack Paar Disappointing
As New Program Begins

Editor's Note: Last week, Jack
Paar premiered his new late night
talk show on the ABC television
network. The show is scheduled
to appear at 11:30 p.m., Mon-
day through Friday, of every
fourth week on Channel 13,

By BRYAN HATCHETT
R-TP Television Editor

Jack Paar defined his line of work
on last Tuesday's show: “I don't do
anything and later I bring
out other people to do it with
me.” This line, typical of others
that come upon talk show opening
monologues, prompts one to ask:
exactly how does the viewing public
want to be entertained after 11:30
p.m.?

The answer in most television
markets is movies. But for those
who prefer their fiction mixed with
video taped conversation, the al-
ternative is the late night talk show,

The genre is synonymots with
Paar himself, In his latest outing,
Jack Paar casts himself as the under-
dog trying to make a much de-
served comeback.

On Tuesday's show, with much
fanfare, Paar told the “W.C.” story
that sparked his resignation at NBC
and the demise of his “Tonight
Show.” And it proved to be quite
funny and unworthy of censorship
by today’s standards and probably
by the standards of the early sixties
when it was first told.

Unfortunately, Paar did not stop
there. As the week progressed, he
subjected his viewers to a surfeit of
gratuitous remarks about past op-
pression by NBC, the press, and
fellow performers and current op-
pression by ABC, his staff, and other
forces too numerous to mention

rhis nightly catharsis of self-pity
climaxed on Friday's show when
Paar, again in the underdog role,

explained that he had whipped the
system, the establishment (or what-
ever it is that he is fighting) and
would come out ahead of Carson
in the rating game. All very nice,
but who cares?

At the same time, Paar was pick-
ing a fight with some poor schmuck
who had the audacity to suggest
that the show was not the greatest
thing since sex—and to say it in
the New York Daily News of all
places.

With tears in her eyes, little,
buck-toothed Mimi Hines entered
on cue to tell all of America not
to stand for such talk as that and
to march behind Jack Paar all the
way to Armageddon just to prove

attend, Those declining would be
put in riotous Winter Carnival
Stocks and left out all night.

2ND DAY—Saturday

11:00—The Main Celebration
begins with the lighting of the
Carnival torch under those students
left out during the previous night.
As they thaw, tobaggan races, snow-
ball fights and snow-shoveling com-
petition would take place on the
main campus, Along the Collonade,
concessions would be in operation.
The Science department could make
delicious and different colored “sno-
cones” for the students while the
Religion department serve volatile
“hot rum toddies” to everyone who
has an 1.D. to preve they are 21.

12:00—Another masquerade lunch
buffet in Evans Dining Hall would
take place, this time with a Jack
London motif. An award to the stu-
dent who comes most convincingly
dressed as a mangy, hunger-mad-
dened wolf will be presented after
the meal.

2:00—The Ice Sculpture com-
mences in Wilson Field. Individual
students along with each department
would have an hour to freeze,
chisel, shape and contour their indi-
vidual creations, much to the enter-
tainment of the students looking on
from the bleachers, Numerous
awards would be given, and to pre-
vent the 15 predictable “recumbent
Gen. Lee” pieces, originality would
be foremost in importance.

The departments would be bound
by the rules to sculpt something
their field claims to be their own,
Hysterical results are no doubt in
store as gleeful students would view
the English department trying to
sculpt “onomatopoeia” or the His-
tory department carving their rendi-
tion of “hegemony.” Those competi-
tors sculpting anything obscene, in
the opinion of the judges, would be
put in the Carnival Stocks for the
night.

6:00—At this time, there would
be yet another masquerade buffet
dinner, the theme of which would
be Sergeant Preston of the North.
Prizes again would be awarded for
the male student most effectively
portraying Nell, the heroine, or the
most convincing female dressed as
Sgt. Preston.

would rage until the early hours
of the morning, the only difference
this evening being those who refuse

If one care enough to venture far
afield from campus, innumerable
establishments of higher eating can
be found in the city. We say, what
about Kenney Burger? Certainly it
must be worth the trip to the fringe
of the Lexington suburbs,

The KB offers students the unique
opportunity of enjoying good food
and good company, If one goes to
the Quid one finds oneself solely in
the company of fellow students. At
KB one can expand one’s horizons
while feasting on that masterpiece—
the Big K. Here the student can
rub shoulders with townies who are
full, happy, and docile.

Aside from offering the chance to
associate with your Lexington High
friends, the KB presents a fine
menu, There are, of course, burgers,
shakes fries, and dogs to be had.
The burgers have an unusual smell
and taste of carefully barbecued,
grade A shoe leather. The big K
shows all the artistry Kenney’s has
to offer in the burger line. (Order
one if you think the steady drip,
drip, drip of excess stomach acid is
worth 60c).

Chicken and Other Delites

Kenney’s hot dogs are really not
too bad. Beverages are strictly run-
of-the-mill. Chicken is perhaps Ken-
ney'’s best and strongest claim to a
place in “Who's Who in American
Restaurants.” The chicken delight
dinner at $1.30 includes all a home-
fried Southerner could wish for,
Such a varied and sundry bill of
fare is sure to keep the patron eager
and anxious for more.

Another strong point in Kenney’s
favor is the decor. Generally speak-
ing it looks like any other burger
joint, but a certain amount of imagi-
nation has been used on furnishings
as well as food. The large plastic
picnic tables inside are functional
but unimpressive (even for picnic
tables). A rather large, more than
alive and less than healthy fern adds
a touch of Victorian elegance.

In addition to these virtues the
service at Kenney’s can be fast and
courteous, at least, most of the time.
The window presents a panoramic
view of southeast Lexington. And,
lest we forget, the KB is conveni-
ently located next to what has been
called the Greyhound bus station
for those quick bites on the run,

The Kenney Burger can offer fine
food and entertainment reasonably
priced. One can dine handsomely for
less than a dollar in the midst of
Lexington society, You will prob-
ably want to have the wrapper off
your first Big K burger autographed
by the Swiss chef Clem so you can
put it in the family scrap book. Do
yourself a favor and visit the Ken-
ney Burger, but don't go so often
that you wear out a good thing!

Winter Consort’s Newest

By W. PATRICK HINELY
Icarus
Paul Winter/Winter Consort

Here is a prime selection for the
Global Village’s musical library. The
geographical and stylistic diversity
of the Consort's sources span the
panet, along with most of the uni-
verse. Winter calls this album a
collection of musical images of the
sun; it is all that and more. It
sounds nice, too.

Paul Winter has studied and played
the music of hundreds of cultures
the world over, He and the other
members of the Consort have had
the conventional conservatory train-
ing which all classically oriented
musicians must go through to have
a chance at professional recognition.

All have total control over their
instruments, David Darling on cello
is capable of making it speak any
language he wishes it to. Winter on
saxophone and Paul McCandless on
oboe and English horn set up beau-
tifully delicate harmonies. Ralph
Towner on guitar—acoustic, mind
you—has developed a style which

Salata

 

 

 

can be fit into any given category of

music and yet any other at the
same time.
Talking about individual cuts

from Tearus is luxuriously futile; the
sides are arranged in such a way as
to sound like different movements
of one continuous composition, but
they are at the same time each dis-
tinct unto themselves.

Attempts at categorizing and
labeling the types of music in the
Consort's sound is difficult, to say
the least. As closely and simply as
it can be verbalized, | would say

the Consort plays improvisational
jazz (what other kind is there?)
based upon any other types of

music from anywhere on the planet
you would or could care to name.
Indian, Brazilian, African, Baroque,
Romantic, Renaissance, Jazz( and
so on, All those and more.

Buy two or three copies and keep
one for yourself. Give the rest to
people you love. Tearus is much
more lasting than flowers,

This music is at home wherever
you take it.

Alumnus Chenery, Owner

Of Riva Ridge, Dead at 86

By PAUL SIMPSON

Christopher T. Chenery, nation-
ally known sportsman and a mem-
ber of Washington and’ Lee's board
of trustees, died after a lengthy ill-
ness at the age of 86,

Mr. Chenery graduated from
Washington and Lee with a degree
in engineering in 1909, He was
elected to the board of trustees in
1950 and served in that capacity
until his retirement some three years
ago

For two years he attended Ran
dolph-Macon College in Ashland,
where he grew up, but left school
at 16 in order to earn money to
continue his education at Washing
tion and Lee, where he was elected
io Phi Beta Kappa

On graduation, he worked for a
time in the Pacific Northwest as an
engineer then in 1914 joined a
reconnaisance party that was survey-
ing potential rights-of-way for the
first railroad through Alaska. The
group traveled by pack train and
raft.

Mr. Chenery served in the Army
Engineer Corps in World War 1
and later started his own enginee!
ing firm in New York in 1926. Ten
years later Mr, Chenery bought The
Meadow and began racing and

Blue Drops To Towson;
Takes On ODU Saturday

By JIM MOZINGO

In the past week Washington and
Lee has dropped its record from
6-4 to 6-6. The Generals gave up
a 10-point victory, 74-64, to a tough
Towson State team at home this
past Wednesday, and lost a close
one to the University of North Caro-
lina at Wilmington on the road,
56-54.

The Generals haye a tough week
ahead of them with Emory & Henry
at E&H on Wednesday and Old
Dominion at home on Saturday. The
Old Dominion game should be an
interesting one since this team is
coming off a two game streak
against major college opponents.
They defeated two Ohio teams,
Dayton and Xavier, and — should
pose a formidable obstacle for
the Generals. Especially’ gonsider-
ing members of the team
have come down with the flu in the
past week.

The flu may account for the sub-
par performance of Junior Skip

others are concerned over W&L’s
traditional apathy in supporting the
basketball team. Here | think it is
also worthy to note that though
the Generals have been very dis-
appointing most of the season, they

have provided some outstanding
basketball on occasion.
It seems doubtful that Skip

Lichtfuss, leading the team with a
19.3. ppg. average, will see much
action in the game Wednesday night
against Emory and Henry. Skip is
still being bothered by the flu bug

For those interested in trying out

most have been exposed to it,

No matter how W&L does this
week they have a week ahead of
them which should be equally, if
not more tiring than this one, For
next week the Generals play three
games ‘at home against three tough
schools, Rollins College on Monday
night, Madison on Wednesday night
and Virginia Union on Saturday.
No doubt Coach Canfield and his
squad will be happy to get out of
the month of January.

Some final notes: Bo
who started the season at forward

W&L Swimmers Keep Winning;
Take On VMI At Home ‘Tonite |

By CLIF OVERCASH

Washington.and Lee’s swim team,
home from a successful road trip
where they defeated Baltimore Loy-
ola 60-50 and Seton Hall 55-40, and
upped their record to 5 and 1, face
Davidson and powerful V.M.I. to-
night in a double dual meet in
Doremus Gymnasium at 8:00. The
Generals, on their way to one of
their best seasons in recent years,
have only lost to U.Va. However,
V.M.I. poses a formidable threat,
having lost only one man from a
team that beat W&L twice last year
and finished third in the State Meet.
W&L Head Coach Bill Stearns

 

candidly admits that “we'll have to
swim extremely well to beat them.”

V.M.I. boasts strong f{reestylers,
in Rich Brown and Lang ‘Meem,
who, incidentally, is the younger
brother, of former W&L swimmer
Bert Meem. The Generals will have
to counter with strong performances
from Billy Cogar, Steve Erickson,
Robbie Searles, and Jim Howard.

Cogar has qualified for the nationals

in both the one and three meter
diving, and sports a perfect record
in one meter competition. Searles
has been improving every meet, and
has recently broken Billy Ball's

school record in the 200 individual
medley. Ericksoh broke Ball’s rec-

 

orgy the 100 yard backstroke on
hi§ way tog qualifying for the na-
tionals, ant highlighting .tonight’s
meet should be a return match be-
tween himyand V.M.I.’s Bob Cun-
nigham. Earlier this year they tied,
and the electronic timer awarded
the rice to Erickson by a fraction
of a second,

Davidson, under a new head
coach, will be bringing a young
team to Lexington, and they should
add to what will be one of the best
home meets here this season.

The Generals will close out Janu-
ary with meets on the 25th against
Roanoke and Lynchburg, and on the
27th against William and Mary.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Jack Paar Resurrected Monthly

(Continued trom page 3)

whatever it is that Paar thinks he is
proving,

The sad thing is that without his
hypersensitive egomania, Jack Paar
is an appealing talk show host.

He is an intense person on the
air, desperately wanting to entertain
his audience. This intensity mai-
fests itself in a sort of bumbling,
jerky, but warmly human manner.
He interrupts himself as well as his
guests to insert mangled  adlib
sentences, typically preceded by: “On
my honor,” “This is the truth,” or
“You must believe me.”

No one can question his frantic
desire to be loved. It is a refresh-
ing contrast to the careless style of
his NBC successor, Johnny Carson,
who is away almost as much as he
is hosting the “Tonight Show.”

Paar knows how to pull together
what for another would be a hope-
lessly amorphous nightmare. When
it appeared that one of last week’s
shows was completely out of hand,
Paar reversed the momentum with
the remark, “Think of me as some-
body’s uncle who drinks too much
and is doing the best he can.”

Paar at his best is something that
Carson will never approach. Who
else could have introduced Jane
Mansfield with “Here they are...”
But his best came rarely last week.

The old master has something else
that neither Carson nor Cavett can
ever obtain: his acquaintances and
friendships with the notables of the
period of his original broadcasts.

Included in this distinguished
crowd are people like Oscar Levant
and Peter Ustinov who both ap-
peared last week on film. They are
people who are fascinating in their
own right, regardless of the boom-
ing nostalgia trade,

In a segment rebroadcast from his
weekly NBC show (after leaving
the “Tonight Show”), Levant, per-

haps the most famous hypochondriac
of our time told Paar what he did
for exercise, “I stumble, then I fall
on my face.”

The “live” guests on this past
week—Johnathan Winters, David
Halberstam, Truman Capote—were
not unexpected, but interesting.
There were a few zonkers, such as
country singer Loretta Lynn.

Perhaps the biggest shock was
seeing Peggy Cass as the sidekick
announcer, Is she Hugh Downs in
drag?

Predictably, there were the home
movies on the new show, but kept
to reasonable lengths and not about
totally uninteresting subjects. (The
absence so far of Paar’s daughter,
Randy, is evidence of singularly
good judgment on the part of some-
one).

Paar is hardly the most educated
man on television. He has said that
one of the reasons that he hired
Dick Cavett as a comedy writer
was because he revelled in having
a Yale graduate on his staff. Last
week, he unashamedly admited to
the ultimate intellectual sin: Paar
likes muzak.

No doubt, his lack of formal
education is one factor contributing
to Paar’s vaulting paranoia, But
the talk show audience does not
want a pedant for a host any more
than it wants an illiterate.

What it does want is a_ witty
urbane, and occasionally self-effac-
ing showman,

The “I-don’t-do-anything” line
belies the fact that Paar, when not
preoccupied by his own ego, is the
proper combination of the above.

Paar has three weeks to plan a
comeback from last week's come-
back. If the new new Jack Paar
can discard at least some of the self-
pity of both the original and the
new Jack Paar, he may be worth
watching.

duly harsh with Mr. Gray since
he then went on to illuminate a
campus truism: “.. . in a ‘go to the
back of the bus’ manner, Gray
underscored his position by asking
if any EC members were non-fra-
ternity.”

It is not the purpose of this
letter to offer suggestions but rather
to identify the underlying implica-
tions of this hilarious meeting. If
we have misunderstood the true
meaning of this debate, we offer our
most humble apologies to the
Olympians and suggest that the re-
porting of The Ring-tum Phi leaves
something to be desired, If this is
indeed the case, we further suggests
that Mr, Paukert send his reporters
to the third floor of Reid Hall
where tutoring sessions will gladly
be arranged at no charge.

left-over “sno-cones” could be served

2:00—A closing convocation held
in Lee Chapel for all 1400 students
and their dates would mark the close
of the fun-filled weekend. After-
wards casualties of the past merri-
ment are dug out of drifts, those
having frozen to death solemnly
buried, the survivors fondly de-
posited in the Infirmary, Study time
begins at 8:00, (1 hour later than
on weeknights), and the school
winds down, now girding itself for
another academic week.

So there it is. If we want it,
our DUBYANEL Winter Carnival
is within our grasp. Granted, plan-
ning will be difficult, but with every-
one pitching in, | think the dream
could solidify into a reality.

Ponder the possibilities fellow stu-
dents, picture those smug Dart-
mouth Ivy leaguers gaping in peal-
ous amazement from between their
Head skis and from beneath their
ice grottoes as we get the Playmate
of the Month to come South! What
a coup! What do you say?

Then again, if you've got to study
for some test coming up, | under-
stand, Thanks anyway...

New Married Student Housing

(Continued from page 1)
struction costs have skyrocketed,
and dealing with HUD have been
painfully slow.

The University is now planning
to offer Virginia construction com-
panies a much larger package deal,
the cost of which would be ap-
proximaetly 1.5 million dollars, In
addition to the 30 units at Liberty
Hall other units would be built for
single students in the Weeds creek
area just northeast of Wilson Field,
The combined projects would house
168 students,

It all depends, of course, on where
students are going to want to live
five years from now, Should the
University build more housing for

was not more administration sup-
port.

The head of the Student Recruit-
ment Committee, Larry Evans, was
also present to report on the activi-
ties of his group and their plans
for the upcoming Lee Scholarship
Weekend, He acknowledged that his
committee did not receive funds
from the admission office, but did
have use of th coffice’s facilities and
their cooperation.

Jeff Twardy suggested that
W&L—particularly the W&L ad-
ministration—put forth a much

greater effort into the recruiting pro-
gram, The senior law representative
also. wondered why certain pro-
grams were allocated student body
funds, particularly the Film Com-
mittee,

The EC also passed unanimously
a resoluiton to place signs in the
Game Room of the University Cen-
ter stating that vandalization of the
pinball machines and other equip-
ment could be considered an Honor
System violation. The action was
taken in response to reports that
costly damage had been done to
these machines and that W&L stu-
dents were doing the damage.

single students, it faces the problem
of having to compete with land-
lords within Lexington and outside
the city. According to surveys Par-
sons has taken over the past five
years, students are moving increas-
ingly to the countryside.

Parsons noted that the University
may not have to build at all. A
private developer, who wishes to re-
main unidentified, has a plan to
construct a housing complex in Lex-
ington open only to “family units”,
that is single persons living alone or
whole families. This development
would consist of 100 units funded
in part by HUD. Families with
limited income could obtain rent
subsidies.

However the problem is resolved,
Hillside Terrace may have obtained
a stay of execution, for the time
being at least. That is good in a
way. One can't help the feeling,
while listening to Walt blithly de-
scribe the living conditions, that the
“Buy Bonds” spirit has somehow
persisted there.

Ice Hockey in Roanoke:

Cruel, Frozen, Exciting

averaging about 2 games a week,
regularly draws crowds of approxi-
mately 2,000. Student discount cards
can be had for nothing and are
good for 75 cents off any adult
ticket.

For those who have never been
to a hockey game it is a unique
experience. Hockey is the fastest
game in sports. It is full of quick
starts and even quicker stops, as
bodies go flying into the boards,
onto the ice, and into each other.
The game is characterized by fights
as frequently as goals, and to the
novice observer, it appears to be a
melange of utter senselessness.

Yet hockey is a game of grace, of
intense excitement, once the rules
are understood. It is a game with
its own special breed of hero. It is
full of of mames like Stachnick,
Paiement, and St. Sauver, but also
has its Smiths and Sullivans. Hockey
is three bruising periods of blood,
sweat and cheers.

If the Virginia sports fan is in-
terested in something new, let him
try hockey. A trip to Roanoke will
give him a glimpse of some good
and exciting hockey and might help
to create another fan. So get a ticket
and go see the Roanoke Valley
Rebels play. Take your friends and
discover hockey.

In just the past year, The Meadow
has produced Riva Ridge, winner
of last year’s Kentucky Derby, and
Secretariate, recently named Horse
of the Year for 1972.

Some of Mr. Chenery’s other well
known horses include Cicada and
First Landing (26th and 27th on
the list of all-time money winners
in the world) as well as Hill Prince,
named Horse of the Year in 1950,

Mr. Chenery was instrumental in

named him trustee emeritus, and in
a resolution characterized him as
“a leader of integrity, wisdom and
