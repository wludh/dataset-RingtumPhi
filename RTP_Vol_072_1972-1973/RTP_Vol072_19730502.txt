Film Committee Presents
Kazan’s ‘East of Eden’

Another movie cult hero comes
to the screen of duPont auditor-
ium tonight at 7:30 as the W&L
Film Committee presents the first
major film performance of James
Dean in Elia Kazan’s “East of
Eden.” Admission is free.

Tne prototype for the anguished
youthful actor, Dean was the first
mummer of the silver screen to
be identified with what was to
become “the doubts and protests
of modern American youth.” Ac-
cording to songwriter Don Me-
Lean in “American Pie,” even
Dylan made it “with a coat he
borrowed from James Dean.”

Based on John Steinbeck’s novel
about a family living in Califor-
nia in 1917, “East of Eden” ex-
ploits the Cain and Abel myth to
explore the mores and relation-
ships of, in, and about an Ameri-
can family on the threshold of
bustling days and a new United

States. Yet the hero of this tale
remains the “rebel without a
cause” transplanted from _ post-

WW II to pre-WW I America.

Gulf Oil Donates $2500
For Student Recruitment

The Washington and Lee Stu-
dent Recruitment Committee has
received a grant of $2,500 for dis-
advantaged students from the
Gulf Oil Corporation.

One of the functions of the Stu-
dent Recruitment Committee is to
raise funds for financial aid for
underprivileged students. Gary
Avery, who led the fund-raising
project, said that it had sent out
nearly 70 requests to philanthro-
pic foundations but had not count-
ed on an immediate response from
the Gulf Oi! Corporation.

Larry Evans, who heads the
committee, contacted the Gulf Oil
Corporation over spring break
and it responded immediately.

Avery said that this grant was
the first Gulf Oil has given to an
eastern college other than to those
having sizeable constituencies of
alumni employed by the corpora-

OUTLOOK AND REVIEW

Watergate: Point and Counterpoint

A View from the Left

To those of us who place ourselves anywhere left of that
pseudo-existant point we call the center of the political spect-
rum, Watergate has now seemingly become a sit-back-and-
watch affair where we can praise the Washington Post for a
fine job of investigative reporting and where we can level al-
most any blasts we wish at the Nixon administration.

Yet, we cannot really sit back and watch, for the whole scan-
dal unveils a deep insight into America’s politics, an insight not
only into the G.O.P. or Mr. Nixon, but into the entire scope of
the American political scene. There are many examples of this,
but only two are needed to at least suggest this insight.

Firstly, we must turn to Mr. Nixon’s Monday night chat,
in which he accepted full responsibility for any involvement
his administration has in Watergate. The President blamed the
scandal on the fact that he did not run his 1972 campaign di-
rectly; rather, he let his aides and friends do the campaigning
for him,

Mr. Nixon's campaign in 1972 was an experiment, as Frank
Mankiewicz keenly noted here in the Contact program, in the
new politics—it was a campaign without the candidate. Mr.
Nixon was simply sold to the American public without ever
having to concern himself with the public or with the campaign
which was selling him. And this is what caused Watergate.

Conceding the point that Mr. Nixon has at least a minimal
set of scruples, we see that if he had watched his campaign
closely, Watergate simply could not have happened. Mr. Nixon
would have squashed any scandalous bugs, hopefully, before
they flew past the screen door, so to speak.

So, the question of Mr. Nixon’s entire 1972 campaign as
an experiment is brought up here, and we see it has miserably
failed. Indeed, other Nixonian experiments—his administrative
structure and his view of the loftiness of the American presi-
dency high above Congress and the people—may also be shown
to have failed by the implications of Watergate. We only hope
that Mr. Nixon now realizes this and that he takes appropriate
measures to at least rid America of two of his experiments still
being conducted—his administrative structure and his views
of the Presidency’s loftiness—before their failure is implanted
permanently upon American politics in a manner similar to his
campaign.

But as we noted earlier, the implications of Watergate go
far beyond Mr. Nixon, and we cite the case of the typical liberal
as an example of this.

It is sorrowful to note that the Post, for all its fine reporting
and continued pressure upon the scandal, was quite alone in its
war against the administration.

For sure, liberals were attacking the administration daily
during the campaign, but their attacks bore only a half-hearted
“shame, shame” compared to the Post's blasts. The liberals were
content to merely imply that something was buggy about
Watergate, without really worrying about finding out what
that something was.

Thank God for the Post, ye complacent liberals. While you
only lashed the Nixon administration, the Post was finding out
why you were lashing it, and that paper was lending some
credibility to your lashing. The point is that, without the Post
and other papers risking their necks to find out the truth, the
Watergate Seven would simply have been dismissed as the
Watergate Seven, without any consideration as to the revision
of the number involved, Certainly, investigations were con-
ducted, but it was the Post and other papers that made an in-
depth investigation worth even considering. The liberals have
little to be proud of when one looks at the whole scope of impli-
cations made by Watergate.

We hope that these two example of the far-reaching implica-
tions of Watergate actually define these implications and their
scope. And we hope that Watergate has not only indicated
some (but not all) the flaws of Mr. Nixon, his administration,

Cabaret—This Week at the Cinema 1

and the G.O.P., but also countless other flaws in our entire
political system—from the current structure of political cam-
paigning in America to—yes, even the basic spinelessness of the
American liberal.

PJ.L.

Looking from the Right

The dams have finally broken wide open at the Watergate,

flooding the White house itself and washing away Messrs.
Haldeman, Erlichman, and Dean in its tide. Presumably, John
Mitchell saw the storm coming late last year, when he abandon-
ed ship as head of the President's Re-election Committee.

Whether the President himself will weather this tempest is

yet to be determined. Despite Miss Jean Dixon’s much-touted
prophecy, there seems to be no way that he can come out of this
mess with a stronger reputation. The very best he can hope for
is for his name to be cleared, in the subsequent proceedings,
from any direct knowledge of or implication in the break-in.
As Mr. Nixon admitted in his television address Monday night,
the very fact that his administration is involved makes him re-
sponsible for any wrongdoing. No matter what occurs as facts
unfold in the coming months, Mr. Nixon will be held account-
able for Watergate, if not at the polls, at least in the history
books.

His speech on Monday night was not very revealing and

was replete with typical Nixonian bathos. But in its rhetori-
cal nature and style it was not any different from any other
speech the President has given before the cameras during his
tenure in office. Nearly all of the
whether on the trip to China or the mining of Haiphong, have
been marked by the same kind of hyperbole and patriotic cliches.
It is easy for us, with all our flippant sophistication, to laugh at
the President's rhetorical overkill. But when the President says
“God Bless America,” who can say with certainty that he
doesn't mean just that?

President's announcements,

Beneath all the self-justification of the President's speech,

there were some hopeful signs. For one thing, he extended an
olive branch to the press, praising them for their “vigorous”
pursuit of the truth in the Watergate story. Secondly, he had
admiring words for the “courageous” judge who is presiding
over the case, John Sirica, who is himself a Republican appoin-
tee. And finally, Mr. Nixon pledged himself to a full disclosure
of the facts, however, painful to himself and the administration.
Whether he keeps that pledge remains to be seen, but the ap-
pointment of Elliot Richardson to be Attorney-General seems
to be a step in the right direction; though he may not have the
independence of an outside prosecutor. Mr. Richardson is un-
deniably a man of ability and integrity.

The vital point to be remembered is this: no matter how

this whole sordid affair is resolved, we all lose. The implica-
tion of the scandal go far beyond Mr. Nixon’s personal reputa-
tion or that of the GOP. For those of us who feel there has been
much to admire in both the foreign and domestic policies of the

President, the Watergate affair is utterly debiltating. Tragic-

Nixon's favor from Day One.

ally, we stand to see the real and important accomplishments of
the administration completely obscured by some bungled poli-
tical antics perpetrated in a campaign that was decided in Mr,

This is not to reduce the harsh significance of the Watergate

debacle; it must be cleared up-—-unsparingly and rapidly—to re-
store confidence in the Presidency, But no one really stands any-
thing to gain by smug prejudgment before the facts are in; the
only ones who can rejoice at the current developments are those
professional Nixon haters who operate not out of a deep sense
of moral outrage, but rather out of their own ideological zeal.
For these people, even if the President is ultimately absolved,
it would simply be further proof of his “trickiness.”

As we said, in an affair like this, none of us come out smell-

ing like roses.

Letters To The Editor

Dear Sir:

This letter is written with the
trembling hand and_ throbbing
head of what was once a great
athlete. I was always popular at
school because of my prowess on
the athletic fields, and there were
days when I would literally have
to sprint through the parking lot
at my high school to make it to
my car before the hordes of girls
engulfed it and started rocking it
back and forth on its packed-up
shocks. But now all that is gone,
I sit friendless, confused and on
the verge of rash acts. Why? Ill
tell you why!! It’s those damned
new rules for volleyball, that’s
why!!

When the intramural volleyball
season started, I knew that it
would be my finest hour. I had
been the star of repeated frater-
nity practice sessions and my
brothers quickly coined the nick-
name “Spike King” for me. I had
amazing control over the mam-
mary-like V-ball and my incred-

ible quickness stunned lesser play-
ers, The first night of competition
was a different story. New,
strange and utterly exasperating
calls rang in my ears like “two-
handed dig”, “two-handed spike”,
and “you're under the net buddy.”
Point after point was lost because
of these strange alien rules, and
I felt my face flush with hot
shame as I heard two co-eds gag-
ging with laughter in the corner
of the old gym. What happened to
the normal, descent, American
rules we all know and love? Why
have — bleeding-hearts liberals
foistered these leftish changes on
us? I think there’s something
fishy going on here. Listen, I’m
not sour grapes or anything, but
I'd like to be informed about the
whole thing, if you know what I
mean, Next thing you’ know,
they're going to exempt pitchers
from batting in the All-American
sport of baseball!
Warily yours,
Steven Corbin '73

Sundry Views Mark
Prisons Conference

The Virginia Conference on Cor-
rections wound up a_ three-day
stint here Saturday, and the only
thing everybody agreed upon was
that the current American “cor-
rectional program”’—the current
prison system—has to be chang-
ed.

There was quite a lack of agree-
ment on how it should be chang-
ed. Former U.S. Senator Charles
Ek. Godel! highlighted one stand
taken by several people in his re-
marks to the conference Friday
morning. Goodell called today’s
prison rehabilitation a “fraud,”
but he did concede that the notion
of imprisonment is a valid one.

Godell asked for the “decrimi-
nalization” of the  victimless
crimes such as gambling and pros-
titution when the offense is
against beliefs or standards rath-
er than against individuals or pro-
perty.

Godell also noted a tendency
towards over-punishment in to-
day's prisons. He said punishment
must be administered without
passion.

Martha Wheeler, head of Ohio's
women's prison, expressed the
view that lawmakers have failed
to keep abreast of changing stand-
ards and moral patterns in soc-
iety. She also said that today’s
prison system is not useless.

John O, Boone, director of the
Massachusetts prison system, said
the most effective rehabilitation
or corrections system can lie out-
side the prison walls. He said soc-
iety must develop other responses
to crimes than just locking a per-
son up. He cited probation as of-
ten being more effective overall
in reform procedures.

Governor Linwood Holton, in a
speech Friday night to the Con-
ference, focused on the problems
of Virginia's prison systems. He
ealled for a shift in the restructur-
ing of the state's corrections in-
stitutions from larger settings to
“Smaller, more diversified treat-
ment units.”

Holton emphasized the need for
individual treatment in the re-
habilitation program. He said Vir-

ginia has made “real progress” in
this direction.

Holton also said he does not
foresee the complete elimination
of prisons in the state’s correc-
tional programs. He noted the ex-
istence of a “small element of so-
ciety” that will have to be isolat-
ed by prisons.

The three-day conference cen-
tered around the theme, “Work-
ing Together in Corrections.”
About 240 prison administrators
and other persons involved in cor-
rections attended the conference.
The conference was brought to
the Washington and Lee campus
by the university's School of Law.

Hollins College:
The Views Of
Returning Girls

All of us who attend academic
institutions are aware of the cri-
ticisms constantly being voiced
concerning the standards of our
schools. In fact, it is the academic
establishment which has fostered
this critical spirit. Many at Wash-
ington and Lee have criticized the
University for being too slow
moving, too static. The students
want coeducation and other re-
forms to be instituted. Although
these changes may be genuine
improvements, what about the
values of the university that are
neglected.

Hollins College is going through
a period of change and reevalua-
tion as is W&L. Hollins is faced
with the problem of a larger and

situation at Hollins. Her article,
“Attrition: The Ones Who Came

of ten students who returned to
Hollins,

One girl stated:

“*l had to leave because | had

Some apparentiv appreciated
Hollins more once they had left
its campus. They left to get a
taste of the real world that was
perhaps missing at Hollins

“*They had it together—social

tegrate the ‘real world’ and aca-
demics at the university, Hollins
makes you study five days and

They found the advantages they
had sought in larger, coeducation

RING-TUM PHI

Emmer Attacks Pollsters,
‘It's WHO You Play!

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s lacrosse team keeps winning
games but dropping in the polls,
and it’s beginning to bug W&L
coach Jack Emmer.

“We didn’t ask to be ranked
fifth (in early and pre-season na-
tional polls),” Emmer said recent-
ly, “but for some reason some
people thought that’s where we
should be ranked. Now, here we
are undefeated (after eight
games), and yet we keep slipping
in the polls.”

From their lofty fifth-place
ranking early in the season, the
Generals later dropped to sev-
enth, and now are eighth in the
two major polls, the Associated
Press rankings chosen by vote of
lacrosse coaches, and the Balti-
more Sun poll, selected by that
paper’s sportswriters. (The Gen-
erals are back up to seventh this
week).

Emmer feels it’s not “how you
play, but who you play” that has
a lot to do with the poll rankings.
“If you are a ‘Big Five’ school
(John Hopkins, Maryland, Vir-
ginia, Army, Navy), your results
against another Big Five school
play a minimal role in the rank-
ings. Look at Army’s 23-8 loss to
Maryland, or Navy’s 14-7 loss to
Maryland, Both Army (No. 5) and
Navy (No. 4) are still ranked very
high.

“It seems that anybody who
simply plays John Hopkins (No.
1) or Maryland (No. 2) enhances
their poll standing regardless of
the outcome.

“But if you are not a Big Five
schoo] and you win a close game
against a good team, you drop in
the rankings,” Emmer continued.
He cited as examples W&L’s one-
goal victories over 14th-ranked
Cornell (national champion two
years ago and Ivy League champs
last year), Carling Lacrosse Club
(last year’s national club cham-
pions), Towson (ranked 10th) and
Princeton (19th). The Generals
also have defeated Washington
College (16th) and ‘North Carolina
(20th).

“They are all very good teams,
and we won, yet we lose ground
in the polls. I don’t understand it.”

While not meaning to down-
grade those ranked above W&L,
Coach Emmer feels his Generals
should be higher. “I feel we could
more than hold our own against
at least five of the seven teams
rated over us,” he said. “I feel we
can play with any team in the
country.”

The Generals

schedule, no. 3 Virginia, last

pions, who will close out the regu-
lar season at W&L on May 13.

Track Is 5-1, Two Records Set

Two new school records and

dash, the team has compiled a
5-1 dual meet record and a sixth
place finish in the VCAA Tourna-
ment,

Fallis established the new
school mark in the discus at 147
feet, 2 inches against Roanoke
mid-way through the season. Al-

though short of that distance in
the VCAA’s, he captured a first
for the team. The following Tues-
day he scored W&L’s only points
in the state meet with a fourth
place. He ranks as a top contend-
er in the upcoming CAC cham-
pionships.

The 440 vard relay team broke
the old standard with its third
place finish at the VCAA meet.
Paced by John Newmann and Phi-
fer Helms, the team raced to a
43.3 clocking, finishing behind
Virginia State and Hampton In-
stitute. Helms also starred by
winning the 220 yard dash in 22.1,
a tenth of a second ahea dof the
next two finishers.

Stickmen Roll On; UNC and W&M Fall

By PAUL CAVALIERE

The NCAA-bound Washington
and Lee Generals finished another
week with two impressive wins,
one over North Carolina, which
was ranked 20th at the time, the
other at the expense of the Wil-
liam and Mary Indians,

The Blue beat UNC by the
score of 14-9, but the game was
not as Close as the score indicated.
Before the reserves were put in
the fourth quarter, the Generals
maintained a 13-4 lead. The scor-
ing was well distributed with
Sam Englehart (3 goals) and
Bryan Chasney (1 goal, 3 assists)
leading the field. The game was
highlighted by the defensive per-
formance of goalie Skeet Chad-

wick and defensive man Don Ea-
venson who shut off UNC’s super
attackman Bruce Ledwith.

The William and Mary game
turned out just as expected, with

the Generals jumping out to a
big lead, 9-0 at the end of the
first quarter, and 12-1 at half-
time. From this point the Gen-

erals coasted home to a 23-5 win
with the subs playing a good part
of the second half. The Generals
displayed some excellent passing
and some very unselfish
work. Once again Skeet

Wilson, Spicer Are Co-Winners

Of Academy of Poets Award

Robert S. Wilson, a senior from
Brownsburg, and John T. Spicer,
a sophomore from Roanoke, have
been named co-winners of this
years’ Academy of American
Poets Poetry Prize at Washington
and Lee. They will divide the $100
award.

Mr .Wilson’s entry, “First Im-
pressions,” was a free verse poem
about a bittersweet love affair.
Mr. Spicer’s poem, written in
rhymed quatrains, was an evoca-
tion of loss of an old bridge, and
its replacement by a new one that
marred the environment, It was
titled, “Bridge in the Country.”

The judges of the contest, Dab-
ney Stuart and Edwin Craun of
the English Department, express-
ed regret that more of Washing-
ton and Lee’s student poets did
not enter the contest.

its moral bankruptcy. Germany is
