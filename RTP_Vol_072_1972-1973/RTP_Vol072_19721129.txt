EC Makes Loan

For New Journal

By MIKE

The Executive Committee, meet-
ing in a two hour session Monday,
tackled such varied problems as al-
locating money for a new Com-
merce newspaper, organizing — the
Plan and Development Committee,
and determining their view of dis-
cussing exams during the examina-
tion period,

Bill Merrill, EC vice-president
presented his proposal for a Com-
merce school newspaper that would
be chiefly composed of articles writ-
ten by prominent businessmen, poli-
ticians and commercial executives.
The purpose of the paper Merrill
noted, would be to fulfill the need
for communication between students
and the businessmen and _ politicians
on important topics of the present
and prospective solutions for the
future. Merrill proposed that the
paper would monetarily self-suffici-
ent, but like many other projects
needed money to get off the ground.
Afier an hour of heated debate,

the EC turned down the solicitation
for a $500 grant but decided to
make a loan payable three years

after the first publication date.

was revamped, with its members
now consisting of the four under-
class presidents, the law school
president, and a chairman; Paul

A New Part of Foreign Studies Program

Seminar In England Offered

In addition to the already ¢s-
tablished programs in France,
Spain, Germany, and Africa, two
new foreign study courses are ap-
pearing in the curriculum this year
—one in England, the other in Ja-
pan. This week, we report on the
plans for the trip to Great Britain;
the plans for the Japan study will
be discussed here next week, —Ed.

Great Britain will be the site of
a new foreign study program to be
offered by the Washington and Lee
English Department during — the
Spring Term. The course is a semi-
nar in which the topic will be rotat-
ed from year to year, dealing with
some specific aspect of British litera

The addition of the two Spring

brings the total of foreign study
programs offered by Washington
and Lee to six. Programs are also
offered for study in France, Spain,
Germany, and East Africa.

The growth of the university's
foreign studies program in recent
years is a product of the university's
decision to follow a 12-12-6 semes-
ter plan. One of the expressed pur-
poses of the switch to such a semes
ter plan was to develop an exten-
sive program in foreign studies,

The French and Spanish programs
ure offered by the Department of
Romance Languages, while the Ger-
man program is offered by the Ger-
man Department. All three courses
basically involve both indepedent re-
search and intensive contact with
the language and the culture of the
country.

All three programs are open to
upperclassmen, and freshmen may
be eligible. Students in the programs

' Pre-Trial Hearing

Is Set

For Indicted Students

All ten students arrested two
weeks ago on charges of distribut-
ing various drugs have been released
on bond. The fourteen defendants,
students and locals, arrested as a
result of the year-and-a-half long
investigation must now wait until a
December 6 hearing at which a trial
date will be set.

The Washington and Lee students
have returned to classes, and, ac-
cording to Dean of Students Lewis
John, it is uncertain when (if any)
disciplinary action will be taken
against them by the university.

“Assuming the trial comes during
the academic year,” Dean John
said, “the Student Control Com-
mittee will, in all likelihood, con-
sider the cases after that time.”

John said that the reason for the
delay of disciplinary action was pri-
marily a practical one, It would be
impossible, he emphasized, for the
Student Control Committee to com-
pile evidence while the civil cases
were pending in the courts.

Several local lawyers have been
preparing for the defense of the
students. One group of five or six
students was successful in getting
their bond reduced to $5,000 cash
and $10,000 in property, for the

The East African study program,
sponsored by the Politics Depart-
ment, was instituted last year. The
program is offered in alternate
years, and any student who has
taken Politics 101 is eligible. Stu-
dents in the program will investi-
gate political, economic, and cul-
tural aspects of the young African
nations.

however, may choose to request a

Dean John said that there has
been no precedent concerning stu-
dents indicted for drug distribution,
and, therefore, it would be impos-
sible to predict what action, if any,
would be taken by the university.
Students disciplined for possession
of marijuana and drugs in univer-
sity housing have, at most, been put
on social probation for a certain
period.

The Student Control Committee,
made up entirely of students, will
have jurisdiction in the matter,
though its decision will be subject to
review by the Student Affairs Com-
mittee, consisting of an equal fac-
ulty-student representation.

Christmas Party, Combo
Planned For The Cockpit

As a final fling before exams, the
University Center Committee has
planned a number of programs and
activities for the week ahead.

The traveling pair, Lenny and
Joelle, have been engaged for a live
concert in the Cockpit tomorrow
night, beginning at 9 p.m. On tour
along the Eastern Seaboard, the cou-
ple sings a mixture of folk music,
ballads, and mountain music. “They
appeared on campus last winter to
a large audience in the Cockpit,”
stated Ken Lane, “and we are look-
ing forward to their return.” Ad-
mission is free, Lane added.

On Tuesday, December 5, the
“Traveling Rainbow” jug band will
be in the Cockpit for a repeat en-
gagement. Led by student Al Tharpe
and by David Pelliciaro, son of Pro-
fessor Pelliciaro, the group will be-
gin at 7:30 p.m.

|OUTLOOK and REVIEW

November 29, 1972

The Drug Bust

By now, Everyone knows about the Bust—the
never really expected would come. While it didn't exactly
clean out the drug traffic in Lexington, it certainly did result
in a traumatic experience for ten Washington and Lee stu-

one we

dents and their friends,

Since the trial date for those indicted has not even been
set, it would be most presumptuous for us to toss off our opi-
nions on the case.

Suffice it to say the arrests did not exactly do wonders for
our suffering “Town and Gown” relations. The fact is that the
four state troopers who acted as undercover agents would not
have brought their operation here without the enthusiastic
invitation from local officials.

It is generally conceded that a couple of other students
have made quite a lot of money off drug exchange, but the
counts gathered against the current defendants over the fil-
teen-month investigation do not reveal any “big-time” opera-
tors among them. And, the story that the troopers purchased
from and smoked pot with the students has left a sour taste in
more than one mouth on this campus.

If any message can be culled from this experience, it is
this: the days of in loco parentis are truly and finally over, A
student cannot feel himself cloistered and immune from out-
side prosecution. And finally, every effort must be continued
to keep drugs out of university housing, to avoid an even more
frightening invasion.

On Milking The Alumni

Just before we all took for the Thanksgiving holidays, the
University sponsored its fifth annual conference for what was
termed as a “select group of alumni.” The lofty purpose, as
stated in the program brochure, was “to provide better com-
iunication and understanding between alumni and members
of the University family—faculty, students, and administra-
tion,”

Of course, most W&L students, being the cynical rascals
that they are, probably thought this was nothing but a ploy to
milk the alumni for some development cash, Crotehety, old
alumni would be herded around by a carefully-picked cadre
of conventionally-dressed student leaders—all the right an-
swers would be given to all those silly alumni-type questions.
And after they had been humored and reassured, the alumni
would go back home and send checks flowing back to campus.

But, lo and behold, this conference was different. To be
sure, a primary goal of the administration during this gather-
ing was to impress the alumni with what we were doing here,
so that they would leave Lexington feeling generous toward
our ambitious fund-raising campaigns. These alumni, not be-
ing a particularly stupid lot, realized this.

Yet there were many aspects of this conference which
demonstrated a sincere effort to avoid the hideous scenario
outlined above. First, the alumni came from all parts of the
country, from all sorts of professions—in short, were any-
thing but a purely upper-crust source for contributions, Sec-
ondly, many of the students invited to meet with the alumni
had no special excuse (i.¢., campus officer, editor, ete.) but
were there to participate as students.

What was really astonishing about this particular confer-
ence was the attentiveness and interest shown by the alumni
involved. Of course, since they arrived hot on the heels of a
drug bust and since many of these men had not been back to
Lexington since coats and ties disappeared, many of the ex-
pected questions got asked,

But, by and large, the seminars and discussions did not
dwell on these issues, but focused on a whole variety of prob-
lems, from black recruitment to upperclass housing.

lf any major conclusion could be drawn from these ses
sions, it was that the administration is failing to utilize these
energetic graduates to anywhere near their potential. For
example, during one discussion a couple of students were com-
plaining that lack of funds precluded any real progress in the
black recruitment program, One alumnus spoke up and asked,
why not contact the area alumni, and have them bring the pro
pectiv e student to campus? Several other alumni, one after
another, proceeded to offer his help in working in their local
ties with recruitment and admissions projects,

Dining Out In Greater Lexington

Good Times Await At “The Quid’

Many new students and townies
have begged us to provide an hon-
est survey of the culinary delights
to be found in the area. To answer
this plea, we begin a series of col-
umns on “Dining Out In Greater
Lexington.” Staff writer Jess Reeves
visited the Central Lunch (affec-
tionately known as “the Quid”) just
before Turkey Day and files our
inaugural report. —Ed.

By J. REEVES

You enter the door to the noise
and flashing lights of the pinball
machines that flank the entrance.
The place is filled with Pikas, mis-
cellaneous students, a few cadets and
fewer townies. Behind the counter
are cases upon cases of Old Mil
selling at $1.60 a six, Over the milk
cooler stands a white plastic duck.
All this tells you that you're in the
right place, This, in all its typical
Lexington splendor, is the Quid.

The early Rockbridge decor might
lead one to believe that the Quid
is just like any other townie hang-
out but this is far from true, As the
proprietor, Duck, will readily tell
you, Central Lunch caters to the
students of Washington and Lee
University rather than to the local-
yokel population.

This makes for a singularly high-
type clientel consisting primarily of
Red Square residents. The intimate
atmosphere and familiar patrons
make the visitor feel right at home,
assuming that he has lived in Lex-
ington or an equivalent Hillbilly
haven all his life.

If the homey atmosphere is not
appealing in itself, there are always
Mr. and Mrs. Duck to make you
comfortable, Isn't that reassuring!
Mr. Duck is truly a friend to any
student who will dare walk through
his door. This man of the people is
always ready to go to bat for a stu-
dent.

In fact, he will do anything for a
patron (short of going into that

kitchen.) In any event, he is usually
there with a beaming smile, willing
and eager to sell somebody a keg
or a case,

Duck and his establishment's de-
cor are sufficient reason for a visit
to the Quid, but if you need more
convincing, consider the well planned
menu, Anything you might order
can be served to your booth in the
twinkling of an eye (and with a
minimum of effort to the staff.) The
service is all that you could hope
for—if you're ravenous, that is.

The best that can be said of the
Central Lunch cuisine is that it is
never monotonous, A Swiss cheese-

burger never tastes the same twice.
It is debatable as to wether the odds
are in your favor when you order,
but the food is always filling, just
like normal food, and occasionally
hot.

Perhaps the Quid’s greatest virtue
is to be found in its moderate prices.
One can comfortably enter its por-
tal with $1.50 and be assured of
dining as well as is possible there.
The steaks are among the cheapest
Lexington has to offer and afford
the best in incisor exercise.

One would be wise to avoid the
chili if the Quid has a rank odor.
Otherwise, one item listed on the

menu is as safe as the next.

All things considered the Quid is
a pretty safe bet when the pocket-
book allows such extravagance. A
cold brew and a smiling Duck as-
sure the visitor the kind of experi-
ence worth writing home about,

Before graduation each and every
student should make a_ point of
dropping in Central Lunch where
good home cooking (providing you
live in a place like Buena Vista) and
hospitality blend in a mixture which
reflects the old charm of Lexington.
Try it any night before twelve and
see what the good life in Lexington
is all about,

 

Duck and Mrs. Duck stand behind the familiar counter as reporter Reeves prepares to dive into a_ typical

“Quid” meal. The Central Lunch is located on Main Street.

Letters To The Editor...

On The Lexington Drug Scare

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

Now that the long threatened
drug bust has finally come, | find
myself writing a letter I hoped |
would never write.

About two years ago we found
out that Lexington would be our
new home. We immediately began
receiving the local newspaper. Since
| was working in drug addict re-
habilitation in New Jersey, | was in-
terested in the news on drugs. The
impression | received was of a
community that for some unfathom-
able reason was trying to convince
myself it had a drug problem.

After our arrival this impression

DISCussion

was strengthened. | observed little
evidence of drug use and no evi-
dence of a drug problem. | feel that
a community has a drug problem
when drug users are committing
crimes under the influence of drugs
or to support their drug purchases,
or when medical problems result
from drug use (¢.g., hepatitis).

Yet everyone in the community
(outside the University, | should
add) seemed to be working them-
selves into hysteria over their “hor-
rible,” “severe,” “growing” drug
problem.

Why? I feel there are two basic
reasons: ignorance and fear. The

problem of ignorance about drugs is
overworked, I agree. Yet a local
pharmacy distributes a drug fact
sheet filled with what can most
charitably be called inaccuracies.

People make little or no differen-
tiation between marajuana and her-
oin. Marijuana is blamed for a large
variety of social ills, like school fai-
lure. When I was in school (not all
that long ago), smoking cigarettes
and drinking alcohol were blamed
for the same social ills. Smoking
cigarettes can give you cancer or
heart disease, alcohol ruins your
liver and marijuana has no proven
adverse effects, Yet only marajuana
is illegal.

When one points this out, one is
told that it’s against the law and,
therefore, it must be bad. Thus ig-

The Dead are still on their way
up, and they're determined to take
us with them. This is the best music
they've made since the first Live

the best of their loose, almost jazz-
like manner from that original live
album with the cosmic-country sound
they had been into since. The re-
cording is also excellent. No
screams, actually litthe applause. But
if | had heard them play this music
live, | wouldn't have been making
much noise, either, They're a hard
act to follow

The album abounds with excellent
cuts, such as a 13-minute version of
“Truckin which turns into an
open-ended “Epilog” that adds 44%
more minutes to the side. Well worth

The people of Lexington have a
terrific fear of the drug pusher who
is going to seduce their children.
People cannot believe that the
“pusher” might well be their child's
best friend. For what it is worth, |
knew over 300 heroin addicts well
and every one had been introduced
to the drug by one of his good
friends. In addition, most heroin
addicts begin their addiction history
by abusing alcohol. We all know
how well the liquor laws are en-

And so the big bust has come
and Lexington’s “terrible” drug prob-

these drugs are ignored by the au-

community. To those students un-

as a Lexington resident can only of-

are being disjointed and maybe ruin-

Basketball Hopes Are High;
Look Toward U.Va. Saturday

By JIM MOZINGO

Washington and Lee opened up
the 1972-73 basketball season on a
winning note last night as the Gen-
erals nipped University of Pitts-
burgh at Johnstown, 64-61. Skip
Lichtfuss paced the winners with 17
points, while Guy Kerr added 12
and Paul McClure tallied 11,

The Generals will host Randolph-
Macon Thursday night, and will tra-
vel to Charlottesville Saturday to
take on powerful University of Vir-
ginia, Last year U.Va. was ranked
number seven in the nation.

Virginia will start a line-up that
may not be as tough as last years
due to the graduation of four of
last years best. Look for Virginia to
start the 6 ft. 4 in, Parkhill along
with 6 ft. 4 in. Jim Hobgood, 6 ft.
7 in. Dan Gerard, 6 ft. 10 in, Lanny
Stahurski, and 6 ft. 3 in. Andy
Boninti. This team has experience,
but you can expect some useless er-
rors that plague all teams this time
of the year, This could be fairly
close, but look for Virginia to try to
show off in their home opener.

The schedule is tough all season
long, and Coach Verne Canfield
purports to be working toward the
toughest small college schedule in
the country. So here is what W&L
faces the coming season with,

Coach Canfield expects to produce
another winning season, and he pro-
bably will if the team jells; if not
this could be a tough season. Odds
are they'll win more than they lose,
but to do so they must find a man
who can make the key play a la
Daniel, Cartwright, Neer, or they
must establish tremendous team
unity and coordination.

Hoping to fill this gap should be

Weekly Football Contest

returning lettermen Skip Lichtfuss
and Paul McClure. These two will
be looked toward for the leadership
this year. Liohtfuss was second to
Daniel in scoring last year and a
very close third to him in rebound-
ing. MeClure was third in scoring
and first in rebounding,

Both McClure and Lichtfuss should
get help from a promising 6 ft. 9
in, freshman, Norm Kristoff. Since
Lichtfuss moves across court to play
Daniel’s vacated forward, Guy Kerr
will fill Skip’s old forward spot.

Coach Canfield says this team
has the mobility and versatility to
do more on offense and defense
than any other W&L team since he
has been here. Canfield further says
that he can play a tall lineup with
McClure and Kristoff on the base-
line or he can play a faster de-
fensive lineup primarily replacing
Kristoff and going to a single post.
The student of the game can also
look for at least five defenses or
variations, though W&L is. still
basically a man-to-man team, Ex-
pect this team to run and run and
run... They've got experienced
guards in Hatton Smith, Doug Mlel-
lan, and Charlie Strain, and the men
to get it out in McClure and Kris-

Football Ends Long Year

By LEWIS HIXSON

The W&L Generals closed out
their season last Saturday in a man-
ner befitting their play of the en-
tire season. It was a game of ups
and downs for the Blue, but mostly
downs, as Washington turned on
the offense in the second half to
come from behind and grab a 27 to

toff, Also watch for Jerry Porath to
be a part of this combination in
some way.

The bench looks to be reasonably
strong with: Canfield declaring that
even the eleventh and twelfth man
are capable of spot duty. Part of
this bench are two freshmen, Gary
Fitzgerald and John Podgajny, in
addition to Kristoff, These three
you'll get to watch for four varsity
years, so. start recognizing them
now,

Other men to see action this year
should be guards Eugene Perry,
Mike Buchanan, forwards Bo Wil-
liams, and Greg Croghan, and
center Randy Taylor.

This years team should provide
W&L fans with an interesting sea-
son. Will a new talent such as
Daniel, etc. blossom? Will W&L be
able to get it together with so many
men playing new positions? Can the
newcomers fill the gaps that have
been created, as well as overcome
old shortcomings? For the answers
to these questions and many others
check out the 1972-73 W&L basket-
ball program. Maybe you'll get to
tell a friend how you used to make
the play in high school,

7 victory. A spirited W&L defense
in the first half picked off 3 passes
and blocked two punts in giving the
offense many scoring opportunities,
of which they converted but one.
The first and only score came
midway into the first quarter when
the Blue had good field position at
(Continued on page 4)

On the Saturday before Thanksgiving the varsity hoopers took on a
motley crew of alums, It was an exciting contest as the alumni included
former stars such as Mike Neer and Mike Danicl, The scrimmage prov-
ed to be a real test for the 1972 Generals, who edged their older
opponents 87-76, The season will be a tough one, and the Blue will
find out early.

 

Wrestlers Open;
Host M-Harvey

Washington and Lee University
embarks on an ambitious wrestling
program, beginning Wednesday
night when the Generals entertain
Morris Harvey.

The Generals under second-year
coach John Piper have momentum
from last year’s 6-6-1 record, the
first non-losing year in some time.
However, the improved team is off-
set somewhat by a toughened sche-
dule which includes eight University
Division opponents: Duke, Davidson,
North Carolina State, Virginia Mili-
tary, North Carolina, Furman, Vir-
ginia Commonwealth and Bucknell.

Seven lettermen form the nucleus
of the 22-man squad, led by Captain
Jim Stieff, a 150-pound junior from
Baltimore, Md, (Boys Latin). Stieff
was College Athletic Conference
champion at 142 as a freshman and
last year finished third in the CAC
at 150 pounds, posting an overall
7-4-1 mark,

Other top lettermen include 134-
pound Rolf Piranian of Oreland,
Pa. (Germantown Academy), the
CAC champ last year at 126 with
a 9-6 record; 142-pound Bill Mel-
ton of Virginia Beach (Kempsville),
the 134-pound CAC champ and
Outstanding W&L Wrestler as a
freshman; Doug Ford of East Islip,
N.Y. (East Islip) who posted a 10-4-
| mark, reigned as 177-pound CAC
champ last as a freshman and will
wrestle this year at 158. He was the
1971-72 “Outstanding Freshman
Wrestler,”

Three other returning veterans
are 167-pound Sam Lewis of Wheat-
on, Md. (Wheaton), who had a 6-8
mark last year; 1774pound Dave
Powers of Williamsburg (York); and
177- or 190-pound Lanny Rainey

(Continued from page 3)

the Washington 31, following a
blocked punt by Tim Haley, Van
Amburgh gained one up the middle
and then Fluharty passed incom-
plete to Baldwin. This brought up
a 3rd and 9. A Washington offsides
infraction moved the ball to the 25.
Fluharty then dropped back and hit
Conrad on a fly pattern for the
touchdown, Doug Chase’s extra
point was good, and the Generals
led 7-0. That was the extent of the
scoring in the first half. The Gen-
eral defense looked better than it
had all season, and consistently got
the ball for the offense. The Blue
just couldn’t score.

In the second half, the Blue lost
any momentum they might have
had, and practically got blown out
of the staduim. The defense that
looked so strong in the first half
must have gotten tired of giving the
ball to an offense that did nothing,
so they let Washington keep it for
most of the second half. And keep
it they did, as they scored 27 points
on four touchdowns, Two of the
scores came on long bombs that the
Blue secondary had found no trou-
ble in knocking down in the first
half.

Lewis Powell came in to run the
team for most of the second half,
but he also was unable to get the
offense clicking. The main problem
seemed to be the inability of the
Generals to manufacture any kind

of a ground attack. Van Amburgh
was unable to break through for
any sizable gains as he obviously
missed the blocking of counterpart
Jim Farrar, who did not even suit
up. Steve Fluharty had a disappoint-
ing performance in his last game in
a General uniform, He was unable
to move the team despite the many
opportunities offered in the first half
by the defense.

Tim Haley finished out his career
with a fine game as he intercepted a
pass, blocked a punt, and was in on
10 tackles. Marshall Washburn also
intercepted a pass in his final game.
Overall, the game was another dis-
appointment for W&L and can be
added to the list that has made it
a rather poor season. The best game
the Blue played was their first
against Westminster. After that they
never really showed improvement.
They ended with a 3-6 record, losing
their last three encounters.

In looking forward to next year,
a lot will depend on Lewis Powell,
the heir apparent to _ the
Fluharty throne. W&L must be able
to take advantage of breaks like
they received in the first half of
their last contest. Offensively, the
Blue seemed to have all the tools,
but lacked the spirit to blend them
into any kind of an offensive ma-
chine. That winning spirit could
have been the only thing that kept
the Blue from a winning season,
Maybe they can find it next year,

(Continued from page 2)
order to arrive on time.

Next, consider a special case—the
physician. It seems that the Pre-
Meds (of which I am one) at W&L
have the most A-hour classes, But
that’s only for starters, This summer
at the hospital, most doctors arriv-
ed before 7 a.m. to make rounds;
only to return at 6 p.m. to do the
same again.

One doctor in particular I no-
ticed, would spend till midnight at
the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) with
his dying patient, only to return
promptly at 6 a.m. the next morn-
ing to attend his patient.

My point here is, not necessarily
devotion or heroism, but that the
world starts early in the day and
one has to do the same to be part
of it. Consequently, one might as
well get in the habit now of getting
up with the world.

Two more aspects that Mr. Mar-
tin proposes need attention. First,
Mr. Martin states that “He (the
student) will get up as late as pos-
sible.”

True. That's human nature. Yet,
if all classes started at 9 a.m., stu-
dents would still be up at 8:45, com-
plaining that classes should start at
10 a.m.

Next, Mr. Martin suggests more
afternoon classes. People here al-
ready bitch about the fact that
weekends should start on Thurs-
day afternoon. Do you really be-
lieve that more afternoon classes on
Friday will draw more attentive
students?
