Vol. LXXII

By PAUL LANCASTER

Iwo EC law representatives have
set up a committee through the
Executive Committee to investigate
the feasibility and possibility of
establishing two separate administra-
tion systems involving the Honor
System, one within the undergradu-
ate school and one within the Law
School.

[he proposal to set up these
separate administrations systems was
presented to the EC in their regular
Monday night meeting by Law
School Representatives Jeff Twardy
and Henry Jernigan. Twardy said
at the meeting that, according to a
poll taken by the two students, “the
Law School is overwhelmingly in
favor of some kind of autonomy
from the undergraduate school,” at
least in regards to the Honor Sys-
tem.

I'wardy stated that the desire for
this autonomy is felt by all three
classes in the graduate school. He
said, “the law school student body
does not wish to affiliate itself with
the undergraduate school as it now
stands,”

The move by Twardy and Jerni-
gan to ask the EC for a comprehen-
sive study of the situation may be
indicative of growing Law School
sentiment for a complete split from
the undergraduate school. A com-
plete break between the two major
divisions of the university, at least
in the respect of student govern-
ment, might be a move which
would correspond to the transfer
of the Law School students from
lucker Hall to Lewis Hall when the
latter is ready for use.

Ihe committee to study the prob-
lem will consist of eight members.
lwardy and Jernigan will chair the
group, Other members will include
two senior EC members, two under-
class Law School students, and two
underclass of the undergraduate
school. The committee will issue a
report later in the year with sev-
eral recommendations and proced-
ures, basing these on interviews
with members of the student body,
faculty, and administration. Any
conclusions drawn by the commit-

ice recommending a change in the

present administrative system of the
Honor System will then be brought
before the EC for consideration,

One proposal mentioned by
Pwardy and Jarnigan in their pre-
sentation to the EC was the estab-
lishment of a “Hearing Panel” in
the Law School for matters regard-
ing the Honor System. The panel
would consist of five members: two
EC law. representatives, and the
president, vice-president, and sec-
retary of the Law School student
body. Twardy warned, though, that
this proposal for such a hearing
panel was only a suggestion.

The poll, according to Twardy

Law School Proposes
Separate Honor System

and Jernigan, asked for a definite
stand by the law students whether
they were for or against the exist-
ing structure of administering the
Honor System. The two students
said that the student body respond-
ed overwhelmingly against the pre-
sent system.

Jernigan said that most law stu
dents “are unsure as to their posi-
tion regarding the Honor System.”
He stated that “the present system
poses some threats or ambiguity
towards law school students.” The
first-year law student also indicated
that law student sentiment was “not
so much a feeling of alienation as
it is of apprehension,”

T'wardy emphasized that the pro-
posals called for a change in the
administration of the Honor System,
not in the Honor System itself, He

said, “it may be just a big ego
trip, but they (the law’ students)
want to govern themselves. The

undergraduates are not peers of the
law students.”

Twardy and Jernigan also men-
tioned in their proposals the pos-
sibility of altering the present, new-
ly-initiated method of Honor trials,
They offered as possible changes the
introduction of a more active
counseling role in both the EC hear-
ing and the public trial, and the
liberalization of the jury selection
method which, the two Law School
representatives said, “at present is
almost inequitable.”

The two felt that, by the present

Huntley also said that the new

As to a new theatre, Huntley said

is wrapped in this chameleon-con-
duit, which becomes a battleground
and a boudoir, a jail for fuming
Ajax, a tunnel of escape for rant-
ing Thersites. The set is worked
to excellent effect. It is a practical
necessity, for without its outlet for
motion, the diffuseness of the dia-

also a foundation of theme. Brittle

When queried as to how such a colossal failure could have
been perpetrated in the first place, one Christ’s College tutor
could only say: we didn't watch our architects close enough.

Well, if this can happen in Cambridge, England, it can
also happen in Lexington, Virginia. Washington and Lee
has proudly launched one of the most ambitious building
programs in its history. Not only is new housing for under-
graduates and married students in the works, but also a new
law center and a new library are scheduled to appear under
the ten-year program. Those men in the administration re-
sponsible for this planning are faced with a truly unenviable
task; that of providing buildings which are not only practically
suitable but aesthetically suitable as well.

Looking back on our campus’ growth, we have to admit
that their administrative predecessors, by and large, botched
it. John Jordan, the architect of the original collonade build-
ings, obviously had a good thing going with his design of
colonial grace and serenity.

So, everything post-Jordan turned out to be some varia-
tion on a theme of red brick and white columns. Just
the turn of the century, Reid Hall was constructed
Victorian version, bigger than a breadbox but hardly more
attractive. The Science buildings followed suit, until we
attained Mock Collonade at its very worst, duPont Hall.

Preparation for law shoal site is now ‘ts progress.

&L Expands Into The Future

By JESS REEVES

Washington and Lee is becoming
an institution in the front ranks of
progress—as of last February, that
is. At that time President Huntley
announced that the school would
seek $56 million to launch a deve-
lopment program which will change
the face of the school. Buildings
will be thrown up like tepees in the
next few years, and they could turn
out to be as aesthetically pleasing
as the VMI barracks,

Law School

Among the structures to be erect-
ed are a new law school, (Lewis
Hall), a new undergraduate library,
and a little student housing here
and there.

If plans for the Lewis Hall are
any indication one could say that
buildings will be popping up around
here like weeds, rather than flowers.
It belongs to some time beyond
2001,

But the alumni magazine's special
report last May states that the new
building will be a “compatible archi-
tectural expression.” One should ask,
“compatible with what?” The archi-
tects probably had a city on Mars
in mind. The firm responsible for
Lewis Hall is Marcellus Wright,
Cox and Cilimberg of Richmond.
Perhaps a comparison between
Washington College and the new
law school is to be found in that
both contain bricks of some kind,
although the latter is mainly sand-
blasted concrete.

This monster should be functional
on the inside; that is the least one
expects from a seven-million dollar
building. It will house five major
classrooms, a moot court, and a
large library containing three times
as many volumes as the Tucker Hall
library. There will also be space
for 350 carrels, faculty offices, a
faculty library, and student activi-
ties’ rooms. The main level will en-
joy concrete panel ceilings with
much plaster, glass, and brick sub-
stituting for walls. This superstruc-
ture will enclose two courtyards in
which one would expect to find
concrete flowers.

The nine million dollar gift of
Sidney and Frances Lewis of Rich-
mond is more than generous and
is deeply appreciated by the school.
The new facility will allow the law
school to expand to 350 students.
The space Lewis Hail will provide
has been desperately needed since
Tucker Hall outgrew the 76 person
capacily it was built for in 1936,

if this building is to provide the
quantity of space needed perhaps
the education received there will
supply the quality the architects left
out, Let us hope that landscape
architects Griswold, Winter and

Swain of Pittsburgh will add many
trees and schrubs to hide the facade
from view.

The building program also in-
housing for undergraduate

cludes

 

Foreign Study Meeting

There will be a meeting of all
students interested in study abroad
on Thursday, November 9 at 7 p.m.
in University Center Room 114, This
will include those students who
either want to go on WAL’'s own
six-week program or wish to spend
a term of year as a participant in
another institution's program.

The meeting will be sponsored by
the Washington and Lee Foreign
Study Committee. After general in-
formation session, leaders of the
1973 six-week programs in France,
Germany, and Spain will talk with
students specifically interested in
those programs.

students. The project's proposed
budget is one million dollars, At
one point this domicile was to take
the form of modular student apart-
ments, a la Habitat, Concrete cubes
(the rooms) would have been built
in factories, moved to the site and
assembled like a child’s building
blocks, This would be a quick, easy
process, but as bizarre-looking as
it is conceivable. Fortunately, the
“Habitat of Woods Creek Valley”

scheme fell through when the Char-
lottesville company to supply the
modular units declared bankruptcy.

Student Housing Projects

Plans for this project are still
being drawn up. The structures are
planned to provide forty student
apartments, 24 with four bedrooms,
the remainder in three bedroom
units. Each will contain a kitche-
nette and living room for the three
to six occupants of each apartment.
This facility is expected to provide
168 students with living quarters,
designed to meet student needs and
preferences.

While giving undergraduates an
alternative to substandard local liv-

ing conditions the university also
feels compelled to clean up its own
backyard. Apartments are to be
built for married students to replace
the Hillside Terrace ghetto. Thirty
apartments divided among five build-
ings will be erected near the Liberty
Hall ruins. The cost of the under-
taking is estimated at $500,000 with
HUD lending funds on a debt-service
grant,

In contrast to some of the pro-

approximately five million to build
and equip. It will be 130,000 square
feet or four times as large as
McCormick.

A new library is unquestionably
needed but its location, where Wash-
ington Annex I now stands, could
present problems. If the administra-
tion’s taste in architecture is indi-
cated by plans for Lewis Hall a
monstrosity equal to the new law
school will be directly behind the

 

posed new buildings of Washington
and Lee, these should not be too
much of an eyesore. The only un-
fortunate aspect of the project will
be the cost of the rental units. Hill-
side Terrace saves the pockethbaak
of married students by offering
living quarters at $50 a month, but
the new apartments should rent for
at least $110-120 monthly,

Undergraduate Library

McCormick Library is fated for
a change of function and a face-
lift. A new undergraduate library
will be built behind Washington
Hall while McCormick is remodeled
to house the School of Commerce.
The undergraduate library will cost

Perhaps it will not be over ten
stories high and thus not visible
rising above the Colonnade as one
approaches Washington Hall. One
can not be sure until the plans come
off the drawing board. Even if the
architects try to make it comple-
mentary to Washington College
problems will arise as the library's
floor space will be greater than that
of all Colonnade buildings com-
bined,

DISCussions

Santana's Newest

By W. PATRICK HINELY
CARAVANSERAI
Santana
Columbia KC 31610

Every Autumn since I’ve been at
this school I have watched the leaves
turn and fall, enjoying it with a
bit of solicitude about the coming
Winter, which always seems cold
and endless.

Besides knowing for sure that
Spring will be happening, one of the
things that make it all worthwhile
is a new Santana album every Fall.

When I was a freshman, one of
my beer-guzzling frat brothers in-
vited me over one day to party
with him. We downed a few and
he put Santana (Columbia CS 9781)
on the stereo and sat three playing
along with the congas on his Nor-
ton Anthology of English Literature,
That didn’t get me off, but the
album did; I bought one

At the beginning of my Sopho-
more year, | walked into the Band
Box (remember the Band Box?) and
saw Abraxas (Columbia KC 30130)
in the new albums rack. Within 30
seconds, | was running back to
my room to listen to the copy tuck-
ed securely under my arm. This
was followed by a similar occurrence
early in my junior year with San-
tana 3 (Columbia KC 30595). In-
evitable.

So when | walked into the base-
ment of the Co-op on November
1 and saw Caravanserai, it didn’t
take long to decide whether or not
to buy the album. And I’m glad I
did,

After all those rumors: Santana
broke up, he fired his band, they
left the country, they’re all in the
hospital, and all the dejected sour
grapes—‘“gee, that’s too bad, but
they couldn't have gotten much bet-
ter anyway,” and so on, HA!

The first album was a good
rocker; the second album was a
beautiful good rocker. The third
album was an energetic beautiful
good rocker. So now we come to
Caravanserai. The only label | can

yee) i.

put on it is a progressive cnergetic
beautiful good rocker,

That puts it closer to Jazz, But
that’s where Rock music is headed
these days, It’s not a bad place to
be.

There are some new _ influences
present: Pharoah Sanders, Leon
Thomas, Weather Report, the Ma-
havishnu Orchestra, If there is one
element added to this album which
was not in the previous ones, it
is spaciness. Perhaps  sparseness
would be a better term, though it
isn’t anywhere near as sparse as
something like “Dark Star” from
Live Dead.

In the earlier albums, though,
most everyone was cranking away
at a constantly full speed, while in

Booters Meet VPI
After Loss To Navy

CAVALIERE and the Generals needed a win to
make the national tourney. At the
outset, the game seemed to shape
up as an even encounter. The Mid-
shipmen were the first to score, but
WAL stormed right back on a goal
by Brandon Herbert. The 1-1 score
was a close as the Generals were to
get, as the Middies added another
goal before the half to take the lead,
and iced the cake with one more

The Tiger contest was played at

and sandy, It was built on an in-

TAR ty

  

By JIMMY BAIRD
and RICH KOCH

Outstanding performances last
year in basketball, track, and cross-
country resulted in Stu Nibley being
named Freshman Athlete of the
Year. Hopes for a repeat showing
as a sophomore ended, however,
when Stu decided to forego the
glamourous sport of basketball for
relatively obscure cross-country,

Why he did it is difficult to
answer. Stu realized that it would
be impossible to achieve excellence
by dividing his time between two
sports, but which should he enter
fulltime? Stu admits that most of
the pressure on him was directed to
choosing basketball, and even though
the decision was a tough one to
make, he knew that running was
what he wanted to do,

So far Stu has proceeded to
demonstrate that the decision was
the correct one. Second place in the
state cross-country meet, and most
recently, first in the CAC meet,
show that this dedicated runner is
anything but ordinary.

Nibley possesses two keys with
which he has unlocked the door to
his current success: self-discipline
and proper training. He commented,
“Most people do not have the dis-
cipline to work at the solitary sport
of running.” Stu himself runs year-
round, averaging seventeen miles
per day. He abstains from drinking
and smoking, and maintains a special
diet.

In addition, he sets aside almost
nine hours every night as required
sleeping time, claiming that “the
proper amount of rest is the most
important part of running.” Adher-
ing to such rigorous self-imposed
rules would seem to be all work

 

| ‘Stu Nibley: Sees Long
| Road To Success Ahead

 

and no play, but Stu loves to run,
and furthermore, he wants to be
good at it.

Besides running cross-country in
the fall, Nibley plans to participate
in the intercollegiate track program
in the spring. Although he likes the
variation of scenery and course pat-
terns characteristic of cross-country,
Stu. prefers track, because “it is
more psychologically demanding.”

He favors the pressure of close,
visible competition and the atmo-
sphere of excitment generated by
an onlooking crowd in a_ meet.
“However, in just day-to-day prac-
tice, track is boring and tedious,”
he says.

A  cross-counutry runner has
plenty of time to think as he jogs
through the counrtyside every day.
It is not unusual, therefore, when
a runner like Stu Nibley turns his
thoughts to the future, He thinks of
beating the best runners in the
schools Washington and Lee com-
petes against, He thinks of cutting
seconds off his time and going to
the NCAA college meet, and per-
haps to the Penn State Relays.

But ultimately his thoughts go
further. A cross-country runner
normally does not reach his peak
until he is twenty-five years old, It
is not unlikely that the Olympics
looms somewhere in his mind,

Right now Stu’s two-mile time of
9:20.0 is only one minute off
world class, but according to Nib-
ley, he is only a beginner at the
sport, Even so, that minute will only
come down slowly. What is to hap-
pen in the next few years is any-
one’s guess, but if Stu’s enthusiasm
and dedication continue, Washing-
ton and Lee cross-country will never
be the same.

“Most panning don't have the discipline to wah at aii sport of run-

ning.” But Stu Nibley has shown both the self-discipline and the dedica-
tion to earn a very bright future in the field of cross-country.

See-saw Football Fight
Finds Generals Behind

By LEWIS HIXSON

Last Saturday saw the Generals
once again show the kind of see-
saw season they're having as they
dropped a 14 to 0 decision to South-
western, Once again the Generals
found it hard to get up for a game
following a big victory the previous
week. Both teams showed a strong
defense throughout the game as both
scores by Southwestern did not come
from any offensive output,

In the first half the Generals
moved the ball fairly well behind
the balanced running attack of Tom
Van Amburgh and Jim Farrar, This
combination drove the Blue inside
the Lynx 20 yard line twice but
both times they were repulsed as
the Southwestern defense would
stiffen. The only score in the first
half came on a 74 yard punt re-
turn by Jones for the Lynx. The
halftime score showed the Generals
down 7 to 0 in a game that was
truly a defensive struggle.

Early in the second half the
chances of a Blue comeback were
dealt a severe blow. Jim Farrar was
forced to leave the game with a
badly jammed thumb, Not only had
he been running well, but he com-
plimented Van Amburgh greatly
with his excellent blocking. This also
weakened the pass blocking as he
was important to picking up any-
one who got through the line. The
Farrar nullified the Gen
erals’ otherwise strong ground game
forcing Fluharty to put the ball in
ihe air.

However, he only managed to
complete 10 passes in 29 attempts

and two interceptions, both coming
in the second half. One of those
went for a 36 yard touchdown for
the final scoring effort of the game.
The Blue never really made any
kind of a scoring effort during the
entire second half and the game
ended with the score 14 to 0.

If a highlight can be found in a
game such as this, it would have
to be the Generals defense. They
did an excellent job throughout the

game in holding Southwestern to
only 221 yards total offense. The
Blue’s offense must improve this

week for they only totaled 232 yards
for the game.
—_—_—
Next week W&L will meet Deni-
son in a home game and they'd
better be emotionally high, or they
will be blown out of the stadium.
Denison carries a 6-1-1 record and
a good offense into the big Parents’
Weekend contest. They have aver-
aged almost 30 points a game. They
will be bigger than the Blue, and
also very quick on both offense and
defense. Last year the Generals up-
set a strong Coast Guard team with

a superb team effort and they'd need
a similar output if they’re to over-
come Denison.

Win CAC Title

Washington and Lee's — strong
cross-country team, fresh from win-
ning the College Athletic Confer-
ence championship last Saturday,
will close out its season Friday at
home against Madison and Eastern
Mennonite.

The Generals are 7-1 in dual
meets this year and will be favored
to defeat both visiting teams on
W&L’s 5-mile course. The interest-
ing competition is the head-to-head
meeting of W&L’s Stu Nibley and
Madison’s no, 1 runner, Greg
Gerlach.

Gerlach recently broke a course
record in winning the Virginia Col-
lege Athletic Association (VCAA)
meet at Bridgewater, beating Nibley
by 12.5 seconds. But Nibley broke
the W&L course record last Satur-
day to lead W&L to its conference
chamionship,

The W&L sophomore shaved 18
seconds off the old mark, running
the 4.1 miles in 22:07, W&L won
the conference championship with
a team total of 35 points, edging
strong Sewanee which had 41.
Centre College was a close third
with 52 points, while Southwestern
trailed with 106.

The CAC meet was a close one.
After the first four runners for both
W&L and Sewanee had finished,
the two teams were tied with 23
points each. W&L’s fifth man, Bill
Garrison, placed 12th ahead of
Sewanee’s Clark Scott, who was
18th, to win it.

Scoring for W&L were Nibley
first; freshman Jim McMenamin
fourth, Bill Kalal eighth, Mike Burns
10th, and Garrison. Others who
finished high were Jim Ruth 13th
behind Garrison, Tim Washington
14th, and Bob Sherwood 15th.

t be inflicted upon their less than
heroic bunch by the titans of a
finer, now distant era: the Packers,
Giants, Colts.

But no longer, to be a Redskin
fan is to own the University Cen-
ter’s TV set at that blessed time
when Washington’s blessed ones take
to the turf for their weekly lessons
in excellence. Harried Colt patrons
flee, with the embarrassment of a
2-6 season firmly imprinted in their
minds.

Even Dallas’ stubborn  rooters
quiet their crowings in the presence
of their strutting foes. It is indeed
a strange, disquieting year.

At any rate, our capital rumbles
with the noises of rare football
affluence and Indian woes. Sadly, |
find myself believing that George
Allen’s brutes will capture greater
attention in this elequent autumn
than will maligned humanity in its
efforts to secure a bit of justice for
a proud race and | wonder why.

There have not been any Honor
trials since the EC revised the trials
system last year. The revision of
the system was designed, according
to the EC, to rid the trial of a
“circus atmosphere.”

And Groucho’s reply:
“It’s going to complicate things
terribly for us, particularly on
sleeper jumps. In the old days,
we could split up peacefully, two
to a berth. Now, we're three and
there’s bound to be bad feelings.”

Some say that the Three were
better than the Four, Given that, I
doubt if, at that time, Groucho
would have bet his life on it.

A Lively “Troilus And Cressida’

special mention, as does Don Hogle’s
portrayal of Calchus, bearded, bent
as double as his propecies, weasling
his profit out of pain.

The pouting lap dog of lust,
Pandarus, is strikingly rendered by
Dave DeChristopher. The master
mater is suffused with a gay in-
candescence stoked by his hovering
over the sexuality of Troilus and
Cressida. DeCristopher also possess-
es a fine singing voice, for a
pimp. Troilus, played by Brock
Johnson, is appropriately immature
and unregenerate, and Cindy Har-
low's pelvic sauciness evokes the
heat of well-circulated Cressida.
Helen, portrayed by Linda Lawr-
ence, is tacky and tempting. The

compositions such as “Eternal Cara-
van of Reincarnation,” the album’s
opener, the sounds are few and
sometimes far between, but the total
effect is much greater than the sum
of its constituent parts.

Vocals are few and far between;
words are used in only two of the
eleven cuts. They could have done
well, even better, without the vocals
they do have, but I’m not griping
about having to put up with them.
What the music is about needs no
words of explanation. In fact, words
do not exist which can describe the

cast is a strong one, with no damag-
ing weaknesses or shrugging of
roles,

My only quarrel with the pro-
duction is its ending, a forked
anticlimax that duped the audience
into early applause. The battle
scene is terminated, then brought
back for Troilus’ lamentation.
Pandarus’ final address to “Good
traders in the flesh” is omitted, to
a lessening of ultimate impact. This
last speech infects eternity with the
disease of Greece and Troy.

Troilus and Cressida catches man
in the welter of love and war,
spins him dizzy, and challenges him
to right himself to meaning. But
all fall down, and die.

subject of the music. The song
titles are a valiant attempt at the
impossible.

So it can't be verbalized. How-
ever, if you listen to the album
with an open and uncluttered mind
(wipe the dust off of that mirror),
you'll know exactly what it is
Santana are addressing themselves
to. One rumor about Santana which
turned out to be true is that Carlos
is recording an album with John
MeLaughlin. It won't be out until
at least January, so I feel safe in
saying that Caravanserai, to this
point, is 1972's Album of the Year.

A View Of Expansion

conditioning will require a new
maintenance building. The older
buildings of the front campus, e.g.
Washington Hall and the Lee-Jack-
son House, are in great need of
restorative work.

Perhaps the facades of these build-
ings could be changed to match
the newer structures, Sand-blasted
concrete and black-tinted glass might
improve the looks of the Colonnade
buildings but probably not. Some-
one suggested that parking facilities
be built somewhere between campus
and Buena Vista. This plan was re-
jected as parking space is obvi-
ously too extensive at present. If
the campus is doomed to become a
gross mixture of the early nineteenth
century and 2001 let us hope that
prospective applicants and visitors
do not judge books by cover or
schools by appearance.
