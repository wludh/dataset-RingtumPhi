Davis and Sands Contend

For Dance Board Post

T. Barry Davis

For many people here at W&L,
the Dance Board has been just
another body of people that wants
to take money and give nothing in
return. There have been numerous
promises made and every year those
promiss are neatly stashed away
until it becomes necessary to bring
them out again.

This year we were enticed to buy
a dance plan by a notice which
stated that we might be treated to
such acts as America, Paul Mce-
Cartney, or Argent. Have we seen
anything more about there groups?

The fact remains that only public
promoters could possible stage such
acts which up to $20,000 a
night. We don't have the re-
sources here for a weekend concert
of that caliber.

There are possibilities, however,
of having a weeknight concert in the
spring because the musicians charge
less—but this must be approved by
the administration, and so far we've
had very little luck

Averill Harkey

My name is Averill Harkey and
1 am a candidate for the office of
president of your student body, It
is not my intention in this brief
introduction to falsely convey to
you all of those pseudo-political
promises that are so characteristic
of such a campaign. The reason for
this being that the president of the
student body here at Washington
and Lee is not in a position to ful-
fill such promises.

One of the most effective ways to
decide “issues,” such as coeduca-
tion, is to poll the students and
then let me take your opinions be-
fore the Executive Commitee, Uni-
versity Council and the administra-

tion,

Having been on the varsity debate
team here for three years, I feel
that | can take your policy stands
and persuasively convert them to
the appropriate body of our govern-
ment. The important point to re-
member however is that you are
the one that has ask for the changes
to take place,

Only now, with this functional
representative government, as op-
posed to the oligarchial elitist efforts
of the past, will we be able to get

Referenda.

Balloting for these will be on Tuesday, as well.

things done, It is my feeling that
What you, the reader, have experi-
enced, or rather not experienced,
from past and present governments
is communication from these gov-
ernments,

You have elected leaders that
have promised changes, and when
these changes can not be met isn’t
convienient how silent these “lead-
ers” become? It is because once
elected these officers can hide be-
hind their jobs and not reveal to
us, the students, what is going on.

Communication is essential to a
representative student body. But
why is it that the students feel
foggy as to what the Executive Com-
mitee actually does? A convenient
explanation is tacked on to those
in such a fix, It is interesting to
note that those students who pes-
simistically proclaim Washington
and Lee as an apatheitic campus are
indeed themselves the most apathe-
tic. This proposal of apathy just
isn't documented. Why the very fact
that you are reading this letter
circumvents the apathy approach.

A lack of communication from
responsive leaders is why the W&L
student is uninformed. Give me the
chance to let you know what we
can do as students to improve Wash-
ington and Lee and I promise you

that together we will get things
done!

Lewis Powell

To the Student Body:

The President of the Student Body
has major responsibilities relating
to the well being of Washington
and Lee and its students. These
include presiding over the Execu-
tive Committee, serving on the Uni-
versity Council (historically as co-
chairman), and representing the Stu-
dent Body at Trustees’ meetings.
The student holding this office is
also the primary medium through
which students maintain a rapport
with the faculty and administration.

Although all of these duties are
important, that which pertains to
the Executive Committee is the most
consequential. The EC serves a dual
function—it is the students’ principal
legislative body, an dit exercises
exclusive jurisdiction over the Honor
System. This year the EC inaugu-
rated two wide-ranging policies in
these areas, both of which were
long overdue.

The first of these was the active
role assumed by the EC, along with
the Freshman Dormitory Counse-
lors, in Freshman Orientation re-
garding the Honor Sysiem. The
second involved an in-depth analysis
and reallocaiton of the Student Tax.
Both policies reflect the recognition
by the EC of the importance of
continual updating and reevalution
of the needs of the school.

My candidacy for Student Body
President is founded upon two be-
Firsi—that responsive student
represenetation at WA&L depends
upon the continuation of
the policies outlined above, but more
importantly upon the progressive
spirit of student government through
which these policies developed

Harry Smith

I am seeking the office of presi-
dent because | can no longer sit
back and ignore the sad state of
affairs of student government here
at Washington and Lee. Those of
you who have taken the time to
seriously reflect on the present situa-
tion will, | am sure, have reached
the same conclusion: Student gov-
ernment here is no government at
all, but a means of furthering the
narrow career interests of those few
individuals who manage to get them-
selves elected to its offices,

How tragic it is when we con-
sider that it was only a few short
years ago that we were able to
form a government, a government
with the express purpose of repre-
senting our concerns and interests
before the faculty and administra-
tion, a government that many hoped
would speak with a loud and clear
voice. How tragic it is that today
we find this government incapable
of even so much as uttering a
whimper when it come to student
interests, but highly capable and
efficient when it comes time to elect
each other to Who's Who.

It is time to put an end to this
monkey business. Those of you who
know me know that I am not a
political man. Before today I have
never sought a political office,

But let us not fool ourselves;
the other candidates now running
for office, while they have experi-
ence, have quite clearly demonstrat-
ed wha tthe nature of that experi-
ence is: “Rule and change nothing.”
This, however, is precisely what we
do need—change.

I make it the central issue of my
platform. Yes, | am familiar with
all the otf issues—from co-educa-
tion ot the honor code, and even
some the other candidates haven't
thought about—but what good goes
it do to talk about all these things
if we fail to realize that the very
nature of student government as it
exist today will virtually assure that
none of them come to pass?

If | am elected president, 1
promise to devote all my energies
to making the student government
something we can again be proud
of, a government not afraid to speak
up, and a government that is repre-
sentative of all the students—not
just the few.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Five Students Compete for EC Secretary

Paul Cavaliere

Having almost completed my third
year at Washington and Lee I feel
that | have finally reached the point
where | am qualified to run for a
Student Body office. Throughout
these three years I have, at one time
or another, (associated with many
diverse segments of the W&L com-
munity, Both the fraternity and non-
fraternity, the athletic and the non-
athletic, the freshmen and the up-
perclassmen, the studious and the
not so studious, | have made firm
and lasting contacts with members
of each of these segments. Through
these contacts I will be able to re-
late each group's problems or praise
to the Executive Committee as they
are expressed to me. These contacts
take more than two years to de-
velop and that is why I feel | am
qualified for the position of Student
Body Secretary. Please give me your
consideration,

Bob Keatley

The office of Student Body Sec-
retary is one which entails both a
great deal of time and work and
a fairly knowledgeable awareness
of how the Executive Committee is
structured. Having served on the
University Council as a freshman
and currently on the EC as a
sophomore. I feel that I am aware
of the demands of the office of
Secretary makes on an individual
and also the functions that the EC
is responsible for.

One of the primary objectives a
Secretary should have concerns the
freshman orientation during the first
few weeks of the fall term. He
should be aware that the success or
the failure of the EC is acquainting
freshmen with the Honor System is
one of the most important tasks he
will be responsible for as secretary.
A great deal of planning must go
into this orientation, particularly
over the summer, and I am willing
to put Whatever amount of time into
planning that is necessary to insure
its success in September.

in working with the EC, | have
become aware that it is very im-
portant for an EC member to main-
tain a good rapport with the student
body. The Honor System functions
only so long as the student body
feels it is relevant to themselves and
their university. To me it is im-
portant that the student body think
of the officers and the EC mem-
bers as individuals and not as a
select group aloof to student opinion
and sentiment. | do not see how an
Executive Committee could hope to
function effectively if it is not aware
of student opinion through personal
effort and consideration. Knowing
that aloofness can greatly impair
the effectiveness of an EC, I feel
1 would work to avoid anything
of this sort.

Realizing that much time is re-
quired of the Secretary and having
definite opinions about how a Seere-
tary should respond and act in his

Check Committee and three terms

fraternities,

Although the EC will have very
little to say in whether or not W&L
goes co-ed, I suppose I am ex-
pected to give my stand on the
issue. | am against coeducation,
Be sides the obvious dangers of
alumni alienation, cost, and reduced
male enrollment, there are social
dangers. Females doubtlessly have
value, but the proposition that it
is in the classroom is another nvat-
ter altogether. The small advant-
ages we might receive on the hill
would be more than offset by the
holocaust it would bring upon many
of our off-the-hill traditions which
make up a great deal of what W&L
uniquely is. With the exchange pro-
gram and Betty Friedan creeping
feminism has advanced far enough.

Another of this year’s great issues
has been the disbursal of EC funds
to special groups for recruitment.
There is a standing Recruitment
Committee and if recruitment is to
be done, it should be done by this
committee, not by groups. If one
group is granted funds, no group
can justifiably be denied them.
Merit. of course, should remain the
primary criterion in admissions.

Since | am now a Junior, you
can be sure that I won't use this
office to seek a higher one, When
this election is over, never again
will you see my name on a single
campaign poster on this campus.

Everett Martin

David Rigby

The office of Secretary of the

Student Body is not one which
requires “past experience.” What is
needed is a desire to work for

and with students as individuals and
as a group. To this desire I add
my consistent attendance at Execu-
tive Committee meetings which has
left me well acquainted with the
operation of student government.

What Washington and Lee needs
is a sense of community. The first
step in this direction is the ob-
servance of the Honor System. To
complement the effective orienta-
tion of freshmen in this area, there
should also be a re-orientation off-
ered for upperclassmen. For ex-
ample, everyone feels that indepen-
dent exams are helpful and should
remain in practice. This is just not
possible if we have an honor system
that is flagrantly violated. Students
should abide by the System not be-
cause they feel it is their duty, but
because they want to,

What I propose is to have an
EC of action and stimulation, When
that group takes an official stand,
that counts. Such a position should
be taken on any and all issues Which
are of importance to the students,
This includes co-education, the
state-of-the-arts,” the curriculum,
attendance at faculty meetings, re-
cruitmem, and financial matters.
The students have a right to de-
mand all information they desire on
subjects of their immediate concern

What we the students need is not
a return to the WAL Country Club
but student action and involvement
1 ask your help to bring a sense of
community to our campus, Prove
to skeptics that Washington and Lee
students are not apathetic, Instead
of simply students, let's become
friends and bring back the word
trust,

President of the

Ben Sherman

The Executive Committee of the
Student Body is the administrator
of the Honor System, the regulator
of campus activities, and the legisla-
tive arm of the student body. It
is my concern that the EC, in its
legislative capacity, is mot being
active enough in seeing that student
needs and concerms are being heard,
understood, and acted upon.

The office of Student Body Scre-
tary is a position on the EC which
can promote a better understanding
of student needs, That position is
one that involves a good deal of
time and work to see that student
needs are met.

There are many areas on which
student concern should focus.
Among these areas are such diverse
concerns as second hand texts, the
entertainment programs, curriculum
changes, the student tax, Freshman
Orientation and the Honor System.

The Executive Committee, to
function effectively, must be aware
of the opinions of students, faculty
and administrators concerning these
and other problems.

lo fulfill these aims, the EC has
to open channels of communication.
To obtain these channels of com-
munication, the EC must be an
active student government—not a
passive one. To be iactive, its mem-
bers must be willing to devote the
time and energy necessary for it to
become active.

1 would hope that you would
carefully consider what the candi-
dates for Secretary have done to
promote student concerns. | would
further hope that I have proven to
you that I have actively promoted
those concerns in the past.

1 hope you will support me in
promoting your concerns in the
future. Thank you for your support.

Constitutional

Referendum

A proposed constitutional
amendment will be on the bal-
lot. The EC passed the pro-
posal unanimously and encour-
ages the student body to pass it
also. The purpose of the amend-
ment is to alter the Constitution
so as to make it compatible with
the 12-12-6 curriculum. The
Constitution thus amended would
require that student body elec-
tions be held one week earlier
in the Winter Term—thereby
preventing a conflict with Winter
Term exams. The details of the
amendment will be available at
every polling booth.

only after such a notion was de-

For Fancy Dress Post

The duties of the President of
Fancy Dress are probably not what
most students imagine them to be.
Since Fancy Dress is basically just
another university big weekend,
there are only two events during the
weekend which concern the student
body as a whole, a concert and a
university cocktail party. It seems
then that as Fancy Dress Weekend
has declined over the years im signi-
ficance and activity to become just

bilities of the president have like-
wise diminished,

As President of Fancy Dress this
year, | found that my only role in

organizing the concert was that of
just another member of the dance
board

Therefore, the main responsibility
of this office seems to be the organi-
zation of the university cocktail
party. This party is financed by
freshman class dues, and thus a per-
son must be chosen in advance in
to arrange for the collection
of this money during freshman ma
triculation, The party this year
longer usual, was held at the
House instead of a Zoll
man's pavillion, and was generally
considered to have been superior to
ones in the past
