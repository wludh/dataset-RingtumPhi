18 Freshmen
In Monday’s

The first major student elections
will be held next Monday, as fresh-
men will elect representatives for
the Executive Committee, and the
University Council, plus their class
officers.

Candidates filing petitions includ-
ed: for the EC—Jim Davis, Rob
Lindsey, Mike Luttig, Paul Still-
wagon; for President— Ben Barton,
Jay DuRivage, Mark George, Ray

Jones, Leland McCullogh, Robert
Lecky Stone; for Vice-President—
Ronald Harr, Mike Moore, Doug
Muir, Bobby Orkin; for University

Council—Robert Baxley, Alex Bour-
drez, Malcolm Hastings, Bob Kelly.

The election procedure was dis-
cussed in Monday’s regular EC ses-
sion.

Bob Keith, sophomore EC repre-
sentative, moved to raise the ex-
pense ceiling for the freshmen can-
didates from $5 to $7.50; the mo-
tion was carried by the EC and was
further amended to allow an addi-
tional $2.50 in expenditures for any

run-off contests, The $5 limit had
been established by the EC last
week.

Lewis Powell, EC secretary, told

the candidates of the EC’s regula-
tions regarding the elections, Be-

sides the expenditure limit, the EC
has set several other rules for the
election: a candidate may post a
maximum of 25 posters, he may
only post these in the area of the
frshmen dorms, and he must re-
port will campaign expenditures to
the EC by next Sunday night.

The move this year to limit the
number of posters which a candi-
date may distribute came about as
a result of last year’s EC and class
elections, During these spring elec-
tions, as well as in the fall freshmen
elections, candidates were free to

print up and distribute as many pos-
ters as they wished (while not
spending over $20 for the posters),
The result was that campus columns,
walls, and doors were covered with
well over 1000 posters last spring,
a sight against which many students
and faculty protested.

Bob Brennan, EC president, warn-
ed students after the meeting not to
destroy the campaign posters of the
candidates, Brennan stated, “If you
disapprove of a candidate, don’t tear
down his poster; show your prefer-
ence by voting.”

WGL Law News Begins
First Year Of Publication

Operating from a tiny 5 by 15
foot room in the bowels of Tucker

Hall, The W&L Law News has be-
gun its first year as the law school’s
first official newspaper.

Headed by Editor-in-Chief Toby
Harder, the News will be published
twice a month and distributed free
to students and faculty members in
Tucker Hall.

“Most law schools have a news-
paper,” Harder says. “Il was chag-
rined that we had nothing.”

The idea for a law paper first
developed last year among several
students, headed by Harder. The
students procured money from the
law school’s Student Bar Associa-
tion to begin the paper, and now
the News is being operated on a
budget of approximately $1500 per
year,

The goal of the News, according
to Harder, is to “have an indepen-
dent newspaper with an _ indepen-
dent editorial policy.” The editor
says that the paper will serve to
tell the faculty and administration
of the school what the students
think,

Besides Harder, a third-year law
student, three other law students

Film as art demands knowledge
of the technology that is its back-

editor; Ken Wernick, managing edi-
tor; and Dick Mandelson, business

manager. All are third-year stu-
dents.
The paper itself is published in

a tabloid form. According to Har-
der, the staff has designed the News
to differ, physically, as such as pos-
sible from the Ring-tum Phi. Har-
der wants to emphasize the law
paper as being completely indepen-
dent from the Phi. Besides the dif-
ferent size of the paper, a differ-
ent headline schedule and a differ-
ent type of masthead are employed
by the staff,

The editor-in-chief points out that
the News is definitely the first paper
for the law school. He says The
Lawyer, a magazine-type print
which resembles the W&L Alumni
Magazine, is the only precedent to
the paper. Harder states The Law-
yer is more of a public relations
sheet for the law school, which is
“great for the alumni but not for
the students,”

Harder hopes that the News will
attract interest on the part of stu-
dens, faculty, administration, and
alumni alike, but the paper's main
objective is to serve the student
body. “If it (the paper) enhances
alumni support, fine,” Harder com-
ments, “If not, well, too bad.”

October 11, 1972

Clogging Up The Process

It’s been two years now since Congress and the President
rushed through the bill authorizing the 18-year-old to vote in
elections nationwide, After all the rhetoric and all the argu-
ments (“If you’re old enough to fight for your country .. .,”
etc.) the Kids were finally enfranchised, And now, as Novem-
ber approaches and the candidates trade barbs and accusa-
tions, we college students are ready to be handed the ballot
for our first momentous vote. Right?

Well, not exactly—at least, not here in Lexington or many
other college communities throughout Virginia.

You see, when the United States Supreme Court ruled that
the one-year residency requirement held by many states was
unconstitutional, they also said that individual states still re-
tained the right to decide who is and who is not a resident.

And our dear Commonwealth, friends, is using this loop-
hole to the hilt. All over the state, university students are
meeting up with recalcitrant registrars who bombard them
with questions and then tell them to forget it.

Lexington, needless to say, is hardly an enlightened excep-
tion to the rule. The local registrar, who has been available to
prospective voters but once a week, has succeeded in making
it extremely difficult for W&L men to register, law students
included.

The case of undergraduate senior Pete Howe, whose let
ter to us appears elsewhere on this pages seems pretty typical
of Those Who Tried. First, you're asked if you are a student.
Then, if you answer yes, you're asked about your financial re-
lation with your the
months spent in Lexington. Unless you can prove independ

parents, your insurance, number of
ence from your family and meet other specifications, you go
out the door as politically impotent as when you entered,

Now, the local registrar, of course, has every right to ask
these questions. But the ruling of the State Attorney-Gen-
eral, which allows for these queries, doesn’t specify how the
registrar must act upon that information.

We do understand the view that a student should register
in his home town, where his parents pay taxes and where he,
presumably, would be more affected by local issues, But as
Howe points out, W&L men do often pay rent on a local
dwelling year-round, they do pay a local tax on their automo-
biles, not to mention local sales taxes and a brand-new re-
staurant tax (and, by the way, just who is that one aimed at?).
And in terms of sheer voter awareness, does it follow that a
student should be more familiar with the issues and candidates
in Hoboken, where his parents live, or in Lexington, where he
spends nine months of the year?

The most appalling fact has been the treatment of the
married law students. One senior law student, along with his
wife, was told they could not register, evidently because of
student status. Only after persuading the registrar that he had
been independent from his parents for nine years and intended
to stay in Virginia after graduation, were they granted full
registration. “You've got to be extremely persistant,” he said
later. “What they're doing is effectively dissuading people
from voting.”

Much of the fault lies, however, with students themselves.
If W&L men were really determined to register, they could
perhaps have forseen the local difficulties and registered at
home. But, in many states, application for absentee ballots
cannot be arranged through the mail; often, the absentee pro-
cedure is complicated and wrapped up in red tape itsef,

It's too late for this election. But something must be done
before the next to rectify these unfair obstacles. How can
young people be convinced to “work within the system” when
doing just that is made as difficult as possible?

N.E.P.

Alive And Multiplying

We have a little story that should instill some hope back
into the hearts of those despairing friends of the W&L Honor
System. The other day, the manager of the Bookstore decided
to try to attract some of the Commerce School jocks (“We
usually'don't get too many of them in here,” Bettty Munger
confides ).

Well, what better way to attract young businessmen other
than to shower the display table So
copies of The Wall Street Jungle and Up the Organization,
Mrs. Munger arranged a dollar's worth of pennies

with money. amidst

Several days later, just for fun, the coins were counted, It
turned out that the total had become $1.30

So, Watchdogs of the Honor system, take heart; your
baby is not only alive and kicking in the Bookstore, but
it's accruing interest as well

McGovern vs. Nixon: No Alternative

In our continuing series of articles
on the upcoming election, Bill Me-
Ihaney, head of W&L’s John Birch
Society, explains his support for the
American Party ticket. The views
are those of the writer and not of
the Ring-tum Phi. —Kd.

By BILL McILHANEY

After most Americans return
home from the voting booths next
month, filled with the feeling that
they have taken part in the process
by which they help shape their fu-
tures; there appears to be little
prospect of any interruption in the
plans and programs of those elite
personalities who rule us through
the agency of government. The pre-
tense of a national election will no
more change the leadership and
policies of the Establishment than
could a presidential campaign pro-
mote the discussion of real and re-
levant ideological issues at stake
when its two major contenders
dodge such a public discussion by
the distractions of bugged campaign
offices and running mates with re-
grettable medical backgrounds.

The reason why this year’s elec-
tion cannot produce a real change

of leadership or direction of na-
tional policy is the same reason
why those Americans who most
eagerly seck such a change—and

that comprises most all Americans
are not being presented with any

genuine allernative or even al
lowed to know that such an alter
native exists. Tt would be well to

examine the two categories of vie-
tim into which most Americans will
be forced by the performance in
November

First, there is that large mass of
educated” young people, many of
whom voting for the first time this
year, who have an emotional, amor
phous and largely undefined sub
stitute for a reasoned rejection of
the policies of the Nixon Admini
stration—particularly the frighten
ing and increasingly repressive tot
alitarian power which Congress has
allowed the Executive Department
to assume and which has manifested
itself during the past four years in
the forms of massive increases in
spending Q59% of the en
national debt accumulated by
one administration) with the
skyrocketing inflation;
fuscistic wage and price controls al

deficit
tire
just

consequent

legedly to solve a problem caused
by unconstitutional usurpation of
power by the same government; a
seemingly endless but bloody stale
mate in Vietnam which Nixon has
perpetuated in many ways the in
fringement of basic constitutional

rights through the promotion of the
noknock” provisions of the Om
nibus Crime Act, the fed
eral gestapo now being formed un

incipient

der the name of the Law Enforce-
ment Assistance Administration,
and abortion-on-demand in all mili-
tary hospitals.

Phese signposts of growing totali-
tarian fascism in American have
made Richard Nixon justifiably
feared by many young Americans
And to these frustrated young idea-
lists is presented as an alternative
the Democrat candidate, George
McGovern, The mass media has
painted McGovern as an enlighten-
ed and passionate critic of the
Nixon Administration, and yet, all
he has said he would do if elected
is what Nixon is doing—only pro-
mised to do everything that Nixon
has done while Nixon tried to sound
like Wallace (would Nixon carry
out MeGovern’s promises as well?)

Anyone familiar with George
McGovern’s long record of associa-
tion with Communist fronts and
causes, his long record of histori-
cal ignorance inherent and obvious

in his statements about Commun-
ism, and many other items so juicy
that they strongly tempt mention-

ing, could only conclude that if the
Senator from South Dakota is not
actually a member of the Commun-

ist Party, he must have felt he could
be more effective on the outside!
(For the details, see the opening
article by Alan Stang in the Septem-
ber American Opinion.)

George McGovern's promises of
socialism are just as dangerous as
what Mr. Nixon recently threaten-
ed: that his next four years would
rival even the excesses of usurpa-
tion committed during Franklin
Roosevelt's New Steal. McGovern
being presented to the young as an
alternative to Nixon is as cruel a
fraud as would be committed by a
doctor who asks a patient to ac-
cept leukemia in return for relief
from lung cancer,

However, because McGovern and
his supporters, both academic and
troglodyte, sound so threatening (be-
cause they talk about doing what
Nixon doesn't talk about but does),
many average American adults and
both young and old “conservatives”
will vote for Nixon, if not without
regret, believing that any compro-
mise is acceptable to save America
from George McGovern the Ter-
rible and his comypany of creatures

Well, if Nixon is what he
very smart politician), it might be

‘Malo’ Scores Big In

By W. PATRICK HINELY

It seems like a lot of people have
been down on the Dance Board ever
since I’ve been at this school, It’s
just a mater of pleasing everyone,
a near impossible task. Saturday
night, though, I didn’t see anybody
in Doremus who looked unhappy.

Any doubts one might have had
about this year’s Board were cer-
tainly dispelled by Malo, Those are
real live Chicanos from the Frisco
burrio ,and they sound like it, too,
That fire in the blood, as the bass
player from Eggs over Easy put it,
is something they're born with and
other musicians work for years to
get.

Sound system troubles were the
only real problems that interfered
with the show. Eggs over Easy man-
aged to get around them all right,
and their opening sets were smooth.
We're very lucky that the obnoxi-
ous loudmouths didn’t phase the
musicians; I’ve seen groups walk
off stage from much less harass-
ment,

Eggs is a fairly new band, and
they sound like it, too, They do
have an album out, on the A&M
label, called Good and Cheap, in
case you're interested .

They sing real music. “Snakeskin
Boots” and “I'm Funky” came off
quite well; Eggs has found a good
combination of funk, grease, and
just a litthe of that old-time jukin’
that Dan Hicks uses so well. In fact,
that short-haired feller was playin’ a
guitar like Hicks used to use.

The drummer, known as Dewey
deGrease, used to be with a now
defunct Bay area band called Groot-
na, whose album of the same name

(on Columbia, No. C 31033) has a
much better version of “I’m Funky.”

Eggs over Easy was followed by
a 40-minute break to set up for
Malo and to try to repair the sound
system, Once Malo got going, there
was no stopping them. Hadley Cali-
man, the sax player, had a lot of
trouble with his mike, which was

too bad, because he’s really a pretty
good musician.

Without a doubt, though, the per-

his head, by way of his drums, right
into the heads of the audience. The

the regular 9 minutes of that song

Harriers Can’t Lose

By PALMER TRICE

While all three fall teams started
their seasons auspiciously, only
the General Cross-Country team has
managed to stay on the winning
track, The Harriers pushed their
record up to 5-0, with a big triple
triumph on Saturday. Coach Dick
Miller's “high hopes” for this club
are slowly but surely being realized.

The Blue opened their season on
the last day of September at Centre
College. In his first collegiate cross-
country meet, Stu Nibley set a new
course record, and led his team to a
23-37 victory. Centre captured the
second and third places, but the
Blue grabbed the next five, as Bill
Kalal, Mike Burns, Jim McMena-
min, Tem Washington, and Bill
Garrison crossed the line. Bob
Sherwood captured tenth for the
Generals.

In their second meet, Nibley led
the Blue over Lynchburg College by
a score of 27-32. The meet was
much closer than expected, as the
W&L striders might have taken
their opponents a bit too lightly.
General runner Mike Burns was ad-
mittedly surprised at the narrow
margin, The meet was at home, and
the win should have been a more

convincing one.

 

But the Blue made up for the
Lynchburg showing in their next
meet. This past Saturday, the Blue
travelled to Roanoke for a big four
team meet against three of their
tougher opponents, The contest was
held at Roanoke’s home course, one
that measures 5.6 miles, and is one
of the longest on which the Gen-
erals will compete this year, Aside
from Roanoke College, the other
teams competing were Christopher-
Newport and a tough Old Dominion
squad,

Roanoke’s Bill Warner took the
lead early, and opened a good sized
lead over the highly-touted Nibley.
Nibley closed fast as the arce ap-
proached its conclusion, Warner's
lead, however, proved insurmount-
able, and he finished the course in
30:05.7, a littke over 15 seconds be-
fore Stu Nibley.

It would be a more than interest-
ing race if these two could meet
again. One W&L harrier commented
that Nibley was not nearly as tired
as the winner was at the finish of
the meet.

Bill Kalal followed Nibley over
the finish line for third place. After
Kalal came Mike Burns in tenth
place overall, Bill Garrison in four-

Player of the Week

Junior quarterback Lewis Powell has been named Player of the Week
for his outstanding performance in Saturday’s game, He came off the
bench to hit his first five passes of the game, and of the season.
Powell's performance has prompted much talk that he should and
might well be the Generals’ number one quarterback, This week’s
game against Towson should see No. 15 getting much more action,

Generals Fall To Tigers:

Face Towson

By LEWIS HIXSON

The most evident aspect of last
Saturday's loss to Hampden-Sydney
was that the Generals were out-
manned, It was not mistakes that
cost W&L the game, as had been
the case the previous week at Cen-
tre, but purely the fact that the
Generals met a better team. Coach
Leslie felt that his team had been
up for the game, but not even that
could prevent the Generals’ second
loss of the season by a 34 to 6
count.

It was a tough day all around for
the Blue team, as a strong, hard-hit-
ting Hampden-Sydney defense never
allowed them to get untracted on
offense, This meant that the Gen-
erals’ defense was under the guns
most of the day as the Tigers racked
up 437 yards in total offense, com-
pared with the Blue’s 139,

Steve Fluharty had an off day at
quarterback, completing only 2 of
10 passes. The only bright spot of
the day came when Lewis Powell
replaced Fluharty at the helm late
in the third quarter with the ball at
the W&L 19. On the first play from
scrimmage, he hit Bill Baldwin on
a 16 yard pass play for a first down.

This was quite an accomplish-
ment as it was only W&L’s third
first down of the game, and also the
longest gain in the game for the
Generals. Powell went on to com-
plete his first five passes and guide
the Generals to their only score.
The drive covered 81 yards and took
12 plays, with the touchdown com-
ing on a 29 yard pass to Baldwin.
The extra point was blocked and
at this point Hampden-Sydney led by
a 20 to 6 margin.

The Tigers came right back to
put the game out of reach as Nel-
son took them 62 yards in seven

State Next

plays for the score. After the con-
version, the score was 27-6 and
Hampden-Sydney had it all wrap-
ped up. Jack Berry made an ap-
pearance at quarterback after Po-
well was shaken up on an end
sweep. He did a satisfactory job, as
he completed 3 of 6 for 35 yards,
but had one pass intercepted and
was unable to lead the Blue in for
a score.

There weren't many bright spots
for the Generals but a couple of
players deserve mention. Chappy
Conrad continued to remain among
the national leaders in punting, as
he kicked 8 for an average of 42.4
yards. Bill Baldwin caught three
passes for 54 yards, for the Gen-
erals’ only score,

Lewis Powell should certainly be
considered for the starting quarter-
back, as he completed 5 of 7 passes
for 72 yards and a touchdown, The
offense also seems to exhibit con-
fidence in his ability to move them.
Fluharty was rushed very hard as
he was only dropping back about 4
or 5 yards before attempting to pass.

One reason offered by Coach Les-
lie for Powell’s success and for
“Flu’s” dismal showing was_ that
Powell put more pressure on the
Tiger cornerbacks. His roll-outs
forced them to decide quickly
whether it was run or pass,

The General ground attack man-
aged only 26 yards in 35 carries,
which says quite a lot for the Tigers’
defensive line. Overall, it was a
frustrating day for W&L and one
that should be considered as in the
past so as not to affect the rest of
the season,

Coach “Buck” Leslie said that
even though his squad was psycho-
logically prepared for the ballgame,

New Conference Forms:
W&L Is Charter Member

By RICH KOCH AND
JAMES BAIRD

Washington and Lee University is
a charter member of the new Vir-
ginia College Athletic Association,
an organization designed to promote
more in-state competition among
colleges with an undergraduate male
enrollment of 2,000 or less. The
VCAA, formed earlier this year, is
the result of proopsals for such an
organization by William D. Mce-
Henry, Director of Athletics at
Washington and Lee; Bill Shellen-
berger, Athletic Director of Lynch-
burg College; and Thomas Martin,
Director of Athletics at Roanoke
College. These men felt the need
for an association that would, in
the words of Coach McHenry, “give
an identity to the smaller schools
within the state.”

The question arises now: what
about the College Athletic Confer-
ence? Does the VCAA conflict with
the goals and purposes of the CAC?
According to McHenry, president of
the CAC, there is no such problem
whatsoever. Despite the fact that
the decision of Washington Univer-
sity to quit the conference has re-
duced the membership to four
schools, the CAC is by no means
defunct. Washington and Lee will
continue to participate in all the ath-
letic activities of the conference
while in the meantime overtures are
being made to other colleges simi-
lar in standards to W&L to join the
CAC. A formal invitation has al-
ready been extended to Hampden-
Sydney

Coach McHenry took care to
point out that the idea behind the
VCAA was not an athletic confer-
ence per se, but more a confedera-
tion which would allow member-

schools the chance to participate if
they choose to. The rules state that
each school has the option to se-
lect which sports it wants to com-
pete in so long as it is decided be-
fore September | of that academic
year. Therefore, the VCAA actu-
ally serves as a forum for the
schools, making scheduling of inter-
member contests convenient and or-
ganizing championship events in
each sport. The membership of the
VCAA includes Washington and
Lee, Bridgewater, Clinch Valley,
Christopher Newport, Emory and
Henry, George Mason, Hampton In-
stitute, Hampden-Sydney, Lynch-
burg, Madison, Randolph-Macon,
Roanoke, St. Paul, Virginia State,
and Virginia Wesleyan.

rhe association provides for com-
petition in eleven sports: football,
cross-country, soccer, basketball,
wrestling, swimming, indoor and
outdoor track, baseball, golf, and
tennis. Washington and Lee plans
to participate in all eleven—the
number being left up to the discre-
tion of the individual schools,
Championships will be decided in
each sport by way of a one or two-
day tournament. A unique excep-
tion to this procedure is football, for
which a tournament is impractical.
lo compensate for this the associa-
tion coaches decided to meet at the
each season and on the

schedules and records
choose the outstanding team for the
year, an all-association squad, and
a coach of the year.

The VCAA offers many advan-
tages to its member colleges. Be
sides the convenience in scheduling
athletic events and sponsoring tour
naments, there is the additional ad
vantage of extended publicity in the

close of
basis of

media the organization can
hat the individual schools cannot

vain on their own. The cost of these

benefits is perhaps the greatest plus
for the new association. The basic
membership price is $100 but a
small participation fee is charged
for each sport with the total yearly
cost not to exceed $175, Team tra-
vel expenses are minimal since the
schools are all located in the Domi-
nion. This last asset is particularly
attractive to the small colleges with
a limited athletic budget, such as
WAL,

Despite the numerous advantages,
the VCAA does not have all open
field ahead of it. In fact, one of its
major strongpoints could become a
fatal weakness. The emphasis on
voluntary participation by the mem-
bers in time could result in disin-
terest and withdrawal from the as-
sociation. But as it stands now, con-
siderable enthusiasm is being shown
throughout the VCAA. If this feel-
ing is continued and transmitted to
the general public, the Virginia Col-
lege Athletic Association will grow
into an impressively competitive or-

ganization.

OAS Plans Sta ged Crisis

Preparations for the W&L Model
Organization of American States
have moved into high gear as “OAS
Weekend”, November 17, 18, draws
near. Held annually since 1968,
Secretary-General Nick Grant ex-
pects the best model simulation in
recent years. He cites high interest
among freshmen and the return of
experienced upperclassmen as_ the
reason for his optimism.

Grant and five committee chair-
men have met each week to lay
plans for the event which expects to
draw participants from such schools
as Georgetown University and the
University of Pennsylvania as well
as Virginia area colleges. A total of
125 people will take part.

During OAS Weekend
send delegations of

schools
two to four

people to represent one of the

twenty-three member nations. Un-
der direction of the Secretary-Gen-
eral, the simulation proceeds, Agen-
das are set, resolutions are proposed
and debate follows. Careful prepara-
tion by each delegation and their
research advisor ensures accuracy,
To test the knowledge of all and to
add excitment, an international
crisis is manufactured while the
OAS is in session.

Delegates, advisors and research-
ers are still needed, Anyone inter-
ested should contact Nick Grant at
463-2773 or attend the next dele-
gates meeting on October 19 in the
WA&L Student Center, room 114.

For those interested in observing
the proceedings, the floor will be
open during the entire simulation.

tion’s continuing aid and trade poli-
cies with the Soviet arsenal of the
Viet Cong; the betrayal of Ameri-
ca’s staunchest friend, the Republic
of China, for the purpose of bow-
ing down in utter disgrace to a re-
gime of criminals now controlling
Mainland China, who boast of the
tens of millions of Chinese they
have murdered to hold their power
and who officially harvest and ex-
port most of the heroin now de-
stroying American youth within our
borders; the reduction of our mili-
tary posture to a position finally in-
ferior to the Soviet empire which
our exported western technology so
graciously built over the years; and
on and on,

I do not think I need to add it,
but, for any late arrivals who doubt
my statements—just give me a
chance to show you the evidence!
Those middle Americans and “con-
servatives” who vote for Nixon,
with the best of intentions for elect-
ing the lesser of two evils, will still
be voting for the same evil and
they constitute the second class of
the potential victims of that evil. It
all sounds like what Ayn Rand call-
ed “the sanction of the victim”,
which that he is a victim and the
means by which he could save him-
self,

There is nevertheless a real alter-
native being offered Americans next
month: the candidacy of Congress-
man John G. Schmitz and Thomas
J. Anderson on the American Party
ticket—a_ genuine alternative for
all potential American victims to
the disaster represented by King
Richard and his partner with the
Phd., the nature of which alterna-
tive will be discussed in the second
part of this article.

Tigers Maul Generals

(Continued from page 4)
that preparation went down the
drain when the Tigers’ strength and
quickness enabled them to. score
their first two possessions. Four-
teen points is a lot to catch up afiter
less than a quarter of football.
Next week the Generals play a
home game against Towson State, in
what should prove to be a very
even match-up. Randolph-Macon
routed Towson by a 34 to 0 count,
and the Yellow Jackets are reputed
to be on an even keel with Hamp-
den-Sydney. Towson State has yet
to win one this season, and the Gen-
erals would like to keep it that way
this Saturday,

Soccer Team Loses First Match

(Continued from page 5)
the shots were successful, due to the
outstanding goal-kKeeping of Paul
Devine,

The Blue looked relatively better
in the second half. Their traps and
passes improved, and they seemed
to put the Madison squad on the de-
fensive. Twice the Madison goalie
was beaten, only to have one of
their fullbacks step in to block the
attempted goal. This fine defensive
work seemed to inspire the Dukes,
and with six minutes remaining in
the game Madison penetrated the
tough General defense with a beau-
tifully executed scoring play, W&L
started to lose the initiative when
Rolf Piranian was ejected from the
game for losing his temper when
fouled by an opponent, A series of
unsuccessful goal attempts also frus-
trated the Blue. Time ran out be-
fore the team could piece together a
scoring drive,

After each game Coach Lyles
presents an award to the most valu-
able player in the game. This award,
culled the 110% Award, went to
Barclay Armstrong for his hustle at
the center fullback position in the
Mennonite game. The recipient of
the award for the Madison game was
goalie Paul Devine, who displayed
leadership and finesse at his posi-
tion,

Coach Lyles said of the game,
“Madison has not proven to me to
be the best team in our division,
They should not have won the
game. WAL still has a shot at the
division championship, so we're go-

ing oul to get it.”

Washington and Lee’s next home
soccer match is against Indiana Uni-
versity on Saturday, October 14th,
at ten o’clock a.m, A junior varsity |
game against the VMI rats has been’ 7)
scheduled for October 12th at 4:30 {
p.m. on the W&L field. Admission
to the games is free. If you are in-
terested in viewing some exciting
soccer games, come out and watch
the Generals in action.
