LEXINGTON,

Lewis Hall Ceremony
Planned For Saturday

Ground will be officially broken
Saturday, May 26, for Lewis Hall,
W&L’s $7-million law building.

The groundbreaking will take
place at 1 p.m., following the
close of the spring meeting of
Washington and Lee’s board of
trustees,

Frances and Sydney Lewis of
Richmond—whose gift of $9 mil-
lion last year assured construc-
tion of the new facility, named
for them—will attend the ground-
breaking. Mr. Lewis is a member
of the W&L board.

George W. Kane

Inc., general

firm based in Dur-
ham, N.C., has been awarded the
$5.7-million construction contract
for Lewis Hall. Costs of designing
and furnishing the building are
expected to bring the total cost
above the $7-million mark, ac-
cording to university estimates.

The building—which will per-
mit an expansion of W&L’s law
student population from 250 to
350—will be completed in 1975.
Its location is on previously un-
developed land owned by W&L to
the west of the Front Campus

Iialian Sojourn Scheduled
In W&L Foreign Studies

A new program of study abroad
for Washington and Lee has been
approved by the Foreign Study
Committee and the Committee on
Courses and Degrees and is to be
forwarded to the Faculty for gen-
approval, to go into effect
with the Spring Term next year.

eral

The course, to be known as
Italian 202 involves six weeks’
study in Siena, Italy and is in

most respects comparable to the
programs in operation for the last
years in Paris and Madrid.
However, this course will not be
strictly a language course and will
involve studying in Italy during
the Spring Term in a field of the
studeint’s choice. Also, no pre-
vious knowledge of Italian will
be required.

The basic core of this program
will be a project in the field cho-
sen by the student and approved
in advance by the proper depart-

three

ment at Washington and Lee. An
English-speaking tutor chosen
rom the student body at the

University of Siena will be assign-
ed to each participant to aid him
in finding materials related to his
project and to the report he is to
on it. reports will be
graded for credit by the appropri-
ate department at Washington
and Lee, Credit ean be divided be-
tween the department of the pro-
ject and the Italian department,

write These

for a total of six credits.

A student may choose to take
more courses in Italian and work
in a field related to the Italian
language and culture and receive
all six credits in Italian. An addi-
tional advantage to this option is
that a student can complete his
entire Division I requirement in
one Spring Term.

Residence will be with Italian
families, as in the French and
Spanish programs. Additional lee-
tures and trips covering cultural,
political and economic aspects of
Italy will be included. It is likely

that some of the study will be
done in nearby Florence.
Travel to Italy will be by air.

The cost of the program will be
the same as the French and Span-
ish programs. Operation of the
proposed program is subject to
sufficient registration by students
in advance, Declaration of intent
must be made by Thanksgiving
and payment of the initial deposit
by the first of next year, Full pay-
ment will due by March 15,
1974. More specific information is
available from the Romance lan-
guage Department as well as sev-
eral other departments at Wash-
ington and Lee. Dr. Scharff of the
Romance Language Department
expects to travel to Siena this
summer to set up final arrange-
for the program.

OUTLOOK and REVIEW

Increasing the Student Tax

This week, Washington and Lee will probably see one of
the more important battles of recent times waged by W&L
students. No, we are not speaking of the lacrosse game Sat-
urday against Maryland, although that is certainly important
in its own right. Rather, we are talking about a battle by the
1973-74 Executive Committee to increase the student tax for
next year.

The present student tax is $17, and it is taken from the
comprehensive tuition fee of the university. It is interesting to
note that, for next year, the comprehensive tuition fee will
rise $300, while there has been no increase in the university's
allotment to the student tax.

So what's so important about the student tax? Money from
the tax goes toward funding a host of student activities—the
IC itself, all its subcommittees, the Publications Board, Ariel,
the Ring-tum Phi, Calyx, part of Contact’s expenses, the Stu-
dent Bar Association, and the Student Body Reserve Fund.

But the list of activities is constantly growing. This year,
the EC revamped and expanded its University Center Commit-
tee into an all-encompassing Student Affairs Board, and the
W&L Law News was initiated. The funds for both of these
have to come from somewhere, and under present financial
structure within the W&L community, the funds must come
from the student tax.

Not only are new student activities adding to the expenses
to be met by the student tax, but inflation is also leaving its
mark. Various publications take up a major share of the stu-
dent tax, and printing costs have been on a sharp upswing in
recent times. But it costs more to do anything nowadays, and
the EC must meet rising expenditures with fixed revenues,

There are two points to be made here: the comprehensive
tuition fee is consistently being raised with no subsequent
raise in the appropriations for the student body ; and there are
each year more and more expenses which must be met by the
IC on behalf of the student body with a fixed income.

It is difficult to believe that every penny of next year’s $300
increase in tuition is needed desperately by the university.
Many students have been left incredulous by the increase, and
this incredulousness will remain unless these students can see
a viable application of the added revenue, Such an application
could come in the form of an increase in the student tax.

estimating that about 1650 students will attend the univer-
sity next year, we can see that about half a million dollars will
be added to the school's coffers on the basis of the increase
alone. This does not account for any increase coming from,
say, a larger enrollment.

Half a million for the university, and not one penny for
direct student use. The situation is not all that dire, as cer-
tainly the increase will go toward university expenses either
directly or indirectly affecting the students, But it certainly is
a bit strange when out of all that money, not one penny is
viven to the students for their direct use, particularly when
the students are the ones who are paying the half million.

\ny increase in the tax certainly would not take a large
chunk out of the university's operating budget, but it would
benefit the students directly, The EC would have more money
with which to operate student activities. Why not increase
the student tax proportionately with the increased tuition?
The tuition has increased by one-fourth in the past three
years. Why not raise the student tax by one-fourth to just over
$21 per student? The increase would add over $6500 to the
student body's funds, without taking a really substantial cut
out of the university's revenues as a whole.

We hope the EC manages to win the battle with the ad-
ministration over the question of the student tax. Without an
increase in revenues, next year’s EC will have to mediate
among the various student activities all asking for more
money, and the results could be even less money and possibly
even the curtailment of some of these activities.

Frustrations Of A Pizza Lover

By SKIP PAUKERT

Like any self-respecting college
kid, I love Pizza. In fact, my
weekly pie is one of those few
things which I simply couldn’t
live without; if ever I could mus-
ter the courage to swear off that
Italian ambrosia for Lent, I
wouldn't make it alive to Easter,

Ah, there is nothing to approach
it! A piping hot pie, right from
the oven, is placed down on the
table in front of you. The steam
rises from that amazing concoc-
tion of meat, tomato sauce, and
still-bubbling cheese. And _ then,
you take that first bite—and reach
a gastronomic orgasm as the moz-
zarella clings to the slice des-
parately, long and stringy. .. .

As with any great food, the
quality of pizza varies greatly.
When I was very young I swore
off Chef-Boy-Ar-Dee Frozen piz-
zas: a sure let-down every time.
But then, there are a few accept-
able frozen versions (if you look
hard enough) and box mixes (Ap-
pian Way, for instance) can be
alright in a pinch.

Nevertheless, to get a_ really
fine pie, one almost always has
to go to a restaurant, preferably
one which specializes in this Ital-
ian delight. And likewise, the
quality of the pies varies in such
establishments from the very best
to the very worst.

If vou start with a half-decent
base (light crust, spicy tomato
sauce, good mozzarella) you can
build a truly great pie. Person-

Letters To T

Busted Students Backed
To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi

As the sentencing date for three
Washington and Lee students in-
volved in the drug cases draws
near, we feel that it is necessary
that a few widespread sentiments
among students be expressed,

Since the November drug bust,
many of us have become aware
for the first time of the serious-
ness of distributing drugs—in-
cluding marijuana. Although we
do not agree with the severity of
the possible punishments, we
have, by mere exposure to the
cases, been made fully aware of
the fact that lengthy prison terms
and heavy fines are very real al-
ternatives for the state to impose.

It is our sincere hope that the
Lexington community feels no
need for a precedent to be set, in
the sense of desiring that one or
more students be sent to prison.
The shock of finding our friends
and fellow students suddenly con-
vieted felons has, by itself, had a
most sobering effect on the stu-
dent body, as well as these in-
dividuals themselves. Surely this
community can accept less than
the penitentiary for a smal! group
of unaware students who accom-
modated two ostensible friends
(narcotics agents) in their re-
quest for drugs.

We, the undersigned, do not
condone the activities of the stu.
dents involved. But, as they were
unconscious of the legal serious-
ness of their crimes, we do sup-
port their right to remain among

the normal members of society.
We hope and pray that these
voung men will not have to be-

come warped in a prison cell for
deeds that they only now under-
stand to be so wrong by law.

SCC Ruling Attacked

To the editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

Two weeks ago you allowed
space for the Student Control
Committee's explanation of ite
position on the illegal drug distri
bution, In that space five points
were given to try to show that in
this drug there were “ex
tenuating” circumstances, | firmly
that nene of the points
offers substantial reason why this
University should not withhold
degrees to all students concerned

In consideration of the first

point, | agree that there is a close
relationship with all of the cases
in question and = that aetion

mainet only

ally, 'm a food pizza man myself
—the more extra goodies that
can be piled on top, the better.
Why someone would eat a “plain”
cheese pizza has always been in-
scrutable to me—I can feel only
remorse and pity for the poor
fellow, however well-meaning he
may be, who eats a pizza without
imagination or a sense of adven-
ture. To my palate, pepperoni and
mushrooms are a must, with
green pepper, onion, hamburger,
olives, etc. rendering it all the
better.

A Dismal Scene

All of which brings us to the
Pizza scene in Lexington, which,
sorry to say, is dismal at best.
Here we have two great institu-
tions of higher learning with a
combined population of thousands
of hungry boys—and not a single
outstanding pizza parlor in town.

It really is a sad state of affairs,
because what we're missing is
more than just good food. In most
college towns, the pizza parlor is
a center for the community, a
place of fraternity, good times,
good beer, and good grub, The
local pizza parlor is usually the
most aromatic and comfortable
environment on campus. But
here. ...

The College Inn comes Closest
to filling this bill, and pizza is
the most popular item on the
menu. Evidently at one time, Jong
ago, the “CI” was the hangout;

students would be “grossly un-
justified.” Yet there is no reason
on this good earth why their de-
grees cannot be withheld pend-
ing a decision in all cases by the
court. The logie of the SCC on
this point escapes me entirely.
Obviously after all the students
have been convieted, further ac-
tion by the University could be
taken according to the court's de-
cision. As it stands now, however,
the University will have conferr-
ed degrees and recognition § to
three convicted felons without so
much as a word of disapproval.

On the second point, | concur
that there are “degrees of crimi-
nalitv.” But under no. cireum-
stances can | consider the sale of
illegal drugs, whether it be to
little ladies or infants, as “accom-
modating.” The SCC would have
us believe that there are felons
and there are felons and that
there is a_ difference between
them. But | say there is no differ-
ence when the reputation and
honor (as corny as it may sound
to some) of the University is at
stake.

On the third point, it cannot be
denied that the hardships of con-
vieted criminals are great, but |
believed they should have con-
sidered this before breaking the
law and dishonoring the Univer-
sity. Action by the University
should not necessarily be motivat-
ed by a desire to make things
hard for these students, but rath-
er by sincere concern for the
University and its role as an hon-
orable institution of learning.

The SCC also maintains that its
inaction on this matter was jus-
tified since a “severe penaity ap-
pearing in their pre-sentence re-
ports might have an adverse ef-
fect” on the sentencing of the stu-
dents by the court, Withholding
their degrees until all sentences
are handed down could hardly be
considered anything but under-
standable caution on the part of
the University.

The final point is one which
we are expected to take at face
value—that the student body
never Intended for the University
to “feel the need to take action”
if such were brought up
The text of this point is so loosely
worded that | wonder what the
SCC reallyy meant by it, but if it
is saving that the students believe
drug pushing doesn't effect one's
at W&L then I shall be so
bold as to doubt the word of the
committee unless evidence is pro
duced

All of “extenuating” elt
cumstances are no more than ex

those faded dusty glossies of for-
mer teams and old Big Band
leaders in the window attest to
former glory for this restaurant.
But now it lacks a certain some-
thing and the pizza itself,
though maybe the best in town,
is still far from a “very good” rat-
ing.

The biggest problem is the
crust, where all good pizzas be-
gin. In Lexington, frozen crusts
are imported by truck—they are
too thick and taste like card-
board. Secondly, the Cl relies on
its staple tomato sauce, which is
a little greasy and not spicy
enough,

The cheese is generally okay
and generously applied, but after
these humble origins, the pizza
really has nowhere to go, The Cl
also lacks a variety of toppings
and combinations; there is no
special “deluxe” pizza on the
menu, and with each added item
costing 35-45 cents, making one
up vourself can be really expen-
sive.

The other place where pizza is
featured prominently on the bill
of fare is Mother's, They do have
a “deluxe” pizza, with an abund-
ance of items, but at $5.00 for a
large (12") pizza, it is way over-
priced, Mother's boasts the same
basic crust and sauce as the Cl,
and slightly higher prices to
boot.

A similar, rather rubbery ver-
sion can be found at the Southern

Inn, but since they are busy mak-
ing Mousaka and other dishes,
you can’t expect a really stellar
pie. The surroundings here, of
course, are nicer, service quite
good... but the pizza just accept-
able.

Lexington is a frustrating place
for those of us who like food on
our pizzas. When you pay an ex-
tra 45 cents for mushrooms, you
don’t want to have them = cut
down the the pepperoni to make
room. Mother's is particularly
guilty of this stinginess with ex-
tra items.

Need For Pride

One can probably sum up the
whole problem in one word:
pride. None of the local restaur-
ants seems to take pride in their
pies, and, as everyone in the piz-
za world knows, care is the most
important ingredient. With care,
a pizza can be a memorable ex-
perience; without it, its simply
another sad _ pie.

Perhaps someday | will return,
an old alumnus, and will find to
my delight that things have really
changed—that a great pizza has
finally arrived in Lexington. But
the present state is too cruel for
any pizza fan to be forced to en-
dure. | would not send my son (or
daughter) to college here until |

Honor System Supported

To the editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

Mr. Kearney'’s article in’ the
May 9, 1973, Ring-tum Phi raises
two important questions about
the Honor System. First, what is

Middies roared back, with the
tying goal coming on a shot by
Marty Mason with only two ticks
on the clock remaining.

The game started off just as the
Virginia game had the week be-
fore. Navy jumped out to a 2-0
lead, putting together a pair of
well executed fast breaks with
Dave Bayly and Tom Venier on
the scoring end of the plays.

But the Generals got back in,
mainly through the efforts of
Skip Lichtfuss. At the midway
mark of the opening period, the
Stick avoided several attempted
checks and muscled his way past
three Navy defensemen to score
the Generals opening goal.

After Bill Kordis scored the
first of his four goals to give the
Middies a 3-1 lead, Lichtfuss

struck again, working in almost
the same manner that enabled

him to score his finest goal. When
this one hit the back of the net,
it made the score Navy 3, W&L 2.

Problem for Finnegan was that
the ball bounced off his stick and

Rand’s ‘Fountainhead’

Ends Film Season
(Continued from Page 2)

ight for his values and his work,
without ever compromising,
against the elite parasites and se-
cond-handers of his world who
fear his ability and integrity, and
try to destroy him, Unlike most
contemporary dramas of indivi-
dual struggle, in The Fountain-
head there is the example of a
realistic hero who challenges the
world by fighting to live his life
for his own sake, for his own
values ,never to be the object of
sacrifice by others—and he wins.
The example is given also of those
who would dstroy him, those who
would use him to compensate for
their own worthlessness, and the
woman who worshipped him, but
almost lost him willingly because
she was convinced that no one as
good as he could survive on this
earth.

When you see The Fountain-
head on May 29, the image of
Howard Roark may be a strange
and unfamiliar one in your life.
There are few men like him.
Those few move the world and
give it force. You will recognize
many Ellsworth Toohey’s and
Peter Keating's, particularly with-
in this academic jungle from
which some of us are soon fortun-
enough to escape. What is
crucially important for you is;
Will you see your soul in Roark
or in those who went down try-
ing to destroy him? This film de-
monstrates the alternatives from
which you must select and their
consequences for your life.
