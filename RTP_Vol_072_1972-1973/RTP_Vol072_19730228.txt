New Coed Poll
Expected Close

Big five elections are this coming
Monday, but there’s not much su-
spense involved in three of the five
offices. There is only one candidate
running for each of the offices of
student body president, Fancy Dress

president, and Dance Board vice-
president,
Junior Lewis Powell is running

unopposed for the office of student
body president. Freshman Darryl
Carlton withdrew from the campaign

earlier this week, leaving only
Powell in the race.
Richard Jones is running unop-

posed for Fancy Dress president,
and Barry Davis is the only candi-
date for vice-president of the Dance
Board,

The battle for vice-president of
the student body lists three contest-
ants: Mike Brittin, Steve Greene,
and Bill Warburton. Four candidates
are running for student body sec-
retary: Bob Keatley, Paul Cavaliere,
Dave Rigby, and Ben Sherman.

Although there is no contest in
the Presidential race, there will be

Trustees Meet In Atlanta,
Review University Affairs

Last weekend the Board of Trus-
tees held their winter meeting in At-
lanta and reviewed the affairs of the
school, Most of the business brought
before the board was fairly routine,
such as budgetary planning and re
view of the various aspects in the
life of the school.

One of the highlights of the week-
end was the showing of the Reeves
Colection of Chinese export porce-
lain in the High Museum, Atlanta
On the night of Friday, February
23, a reception was held in the High
Museum for the Trustees and inter-
ested alumni in the Atlanta area,
The collection will be exhibited in
Atlanta through April 8

The reception broke up two long
days of meetings and hard work for
the trustees, On Thursday at 8:00

OUTLOOK and REVIEW

The Arts Saga (Cont. )

Realizing the risk of boring everybody to death with old
business, we nevertheless want to take note of a significant
development in the continuing saga of the Fine Arts at W&L.

As you recall, the whole issue saw first daylight in these
pages in the form of a letter by Mr. Greg Buch way back in
September. Since then, after discussion and more discussion,
an ad hoc committee formed by the University Council has
been working on a report on the situation. Their purpose was
to explore the current condition o fthe Art, Drama, and Music
resources and to make recommendations for improvements in
these areas.

The report has been completed—chock-full of all kinds of
interesting recommendations—and was carried by Student
Body President Bob Brennan to the Board of Trustees’ meet-
ing at the Regency Hyatt House in Atlanta this past week-
end,

The report notes that the basic recommendations made by
the Self-Study of 1964-1966 “appear to have been forgotten,”
and it restates and adds to many of those original suggestions.
Among the short-range recomemndations were: increased staff
for all three departments to absorb sharp enrollment boosts,
more studio space for Art and Drama, and better listening
facilities and instruments for the Music department.

Among the long-range recommendations were: a larger
and safer gallery for display of the university's art collection
and, above all, some kind of theatre-music complex to improve
facilities in those areas.

The Board's response to this report was encouraging.
\fter careful consideration, the gentlemen passed a resolution
which (a) recognizes the importance of the Fine Arts in the
W&L curriculum, (b) thanks the committee for their assidu-
ous efforts and for the report and (c) directs the administra-
tion to study the issue and to report to the Board at its May
necting.

Much labor and concern has been expended to articulate
the very critical needs of the Arts at Washington and Lee.
The issue must not be allowed to get lost in bureaucratic
shufflings, however, and we shall be looking for the all-impor-
tant follow-up which this initial effort deserves.

N.E.P.

To the Athletes Dying Unknown

With the basketball team having an off year, posting a
final 13-12 seasonal mark, interest in Washington and Lee
sports seemed to slack off this winter. The problem was that
fans didn't drop off from watching basketball and switch to
watching swimming or wrestling; they just dropped off from
watching basketball . . . period.

Meanwhile, before crowds which sometimes did manage
to reach fairly respectable (i.e. about 200 persons) size, the
swimmers and wrestlers pulled off some pretty stellar perfor-
mances this year, racking up two of the best regular season
records (10-2 in swimming: 13-5 in wrestling) this school has
seen in any sport in a long time,

Furthermore, the swimmers won the VCAA meet, took

third place in the state, qualified several swimmers for the
nationals, and, just this past weekend, won the CAC meet in
Sewanee. And a host of records were broken or tied by the
W&L swimmers along the way to a spectacular season under
Coach Bill Stearns.

And the wrestlers didn't exactly do badly in tournament
competition either. They also won the VCAA, and they cap-
tured the CAC bell this past weekend too. Under Coach John
Piper, the grapplers came a long way from last year’s .500
record,

Now as lacrosse fever begins to invade the campus, most
students will be thankful to God and/or R. I. Lee that this
dull winter sports session is nearing an end. And just because
they never made it to a swim meet or a wrestling match this
year, and just because the basketballers had a bad season.

Fortunately, with only a handful of athletes graduating
from the swimming and wrestling teams this year, a repeat
performance in following seasons is more than just a possibil-
ity.

But nonetheless, some great performances were missed this
year by the vast multitude of the W&L sportswatchers who
couldn't take time out to watch the swimmers and wrestlers
do some swimming this year. We congratulate these two teams
on their performances this year, and we hope that their accom-
plishments do not go unrecognized by the student body,

P.J.L.

‘Big Five’ And The Coed Vote

Just how the annual ritual which will be decided this
Monday came to be known as the “Big Five” elections, we're
not sure. It does seem delightfully anachronistic—a vestige of
the hard-loving, hard-drinking W&L of old—to be voting for
Dance Board and Faney Dress offices on the same ballot with
Student Body President, Vice-President, and Secretary.

Well, times do change. What was once a furious contest
for Dance Board and Fancy Dress leadership has been reduced
to a pair of unopposed contests.

In the race for Student Body President we are going to
go out on a limb and predict that Mr. Lewis Powell (running
unopposed) will win.

In the race for Vice-President of the Student Body (be-
tween Messrs. Brittin, Greene and Warburton) as well as the
contest for Secretary (between Cavaliere, Keatly, Rigby, and
Sherman), the voting should be much closer,

Not to mention the interesting repeat of the referendum
in which every student's vote will be crucial. While a “yes”
vote on coeducation may not mean an instant turn around of
faculty and administration sentiment, it would most definitely
turn a few heads. If W&L is to seriously consider once again
the coeducation alternative (and we believe it should), a
strong endorsement of the idea on the part of the students will
be absolutely essential.

So with two very competitive and important races, plus
a referendum which may influence the future direction of
Washington and Lee, none of us can afford to “stay home” on
Monday.

Letters To The Editor...

‘Bigotry’ vs. Women

fo the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi.

There has been an apalling silence
on our campus concerning the ques-
tion of coeducation, Silence, how-
ever, and living death (1 do not
consider this an overdramatization)
are what most characterize this cam-
pus. WAL exists as an anomoly, an
archaic outpost of monasticism. I
think the “death” on this campus is
an inevitable result of the nature of
our group situation, Each person is
very much alone here—part of no
community because WAL lacks the
basic elements which combine to
make any real community.

There can be no way for a man
to understand himself outside of a
human context, As long as W&L
lacks women, we have no true
human context in which to live. The
incredible fact that men on our
campus do not miss women on a
day-to-day basis (as evidenced by
the defeat of last year's referendum)
shows just how far many have fal-
len from any sense of their own
humanity. Hew can we expand be-
yond our own personal choking
worlds to act communally, when no
real community exists?

The homogeneity of our group on
campus causes this suffocation. We
have but three women professors,
and almost no racial minorities are
represented either in the student
body or on the faculty, We are thus
denied the richness of possibility
that people from diverse back-
ewrounds can contribute by their uni-
queness alone. Our president, our
trustees, and most importantly the
students must believe that there is
nothing to be shared with women or
non-white men, The position is not
simply outdated; it is hatefully
wrong. It's bigotry in the most evil

ofrse, lof m oie

ho one academic

community can claim ignorance of
the progress in human relations the
rest of the world has made over the
past hundred years.

Only on our campus does the term
“date” persist, evidence of the hide-
ous custom of arranging an appoint-
ment for contact with a woman.
Only in this sexual role do women
appear on this campus (excepting
our few token co-eds), and they are
apparently considered in no other
sense. If we limit the extent of a
woman's humanity, we limit the ex-
tent of our own,

Russ Powell ‘73

W&L, VMI, FCC, ’LUR

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

I write in regard to Mr, White's
letter last week concerning WLUR,
I am sorry that he feels this way
about the station and what it is try-
ing to do. Some of his disagree-
ments, | think, stem from misunder-
standing.

tl is true that we call ourselves
the “Radio Voice of Washington
and Lee.” First, let me say that this
slogan is primarily used for pro-
motional purposes, Perhaps it is a
cheap gimmick. but we have to have
something for people to identify
with WREL and WLUR can be
easily confused. Second, we really
are the University’s broadcast voice,
lt is the entity that holds our license,
Every radio station in the country
must be licensed to a group or in-
dividual by the Federal Communica-
tions Commission, The PCC assign-
ed WLUR's frequency to Washing-
ton and Lee.

Because we call WLUR the Uni-
versity'’s broadcast voice, Mr, White
seems to think we have an overrid-
ing obligation to program what the
student body wants. Nothing could
be further from the truth. Pach fi

censee has an obligation to serve the
“interest, convenience and necessity”
of its coverage area. If a station fails
to mect these guidelines, then its
right to broadcast is taken away,
WLUR's primary obligation is to
Lexington and Rockbridge County—
our coverage area, Of course includ-
ed in this area are the student
bodies of W&L and VMI. But they
aren't the only people who listen to
WLUR, We also have to serve the
faculties of the two institutions as
well as the local residents, We must
try to serve everyone,

Finally WLUR is licensed as an
educational station, Under this pro-
vision we are obligated to present
programming that is educational
and a public service. That is why we
carry programs about health, the
university, Blacks and current events,
These are the programs that Mr.
White seems to be objecting to, lt
is true that they probably don't ap-
peal to many students, but they are
a small part of the WLUR pro-
grams. Music in a “popular-contem-
porary” category takes up more than
half of our broadcast day. Classical
or serious music, on the other hand,
is only about 25 per cent,

Whether we like it or not, WLUR
has an obligation to fulfill, We know
that it is impossible to play every-
one's favorite record of program,
but we are trying to present a good
balance without settling for medio-
erity.

Ice Cold Checks

Over Fancy Dress Weekend ap-
proximately $200 worth of bad
checks were written by Washington
and Lee students, And the students
wonder why it is getting harder to

cash checks in Lexington and why so
much identification is needed. The
main purpose of the Student Finan-
cial Relations Committee, better
known as the Cold Check Commit-
tee, is to back such bad checks and
thereby keep up the students cash
checking privileges in Lexington.
Hoewver, the committee can do only
so much, The students themselves
must help by being more careful.

Most bad checks are written by
first time offenders who are careless
in keeping records or by chronic of-
fenders who eventually have to go
before the Executive Committee.
For those that keep bad records my
advice is to take a few seconds after
you write a check and put it in your
ledger. Also, at the end of the month
reconcile your statement.

If you do not know how to do
this, any of the Lexington banks
can show you as well as any mem-
ber of the Cold Check Committee.
Wf you take these small precautions
it will save you and the Cold Check
Commitice a lot of time and trouble.

Films In Review

‘Deliverance’ Thrills

To coincide with James Dickey’s
appearance on campus this week for
‘Contact?’ symposium, the film ver-
sion of his novel, ‘Deliverance’ be-
gins Wednesday at the State Theatre
for a two week engagement. —Ed,

By SKIP PAUKERT
Deliverance
Directed by John Boorman, with
Burt Reynolds and John Voight

To those of us who read Deliver-
ance when it first came out a couple
years back, it seemed to be one of
those novels which was written with
the film rights in mind. Here was a
book with a formula for success as
an adventure tale—four Atlanta
businessmen out for a weekend to
beat a white water river in the wild-
erness of northern Georgia. The
right themes were there—man vs,
nature, man’s law vs. the law of the
jungle—along with pure, unadulter-
ated action, with a littke sodomy
and murder thrown in for good mea-
sure,

It is obvious how all this, in the
wrong hands, could come off as very
trite stuff indeed, Fortunately, it was

Swedish exchange student Gunnar Ohlen,

in the hands of James Dickey, who,
through passages of sheer poetic de-
scription and a tight narrative, man-
aged ito make it all work.

Deliverance was blessed a second
time, when transferred to film, John
Boorman was chosen as the director,
Boorman deserves tremendous cred-
it for the difficult task of translating
Dickey’s flowing language into a
fast-paced, exciting movie.

And somebody’s coup was casting
Burt Reynold’s as Lewis, the he-
man survival nut who leads the
group. There is nothing very subtle
about Reynold’s performance, but
then again, there was nothing very
subtle about Lewis in the novel

energy conspire early on to convince
us of his rightness for the part.

Swedish Exchange Student
Views WGL And Future

By DOUG BURTON

Swedish medical students, like
their American counterparts, face
years of grinding pressure, and for
Gunnar Ohlen of Stockholm a year
at W&L is almost a year of rest be-
fore taking that plunge.

Of course he's too displomatic to
admit it. “I spend as much time on
my courses here as | would at home,
even though | will receive no credit
for them in Sweden,” he said, Stu-
dents who meet him notice immedi-
ately his Kissingeresque savoire-
faire. To no small advantage is his
excellent command of English, the
result of ten years of training in
school and the inevitable exposure
to American and British television
programming.

For a student who receives no
academic credit in Sweden for his
year at this University, Gunnar
spends a remarkable portion of his
time in McCormick Library. But
considering the sysiem Gunnar had
to beat in order to get into Med-
school, t's no wonder that he’s dis
ciplined. Competition among would
be physicians there is just the same
as it is in the U.S, with the sole
criterion for admission being a stu-

dent's grade point average—no
exams, no personal interviews.

Unlike most other European na-
tions Sweden has abolished compul-
sory eXaminations as a way of de-
termining which students will be
allowed to attend secondary schools
and which shall be given vocational
training. Another policy abandoned
is that of holding back those stu-
dents whose performance is con-
sidered substandard. Slow learners
are given special tutoring but re-
main with their peers, so that the
same children who begin school to-
gether at the age of seven will gradu-
ate from “basic” school en masse at
the age of sixteen,

Gunnar has been accepted at a
medical school in Sweden where he
will continue his studies next fall.
This summer he plans to cover as
much of the U. S, as possible on a
transcontinental road-trip. He came
to WAL to study Sociology and to
enjoy a different culture while he
still has the time,

Gunnar describes both his father,
a civil engineer for the Swedish gov-
ernment and his mother, an ortho-
dontist, as “workaholies.” He says

THE

RING-TUM PHI

 

B’Ballers Take 2nd;
Two Make All-CAC

By JIM MOZINGO

W&L acquitted itself well this
weekend at Sewanee, Tennessee, The
Generals finished the season at 13-
12, defeating a good Centre team on
Thursday, 86-74, and a surprising
Southwestern team Friday, 68-60.
These two games set up the cham-
pionship game Saturday — night
against Sewanee, who had swept its
earlier foes. The Generals played
well, and in the words of Coach
Verne Canfield, “finally put it all
together,” in the final game of the
season, Canfield has again put to-
gether another winner, no matter
how marginal, and says the team is
already looking forward to next sea-
son, (They'll begin working out again
in approximately two weeks.) De-
spite this the Generals were unable
to overcome a talented Sewanee
team on Saturday. Sewanee shot
66% from the field for the game,
most on medium and long range
jumpers and that’s hard to overcome
no matter how well you play.

WAL had several players who
made a big impression on observers
of the tournament, the foremost of
these being Senior Captain Paul Mc-
Clure and Junior Skip Lichtfuss,
both of who made the all-tourna-
ment team. Skip scored 67 points in
the three games at Sewanee, and
Paul ended his career at W&L with
an outstanding defensive perfor-
mance as well as 20 points and 12
rebounds Saturday night. He and
freshman Norm Kristoff did a tre-
mendous job on Sewance’s 7° Bill
Kosick, who was named MVP of
‘e tourney, primarily because of
his play against Sewanee’s first two
opponents, because McClure and
Kristoff held him to one of his worst
games of the season, fouling out
with 11:28 left in the game. The two
other men on the all-tournament
team were Sewanee players also.
They were freshman Eddie Krenson
and Senior Eddie Greene, the two
major factors in W&L's loss Satur-
day night.

But the road to Saturday began
back on Thursday night against
Centre, who came into the tourney
on a hot streak, The Generals man-
aged to rise to the occasion however
and put Centre down 86-74, Centre

got a shot in the arm for the tour-
nament with the return of all-CAC
forward Mike Pharriss. This was to
be his first action since February 9.

W&L had three players foul out,
Kerr, Croghan and Fitzgerald. The
loss of Hatton Smith was lightened
by the performance of yet another
of this years freshmen, guard John
Podgajny, who in his stint hit 4 of
5 shots from the field. The Generals
had their highest number of field
goals for the season in the Centre
game with 40; unfortunately their
performance from the line was an
anemic 6 of 18 (33%).

Friday night brought Southwes-
tern, a weak team most of the year,
to face the Generals, The Blue play-
ed a rather lazy game, and tried to
fritter the game away at times, but
managed to hold on with the help
of the 4-corners to win. The second
half remained close until the 12:57
mark when Lichtfuss and Kerr con-
tributed two fast break layups to
move the score to 48-40, From then
on the Generals held SWN at arms
length an dfinished the game at 68-
60. Lichtfuss got 26 and Clelan 12,
while McClure pulled down 10 re-
bounds.

But all these two games did was
set the stage for Saturday night's
championship game. Verne Can-
field's early season dream was finally
realized as he watched Norm Krist-
off and Paul McClure start together,
and both men did an excellent job.
The game opened like a two-man
show down between Paul McClure
and Sewanee’s Eddie Krenson, Both
had 10 points after the first 10 min-

es. With 4:05 left im the first half
Krenson had forged a 36-26 lead.
But at 4:05 Kosick picked up his
3rd foul, and 14 seconds later Licht-
fuss picked up his third. The half
ended at 46-36, with Kosick, Greene,
Bohrman, and Hoffman each having
three fouls for Sewanee, and Licht-
fuss, Kerr and Williams having three
for W&L. After only 2:19 of the
second half Kosick picked up his
fourth foul of the game. This had
been the W&L game plan, to fence
off Kosick with McClure and Krist-
off and to get him into foul trouble.

lhe fence worked well as Kosick,

Washington and Lee grapplers brought the golden bell back with them from “the Mountain.” Now Coach
Piper must choose his three top wrestlers, who will have the honor of participating in the NCAA’s,

Tankers Win Golden Bell;
Climax Fine 10-2 Season

By JIMMY BAIRD

The Washington and Lee Gen-
erals ended their season last week-
end with a convincing victory in the
College Athletic Conference swim-
ming championships. The team cap-
tured the CAC golden bell by de-
feating Sewanee of Tennessee and
Centre of Kentucky.

The swimmers joined the W&L
wrestling and basketball squads at
the University of the South for the
annual CAC winter sports festival,
which began on Thursday, February
22 and ended last Saturday .

The first day of competition de-
monstrated that the race for the
crown would be primarily between
Washington and Lee and Sewanee.
The Sewanee team got the firsts but
WA&L’s superior depth enabled them
to place more swimmers in 2nd,
third and fourth. The point total
after the first day was close with
Washington and Lee ahead by only
eleven.

The next day however, the Gen-
erals put everything together by not
only winning almost every event but
establishing new records in them.
The third and final day was icing on
the cake as the swimmers wrapped
up the championship, with victories
in the relays. All in all the tankers
broke 9 conference records and es-
tablished 5 school records while
three, Will Brotherton, Steve Erick-
son, and Bill Cogar, qualified for the
NCAA college division nationals.

Bill Tiers, a freshman from Vero
Beach, Florida, won the 200, 500,
and 1650 yd. freestyle, and estab-
lished conference records in both
the 500 and 1650. For these perofr-
mances, he was voted as the Out-
standing Swimmer in the Meet.

Will Brotherton also had an ex-
cellent meet by winning the 100 and
200 yard butterfly. He set confer-
ence and school records in both and
qualified for nationals in the 100.
He also swam on the medley and
800 free relay that set conference
records,

Junior Steve Erickson won the
100 and 200 yard backstroke, set-
ting new conference and school rec-
ords and qualifying for nationals in
the 100. Richard Kooh, a sopho-
more from Missouri was the third
double winner, He captured firsts in
the 100 and 200 yd. breaststroke and
broke the conference record in the
100, He also swam on the confer-
ence record breaking medley relay.
Bill Cogar, the freshman who won
the state championships a few weeks
ago, captured first in the one meter
diving and established school records
while qualifying for nationals in

both the one meter and three meter
diving.

The 800 yd. freestyle relay which
established a new conference record
was helped out by senior Alan Cor-
with and freshman Rob Seales, while
Gary Seldomridge anchored the
400 yd. medley relay which also set
a new conference record, Others who
placed and helped W&L bring home
the CAC bell were freshman Craig
Graham, John Henzel, Alan Petti-
grew; sophomore Jim Howard, Jun-
ior Tom Young and Sr .Aven Sharp.

Looking back, the season has been
a good one, Composed almost en-
tirely of freshmen and sophomores,
the team was not expected to get
going carly in the season. But Coach
Bill Stearns brought his team along
fast and tough. The Christmas break
was offset by many swimmers tra-
velling to Ft. Lauderdale for the
Swimming Coaches Annual Forum.

The Generals got back together
and carried their undefeated dual
meet status until they met with the
University of Virginia. The team
bounced back from that loss to a
victory over perenially tough V.M.1.
Hopes were high then for a win
over William and Mary in Williams-
burg, but the Generals were edged
by a single point. The following
week, the dual meet season ended
with the Generals carrying a 10-2
record into the Virginia College Ath-
letic Association state meet. W&L
had no problem getting that one,
and it enabled many of Stearns’ in-
experienced swimmers to have a
chance at showing their stuff. They
responded in admirable fashion.

It goes without saying, though,
that all eyes were on the Virginia
State Championship meet to be held
in Charlottesville the following
week. U.Va, was just out of reach,
but the Generals were waiting for
another chance at the Indians of
William and Mary. The swimmers
tried their very best. Twenty con-
ference and school records fell but
it Was not enough to overcome the
performances turned in by U.Va.
and William and Mary. So, although
the team swam their best meet all
year, they had to settle for third
place, Disappointment did not fast
long as the Generals swam another
good meet this past weekend to win
the CAC’s.

Individual performances which
highlighted the season are difficult to
pick out, However three Generals
qualified for the college division na-
tionals to be held in Detroit.

Bill Cogar, the freshman diving
sensation from Richmond, Virginia,
scored enough points to qualify
many times over the season. His big
accomplishment, though, was bring-
ing the state diving championship in
! and 3 meter competition home to
WAL.

Steve Erickson, who had such a
good season his freshman year, did
not swim last year, but came back
this year to swim better than ever.
He qualified for the nationals in both
the 100 and 200 yd. backstroke,

Will Brotherton, a sophomore
from West Virginia, was picked to
fill the big shoes of Bim Clark who
graduated last year.

Will, who excelled last season in
the middle distance freestyle races,
took on the job with guts and de-
termination. Swimming the 50 free-
style and butterfly events, he worked
all season, even swimming his old
races of the 100 and 200 yd. free-
style. It all paid off in the State and
CAC meets. In the state meet he
swam on all three relays which es-

Wrestlers Have
Six Champions:
End 13-5 Year

By KEN RUSCIO

Washington and Lee’s wrestling
team finished their season last Sat-
urday by capturing the CAC cham-
pionships at Sewanee, The Generals
received most of their competition
from the host college, however the
final score of 88-80 showed a clear
margin of victory. Centre and South-
western trailed in the scoring.

Coach Piper's squad overcame
the burden of plodding through sev-
eral preliminary matches to advance
8 wrestlers to the finals, Although
this number was matched by Se-
wanee, W&L held a 72-66 advan-
tage. Following the pattern of the
season, the lower weight classes pro-
vided the spark. Successive victories
in the finals over Sewanee were
provided by Don Overdorff (a su-
perior decision at 118), Lee Keck
(126), Dan White (134), and Bill
Melton (142). Jim Stieff kept the
streak alive in the 150 pound class
by defeating his Centre opponent,
All matches were decisive decisions
putting Sewanee in the difficult posi-
tion of having to win the remainder
of their matches to take the tourna-
ment, Their hopes vanished when
Centre defeated the Sewanee wrest-
ler in the 158 class.

Tension remained high, however,
as Doug Ford (167) went in the final
against Sewanee’s Lenahan, holder
of a 19-1 record. In the first period
Ford, the victim of a near pin,
trailed 4-0 and by the third period
was down 7-2, With a minute re-
maining Ford skillfully maneuver-
ed his way to a 7-7 tie, but Lena-
han’s one point riding time provided
the narrow margin of victory in the
tournament's most exciting encount-
er.

At 177, Sam Lewis won on a pen-
alty point over his Centre opponent,
but Dave Powers was pinned in the
heavyweight final. Other scorers for
WA&L were Fred Heldrich, fourth at
158, and Dave Knack, third at 190,

For Coach Piper's squad it was a
fitting climax to an extremely suc-
cessful 13-5 season which included

‘Deliverance’

(Continued from Page 2)
Ned Beatty, plays the easy-going,
guitar-picking Drew, and Ronny Cox
appears as an appropriately whiney
and clownish Bobby.

Dickey himself authored the
screenplay and appears briefly in the
last half-hour of the film, scratching
his red neck as the local sheriff.

All of these excellent perfor-
mances, however, could easily have
been wasted by sloppy direction and
photography. And, luckily, Deliver-
ance turns out to be the very model
of quality on both counts. Again,
Boorman deserves a gold star for his
action scenes—ttterly crisp and
breathtaking—as the four (all of
whom served, for the most part, as
their own stunt men) plunge down
the river admidst a tempest of white
foam and boulders, The sheer ele-
mental power of the river is com-
municated beautifully, The locale
for the shooting is absolutely au-
thentic; most of the filming was
done on the Chatooga River in the
North Georgia mountains (though,
as far as | could tell, the gorge
where Ed climbs up the cliff was
filmed at the Linville River in North
Carolina).

fhe photography itself is distine-
tively atmospheric. Here the colur 1s
grainy, vague, and monochromatic-—
lending a texture to the film which
fits the forested landscapes perfectly.

Well, what about the content of
the film? The themes are not hard
to get at—even her loveliness Pau-
line Kael saw that these men were
challenging nature “in search oi
manhood,” But there is still a little
more to Deliverance than that—the
river is to be flooded, rendered pow-
erless by a dam, and Lewis leads his
unwilling cohorts on one last chance
to challenge its force. “Why do you
wanna go down that river fer?” acks
the incredulous mountain man who
Lewis contracts to drive their cars
downstream. “Because it’s there.”
Lewis could have no other :eply.

Cliche? Sure. But Lewis, with his
wetsuit, his bow and arrows, and
survival pateh, is himself a cliche.

Despite its overall quality, the
film does seem to fall apart once
the men climb out of the river. After
that point, Voight is asked to carry
the show, and he’s simply not up to
it, So the film really doesn’t con-
clude: it just goes on and on for
the last half-hour, from scene to
scene, not really knowing where to
focus. Boorman even throws in a
perfectly awful dream sequence, in
which a shiny, blue (and very plas-
tic) hand rises out of moonlit river
io haunt poor Ed in his dreams.

But for the most part, Deliverance
is undeniably exciting and effective.
And perhaps the highlight of the
whole movie is that very early scene
where Drew and an impoverished
and deformed Appalachian boy joia
in a now-famous guitar-banjo duet.
The poignancy of that scene alone is
well worth the price of admission.

Although my letter is less exciting
than those you usually receive, it
may prove to be of more lasting in-
terest. On behalf of the Military
Science department and of the Stu-
dent Curriculum Committee I want
to direct attention to the fact that
beginning next year interested stu-
dents will be able to pursue two
semesters of American military his-
tory without attending drill outside
of class. The department has taken
this step so that anyone who wishes
may broaden his general education
without being committed to the
ROTC program. Other programs of
this sort are in the works, and in-
quiries may be addressed to Major
William Dragozetich or to me. Mili-
tary science for the non-ROTC stu-
dent should expand the offerings of

find meaningful.

averaging over 22 ppg and plus 14
rebounds, was held to 10 points and
6 rebounds, Despite this, Skip pick-
ed up his fourth foul at 15:31 and
helped nullify the advantage. Sewa-
nee’s Green hit a hot streak of four
baskets that was only stopped by his
fourth foul. Then came the big
chance, when Kosick picked up his
fifth with 11:28 remaining. The score
at the time was 65-52. Hoffman, an-
other starter was lost at 8:05 with
the score 71-59 Sewanee. But for
some reason the Generals were un-
able to take advantage of their
chances and Lichtfuss fouled out
with 4:36 left and the score 79-68.
WAL closed the lead to seven at
1:24 and 86-79, but 7 was as close
as the Generals were to get that
night as Sewanee and its 66% field

should remain all-male simply to
provide an alternative for incoming
freshmen who think they would pre-

think such an environment is suffici-

Brennan countered that his op-
position rested on two main points:
(1) that there was no compelling
reason to go coed for admissions
reasons, and (2) that the increase in
size necessary to implement the pro-
gram would be undesirable.

Hodges argued that the difference
between a student body of 1400 and
1800 would be “psychologically” in-
significant.

“Student opinion is

19 points and 10 rebounds, and
made the all-tourney team; and

Norm Kristoff scored 12 points and
snagged 11 rebounds in an excellent
performance not only for this game,
but for the entire tournament, Char-
lie Strain and Doug Clelan also put
on good performances as Charlie
got 11 points and Doug's floor play
held the team together, despite his
poor shooting night. But the real
story of the game was Sewanee’s
phenomenal shooting. Greene, who
had been averaging 12.1 ppg., took
advantage of the double-team on
Kosick to get 25 points and hit 12
of 18, But his performance still
played second to freshman Eddie
Krenson, whose 31 points led all
scorers, as did his 15 of 18 shooting
performance. Until Saturday Kren-
son was averaging 11.4 ppg. in the
shadow of Kosick, but when W&L
doubled-up on the big man Kren-
son went wild. The Generals played
well, and if Sewanee had shot closer
to its season’s average the game
might have been a whole different
story.

Gunnar Ohlen
Reacts to W&L

(Continued from Page 2)

that his own attitude toward work
is more moderate, especially this
year. While in the U.S, he considers
his studies secondary to his obliga-
tion to talk to Americans, a_ task
eased by a sheaf of Swedish public
information brochures,

Of the University he said, “I have
the feeling that a person can pick
and choose the courses he wants to
study, I think that some people gei
by without doing very much . . .
But | am very favorably impressed
by the Honor System. When I re-
ceived the pamphlet describing it at
home, | had mixed emotions.”

But now I see it as very positive.
Ican leave my pencils and books
someplace, and when | come back,
they are still there. | also have very
positive feelings about your system
of independent examinations.”

With regard to medicine Gunnar
sees a need to humanize the doctor.
“There are some cases in which
medical services have gone too far
into the technical side. A doctor pre-
scribes pills for a patient when what
he should do is sit down with him
and explain the problem on a_per-
sonal, grass roots level.” Whatever
Gunnar’s ideas about medicine are,
they will have ample time to grow.
He estimates that from the time he
enters medical school, his status as
a fully acoredited practitioner is a
full eleven years away.
