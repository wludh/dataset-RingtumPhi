‘Who’s Who’ Nominations Are Being Accepted

EC Discusses Financing Of Publications

By JOHN F. ZINK

Ihe Executive Committee, meet-
ing in a marathon session Monday
night, tackled the problem of allo-
cating the student tax among the
various publications; the committee
also heard from the various standing
committees and discussed the proce-
dure for nominating students to the
“Who's Who.”

Jim Beaty, chairman of Contact,
presented the financial status of his
committee by reporting that about
$3,700 was collected during registra-
tion. Bill Merrill, EC vice-president,
pointed out that this money must
be used to pay off last year’s Con-
tact debt. Beaty explained the need
for funds from the EC saying, “We
have planned our budget by assum-
ing that we would get money from
you.” He predicted a possible ex-

penditure of between $8,000 to
$9,000 this year.

The Calyx editor Pat Hinely, es-
timated this year’s budget at about
$14,660; he stated that the Calyx
would make about $5,000 and re-
quested $8,856 from the student tax.
Drew Staniar, Calyx business edi-
tor, promised a return to the style
of yearbook that will tell the story
of the school year. Bob Wilson,
Ariel editor, requested a budget of
about $3,600. Wilson explained the
additional $2,000 was needed for
the expanded efforts in the areas of
music, black culture, art, and the
theatre. Skip Paukert, editor-in-
chief of the Ring-tum Phi, predicted
a good year for the paper with an
upswing in advertising.

Bob Brennan, EC President, an-
nounced that the EC was accept-

Giammitorio says that the local
registrar has been somewhat hostile
to college students wishing to regi-
But, he added, students who
really want to register for the up-
coming election should not be “in-
timidated” by the local registration
procedure and should make a con-
crete effort to register.

Married students of W&L have
perhaps the best chance to register
locally, according to Giammitorio.
Those married men who are financi-
ally independent and who are from
within the state are more likely to
fall within the boundaries of the
elastic Virginia law to be able to
register,

The schedule for registration in
the Lexington and Rockbridge
County area is as follows:

The EC also heard from its stand-

nounced plans to recruit Virginia
area high school students in the
next few weeks. Bob Bruyere of the
University Center Committee said

“We are trying to coordinate student

The entire marathon EC meeting
lasted approximately three hours.

the omens of the public’s entrails

with followers in dusty jeans and

Editor Of ‘Calyx’ Explains Fee
Charged For Yearbook Portraits

To the Student Body
As you may already know,
today was the first day to have
your portrait shot for the 1973
Calyx. The posters around cam-
pus contain full information as
to time and place. On the bot-
tom of the posters you will no-
tice that there is a $3.50 charge
In the past, this matter has
always been left to solve itself,
and until year, always did
Last year, though, someone no-
ticed the discrepancy between the
catalog statement saying — the
Calyx is paid for in your tuition
and the fact that we charge each
student $3.50 for having his por
trait
1 will attempt to explain the
$3.50 charge and why you should
not mind paying it

cluded with tuition, but this is

My main worry is that many
of you will pre-judge the 1973
book on the basis of what the
1972 book was like. Don't do
that, It's a mistake, Last year's
Calyx was a work of art; that
cannot and should not be denied.
However, that book didn't really
have enough bearing on WAL,
the subject matter wandered too
widely

My goal is to create the 1973
Calyx with as much pure visual
uppeal, if not more, than the
1972 book, but also to bring the
subject matter much closer to
the school. YOU are the subjects
of the 1973 Calyx, That's why |

If you don't have your por

Perry Mason Bites The Dust

W hile io ol the

l'reshman Cam

sessions at this year’s Natural Bridge
ere pretty familiar to those who had gone

throug! il

before, one element was decidedly different. The

purpose, essentially, of returning to the off-campus orientation

was to render our peculiar honor system comprehensible to

who had

tudents never had experience with it before.

The Executive Committee took charge of this effort, and,
by all accounts, performed it well, If they can be criticized at
all, it would be for approaching overkill with their message.
the fre

sut limen themselves made the task all the easier by

being unusually attentive throughout the numerous and some-

times boring sessions.

Phe question is: Do upperclassmen really understand their
honor system?
Several revisions resulted from last year’s troubles with

the honot tem, the first being the return of the “lying,
phrase to the White Book, a second

Public

cheating, and stealing”
being the right of Freshmen to serve as jurors in a

hearing

The major change, however, occurred in the procedure ol
the Public Honor hearing. With the increased number of
these hearings during the last two years, it became clear that

what had dev loped Was an advet sary, courtroom-type proce

dure, inimical to the purposes of the honor system itself.
To quote from the EC directly: “Essentially the procedure
been changed from that of an adversary system to one in
vhich a body similar to the EC is selected at random from the
tudent body a list of fifteen students (as compared to the

previous list of fifty) obtained from the registrar. At the public

hearng this group of twelve is presented with the same set of

acts as was the EC at the initial hearing. From that point on
the ‘new EC’ investigates the case in any way they deem

ppropriate, e.g., calling any witnesses they choose, question

ing the accused, and reviewing any of the evidence gathered at
the first hearing, When this group has completed its investiga
tion, they adjourn to deliberate and reach a verdict, As in the

| Public

t, the decision of the Hearing is final,”

o Perry Mason bites the dust, and a new emphasis on
retting at the facts of a case has been established. In addition
he me cedure goes a long way toward bringing the ac
cused directly to his peers; though he may retain an advisor

vho can help him present his case in the best possible manner,

An Opposing Viewpoint

The ‘Pathetic’

Skip Paukert’s editorial in last
week’s paper, “For Tennis Freaks
Only,” came as a bit of a surprise
to me, at least in one respect. For
someone who has spent a consider-
able amount of time working in the
theatre especially in student
productions, | was surprised that
he could, in his initial editorial, be-
moan the lack of tennis facilities.
However, this article is not intend
ed as a poison-pen missive against

here,

Skip.

It is, rather, intended as a rebut-
tal of sorts to an editorial which
somehow, without even intending

to do so (L hope), expressed almost
perfectly a very depressing attitude
which seems to pervade this cam-
pus, or at least certain parts of it:
the almost total relegation of the
fine arts to a secondary status, with
little or no immediate value in a
student’s education, let alone as a
career possibility.

This attitude takes on a startling
physical form for anyone who has
taken a course in the arts. Over-
crowded art studios and slide view-
ing rooms, inadequate listening fac-
ilities and almost non-existent drama
rehearsal space,

No one can deny that tennis
courts are also needed, as are, I
suppose, new practice fields. But it
seems to me that in a_ university
those needs granted first priority
should be curricular needs. It has

become obvious to me that this uni-
versity’s administration has a very
different opinion of its priorities, al
least in the area of fine arts.

Plea For Studio S pace

Last winter, | had the privilege
of engaging in a series of rather long
conversations with a high admini-
stration official, concerning the acqui-
sition of a garage on Main Street
for studio theatre. The
theatre had been trying to acquire
this garage for at least three years
with either negative responses or
no response at all from the admini-
strauion.

This official began by confessing
that chances were again rather bleak
for acquiring the garage, which
prompted me to ask why, being the
inquisitive sort. Was it a matter of
money? No, he assured me that
money wasn't the problem, which
was nice to hear, since the rent was
only $260 per month. Well then,
what was the reason?

It turned out that this
didn’t to get tied
long-term lease as space could, mind
you, could become available within
the lease period, in which case the
university would be saddled with a
worthless building. Fine reasoning,
except that the lease requested by
for a mere three
years, which didn't seem very long-
term to me as one-third of it would
be up by this June. Especially con-
the dislocation which
come about when the various
annexes are torn down to make way
for the library, I didn't then
and still don't see were additional
space will become available for the

asked him an easier question, the
one asked at the beginning of this
essay

State of W&L Arts

 

Students enrolled in one of W&L’s studio art courses are forced to work in crowded conditions with little el-
bow room,

What, | asked, did he see as the

primary needs of this university,
curricular or non-curricular needs?
Curricular, definitely — curricular.

And are there enough facilities now
for curricular P.E, needs? Yes, he
thought that there were.

Then just how in_ perdition
covld this University defend
spending over a half-million dol-
lars for athletic facilities un-
needed by the curriculum in a
department which doesn’t even
eff'r a major and yet turn
around and refuse to spend
$209 per month for desperately
needed facilities in a depart-
ment which is struggling to offer
a half-way decent major?

Well, did I ever stop to think of
the number of people the P.E. de-

partment serves? Yes, | had, also
taking into account the fact that
P.E. is required. And had he, or

anyone for that matter, stopped to
think of just how many people the
fine arts could serve if they were
given half a chance? The argument
was lost upon him . . . | doubt that
it even had occurred to anyone else.

Howling In The Wind

At any rate, the garage is now
the Country Store and I realize now
hat all my seemingly solid argu
ments were to no avail. Citing large
enrollment increases in the arts

(check it out sometime), proposing
that lack of studio and rehearsal
space was analagous to studying

science without lab space (think
about it), everything | could think
of seemed to land on deaf ears,

This became all the more obvious
when the ten-year plan was announc-
ed without a single mention of the
arts, The relegation seems complete.

| realize, of course, that all this
is merely howling into the wind as
it would take something in the area
of an act of God to change the
ten-year plan. And it is howling
which | don’t have to be doing, as
| wouldn't be around to reap any of
the benefits were it successful.

It just seems to me that this uni-
versity, through its adherance to a
frame of mind which refuses to ad-
mit the arts into their rightful place
in a liberal arts education is not only
depriving many of its most talented
students of the chance to develop
fully their talents, but it is, in the
longer run, making a mockery of its
pledge to provide the best education
possible for all its students.

Need For Student Action

I realize tiat this university has
probably never even dreamed of de-
veloping a regional center for the
arts, (such as it plans to do with the
law school) even though the faculty
is capable of such an undertaking
But the least it can do is put the
fine arts on a level comparable to
the other departments and stop
treating them as an extra-curricular
area (there are careers in the arts).

It was once said, by a student
during the more radical 60's, that
substantive change would only come

Continuing through Sept

about when students stopped relying
on the arbitrary good will of the ad-
ministration. I'm beginning to think
that this student was correct, The
arts are in rather pathetic shape
around here and I suppose that one
of two things will happen. Either
the talented students and faculty in
the arts will leave for greener pas-
tures, thus eliminating any chance
for development in the arts. Or else
these people will get off their asses
and start letting their will be known.

It will be up to the students, as
there are no alumni in the arts, I
just hope that the depressing attitude

which pervades the administration
isn't pervasive among the student

body.

This is where

This cave of carnivores, of foot-
ball at its rawest, could be the only

zone defense for sore gains, and by

John Unitas, Slavic mountebank,
wilded all his tools of dark craft with
grey-haired cunning, casting the
gristle-grinding spell of running
backs Don Nottingham and Tom
Matte upon the Jets, forcing them
back as if from fire to their own
end zone, to acquiescence, and a
Colt touchdown, Baltimore now
trailed by only three points, and the
stadium seemed to quiver with ex-

touchdown. Once again the Colts
pull up close enough to peek over

stands at 37 to 34, and those good,
hard Ballimoreans in the stands
chant the litany of comeback.

Oleaginous Joe slinks on the field
with the offensive platoon, huddles
his men in deep planning, lines up
at scrimmage and signals the snap
of the ball. Then, as peremptory as

way with that cable-strong arm, a
pass incredibly once more into the
uncertain hands of Rich Caster,
who outlegged Rex Kern, the pray-
ing cornerback for the touchdown
and deathblow. Colt players and
fans were aghast with the sudden-
ness of loss.

After the game, both men met on
the field for the rump-patting ritual
of football affection. Joe Namath
completed 15 of 28 passes for 497
yards, six touchdowns, and victory.
John Unitas completed 26 of 45 at-
tempts for two touchdowns and de-
feat, But the teams, and those grand
gunslingers, will meet again.

Gasca, Santana-Miles Combo
Produce New Jazz Albums

By W. PAT HINELY
FOR THOSE WHO CHANT
Luis Gasca Blue Thumb BTS 37
CARLOS SANTANA AND

BUDDY MILES! LIVE!
Columbia KC-31308
Here are two new facets of the San
Francisco Chicano musician's fam-
ily. Luis Gasea is the man who
comes out most ahead from these al-
bums. For Those Who Chant was
recorded in two days in a studio, and
the Santana-Miles album was all
taped in the course of one afternoon.
So here is something new from
these folks: jazz. The musicians on
both albums are an amalgamation
from several groups around the Bay
area, and the new combinations
prove they're still improving and
expanding their styles.

A trumpeting duel between Gasca
and Miles Davis would end in a
standoff, Carlos Santana proves be-
yond doubt, with help from Neal
Schon, that pure acid rock didn’t die
with Hendrix. The Gasca album pro-
bably won't make it big in anything
but jazz, if there. It’s not rockish
enough for the average Santana lis-
tener, but probably too rickish for
the average jazz litsener, This is a
shame, because the album is a fu-
sion of two heretofore unfused types
of music, One can only hope it will
be recognized as the landmark it is.

The Santana-Miles album, on the
other hand, can’t lose, With Buddy's
soul and Carlos’ licks, there's some
thing here for everyone, Side 2,

 

“Free From Funkafide Filth,” with
Lyrics by Leon Thomas, is the best
full-side cut to come along since the
Dead's “Dark Star.”

Though Buddy Mile’s style actu-
ally hinders the rest of the percus-
sion more than helping it,
Escovedo and his timbales salvage
the overall sound of the band quite
effectively. If you listen hard, you
can forget the steady thump-thump-
thump behind some of the best live
music ever recorded. The main
drawback of the album is excessive
audience noise, but in a volcanic
crater, | guess it’s unavoidable,

Tune out the screams of the
crowd and Buddy's beatings, and
you'll hear why Santana is the most
dynamic group on the West Coast
these days.

Kenneth Clark's Civilisation
Continues Into~ December

If W&L is today what its prede
cessor was 150 years ago, a “focus
of elegant learning,” then it is en-
tirely fitting that we should be
treated during the next eleven weeks
to the now famous film — series
Civisliation, Sir Kenneth Clark’s
masterpiece of cultural — history,
which will be presented each Tues-
day night at 8 o'clock in duPont
auditorium, with admission free for
students, faculty, and (as they used
to put it) Lexington’s “miscellaneous
population.”

This unique film cycle unites bril-
liant and imaginative photography
with Sir Kenneth’s able narration,
sometimes moving, sometimes witty,

which manages to appeal to and
satisfy both intellectuals and peo-
ple. A delicate balance, that! The

audience is offered what must be the
most skillful and wide-ranging tour
of post-classical Western cultural
monuments ever put together. Such
an array of palaces, villas, churches,
libraries, galleries, and much more
-such a wealth of painting and
sculptures—such dazzling musical
accompaniment—surely no one is
entitled to so splendid a command

Settee ett tebeheteteettes

THE

of these riches as Sir Kenneth has
acquired, even in an art historian’s
career so distinguished as his!
Much of Civilisation’s enormous
merit arises from Sir Kenneth’s de
lightful performance on camera
Lord Clark of Saltwood, as he
should be properly styled, is a pro
tege of Bernard Berenson, the sage
of Florence, probably the most
civilized man of our century—and
Berenson’s pupil is as erudite and
cultivated as “B.B.” would have
wished him to be. Beyond that he,

is undoubtedly “a character,” as the
British so often are, certainly the
British elite. His turns of phrase and

his quirks and idiosyncrasies will
arrest an American's atiention, and
perhaps make Americans smile. Ad-
miringly, however,

One is often caught off guard, too,
by Lord Clark’s abrupt appearance
time and again ,on the screen, in the
unlikeliest places—at a lonely river's
edge, on a mountain crag (like Vic
ior Hugo), in a gaudy rococo Ger-
man opera house, or strolling very

possessively through Voliaire’s man-
sion. His impeccable dress, his in

Soccer Team Ties U.Va.,
Ready For Big Season

By PAUL CAVALIERE

The Washington and Lee Univer-
sity soccer team traveled to Char-
lottesville this past Sunday to serim-
mage the University of Virginia,
Washington and Lee came away
with a 3-3 tie against a team that
would not even put W&L on their
schedule for fear of an unimpres-
sively easy victory. The teams play-
ed three 45 minute periods. It was
evident that the W&L attack at
times lacked consistency. The Blue
started out slowly but improved as
the game progressed.

In the first period, Virginia, putt-
ing tremendous pressure on W&L
goalie Paul Devine with a fine at-
tack, scored on a shot by their right
inside. Washington and Lee could
only manage two unsuccessful shots
on the Virginia goal.

Coach Joe Lyles’s pep talk at in-
termission was effective as the Blue
stormed into the lead on two ex-
ceptionally fine goals by Jimmy
Foxx. W&L’s lead, however, was
shortlived as Virginia came right
back with two goals to snatch the
lead, 3-2, as the second period end-

ed, The third period saw Jim Foxx
score his third goal to knot the final
score at 3-3.

Physically the scrimmage was a
costly one for the Generals. Tri-
captain John Buckley © seriously
sprained his wrist, which must re-
main in a cast for two to three
weeks. Despite this John will be able
to work out with the team next
week. Peter Groover suffered a torn
cartilage in his right knee, an in-
jury that might possibly — sideline
him for the entire season. Several
other Generals sustained minor in-
juries.

The exhibition game did provide
our team with the opportunity to
match their talents with those of a
highly touted Wahoo squad. The
Generals found that they need more
drilling in soccer fundamentals. At
times the team was guilty of poor
passing, bad traps, and a lack of
communication among the players.
But at other times, Washington and
Lee displayed the characteristics of
a topnotch soccer team. “Right now
WAL is one of the best, if not the

(Continued on Page 6)

 

 

By PALMER TRICE

“When Washington and Lee’s men
fall in line,

We're going to win again another
time.

For W&L I yell, I yell, I yell,

And for the University | yell, I yell.

We will fight, fight, fight for every
yard,

Circle the end and hit that line
right hard,

And we will roll old Sweetbriar on
the side,

Yes, by God! Rah! Rah! Rah!”

Many people aren't aware of the
fact that the Washington and Lee
Swing is one of the most famous
“spirit” songs in the world. High
schools and colleges across the na-
tion have taken this famous tune and
all that it stands for, changed the
words, and claimed it as their own,

But the Swing did not become
famous just because of its booming
sound, There was an intense athletic
spirit that made it what it was.
Where that spirit is today, I'm not
sure,

College athletic spirit, as have so
many of this school’s traditions, has
been questioned, and apparently
thrown out, Change has been the
password for the past decade, and
it seems that this means that every-
thing old is invalid. Giving it the
“old college try” is no longer in
vogue at Washington and Lee, par-
ticularly in cheering your team on

Last Saturday saw one of the
Generals’ greatest victories in the
last few years, You'd never know it
from the crowd, Wilson Field looked
like a morgue. What has happened
to enthusiasm for one’s school? For
years, people have said that all the
school needed to regain this lost
spirit was a winner, Now we've got
two.

Why do people feel embarrassed

WEL's Spirit Is Missing

 

vy

when they want to cheer for their
school teams? I can understand why
you wouldn't want to start a cheer,
but why not join in? It can be real
fun. I've heard so many students
say “No, I don’t want to cheer.
That's so high school.” When you
grow up, do you abandon everything
that was yours in the past?

What has happened to the great
emphasis put on individualism? In-
dividualism means going your own
way. It doesn’t necessarily mean
that one has to avoid doing some-
thing that others are doing. Spirit
has its greatest impact when it is a
group effort, But this effort is only
so spirited as the individuals allow,
At the root, spirit is a personal
issue,

From the way it has been treated,
it would seem that school spirit, i.e.
cheering at a football game, is a
real chore. It isn't. Some of the
greatest moments in a college career
can be found in the stands on a
Saturday afternoon, Picture this: A
crisp fall afternoon. You have a
beautiful, good, decent date. Flask
is in the hip pocket. You are sur-
rounded by friends, and by people
who share the same “spirit” as you.
Down front, there’s a good ball
game. It may be old fashioned, but
this can be the scene for some great
times.

Many things can be done to create
a situation more condusive to school
spirit, The school could definitely
use a respectable recording of the
Washington and Lee Swing. Cheer
leaders and maybe a Spirit Club
might be beneficial additions.

But none of these will help, un-
less we have a change of heart. The
change must be one that takes place
in individual students. Only then,
can it become a trait of the school
as a whole.

Generals Win In Upset;
Grab 21-14 Victory From
Surprised Westminster

By LEWIS HIXSON

IUs going to be a good season for
Washington and Lee this year if
last Saturday's performance was any
indication of things to come. A 21-
14 victory over a nationally ranked
small college team is always a hard
act to follow, but that’s what the
Blue have looked forward to after
their comeback victory over the
Westminster ‘Titans last Saturday
here at Wilson Field.

After a rather sluggish first quar-
ter, the rest of the game belonged
completely to the Blue, It started
out with Westminster winning the
toss and after each team had ex-
changed punts, McNamera went to
work for the Titans. He drove his
team 78 yards in 9 plays with the
big gainer coming on a 45 yard pass
to Cole. The touchdown came on a
four yard burst up the middle by
Griffiths. McNamera added the
point after and with 6:51 left in the
first quarter the Generals had drop-
ped behind 7-0,

That wasn’t all the action in the
first quarter. After returning the
kickoff to their own 39, the Gen-
erals once again tried to get rolling.
However, they barely got going be-
fore misfortune struck as Bill Bald-
win fumbled a Fluharty pass and
Pontius recovered on the W&L 46,

This time it took the Titans just 6
plays to score as Fitts got behind
the Blue secondary to pull in a 34
yard scoring toss. McNamera once
again added the extra point, and with
4:13 still left in the quarter the Blue
were down 14-0, and the Titans
were looking very strong.

However, the Generals took the
kickoff determined to prove they
weren't out of it yet. Fluharty set
up shop at his own 25 and proceed-
ed to lead the Generals to the Titans
9 in eight plays. Following a 4 yard
loss, Fluharty elected to pass on
second and goal from. the 13, but
the bid fell short as the pass was in-
tercepted in the end zone.

Nevertheless, the Blue refused to
quit and Mark Diverio gave them
new life when he intercepted a Mc-
Namera pass and returned it to the
Titan 38 to open the second quar-
ter’s action. On second and 11 from
the 39, Fluharty flipped a short pass
to Jim Farrar, who broke three
tackles in route to the Westminster
3. Two plays later Fluharty sneaked
it over from the two. Doug Chase
blew the extra point, but the score
had been cut to a 14-6 margin. The
rest of the half was played between
the two 20's, with neither team be-
ing able to mount any sort of a
threat,

1972 Football Schedule

The second half began with the
Generals receiving the kickoff and
then losing the ball on a fumble at
the Titan 45, However, Westminster
was kind enough to reciprocate as
they gave it back at the W&L 25 on
a fumble of their own, Fluharty
then put the pieces together and
took the Generals on a 76 yard
scoring drive. He mixed passes with
runs by Van Amburgh and himself
to get to the Westminster 3, where
Van Amburgh plunged over. Coach
Leslie then elected to go for the two
point conversion to try and tie it up.
The Blue were successful as Conrad
took the 3 yard roll out pass from
Fluharty needed to knot the score
at 14-14 apiece. That's the way the
quarter ended as the W&L defense
continued to keep the Titans out of
scoring range.

In the fourth quarter the Titans
were the first to make a serious
threat, as they drove to the General
21 in 13 plays, before stalling with
a 4th and 11 situation. In came their
place kicker but his attempt at a
37 yard field goal fell short and the
Generals were able to breath a little
easier, It seemed like neither team
could gain an advantage until W&L
got a break late in the game. David
Turk intercepted a McNamera pass
and returned it to the General 49.
Fluharty then called three running
plays which netted only 7 yards.
This brought up a 4th and _ three
situation, at the Westminster 44, At
this point, Chappy Conrad told Flu-
harty that he thought he could beat
his man deep. With time out, QB
Fluharty went to the bench to con-

The play that followed can only be
described as possibly the most ex-

harty took the snap and faked into
the line drawing most of the Titans
defense to that spot, and then drop-
ped back and found Conrad all
alone downfield with a 44 yard
scoring pass, The play was remini-
cent of a similar call that occurred
in the October 15, 1969 Texas-Ar-
kansas game, which gave Texas the
national championship, Doug Chase
added the extra point and with only
1:59 left in the game, W&L was on
its way to a major small college up-
set. Two hurried attempts by the
Titans were laid to waste as Mar-
shall Washburn and Diverio inter-
cepted desperate passes.

Although the big plays always
seem to involve just a couple of
players, it must be remembered that
there are 11 men on the field. The
offensive line did an excellent job of
blocking for the backs as well as
giving Fluharty excellent protection.
Special commendation in this area
goes to Tackle Bob Brand. The de-
fense also must be congratulated as
they held the Titans scoreless in the

‘Civilisation’ Film Series
Is Clark’s Masterpiece

(Continued from page 3)
vincible aplomb, his knowing smile
which never quite turns patroniz-
ing: these are with him always and
everywhere, and many will ask at
the end of each film, ‘why can't I
be more like him?’

It seems today especially impor-
tant for students to absorb as thor-
oughly as possible and as_ intelli-
gently as possible some of the spirit,
and not just the barebones ‘history,’
of the West's cultural traditions,
This is so, partly because the techno-
logical revolution of the past 25
years dominates more and more
contemporary programs of education
—and the many comforts of modern
life will bring only faint joy to those
who do not know and cherish the
arts.

And partly because the cultural
relativism in vogue these days has
led to the deliberate discounting of
Western canons of traditional cul-
ture, in every field, among the in-
telligentsia on both sides of the At-
lantic. “Cultural chauvinism” is per-
haps the gravest of crimes in the
modern academy, and Lord Clark,
conservative that he is in matters of
taste and in many of his views,
would nevertheless be embarrassed,
very likely, to find his Civilisation’
defended on chauvinist grounds.

Let that be as it may; even so,
Zen Buddhism Hindu epics, and
(surely!) sub-Saharan sculpture will
never seem quite the same again
after Lord Clark's stirring portrayal
of our culture’s greatest moments.
Pride may be a sin indeed; if it is,
it is the most tempting one of all;
and the sons of Western civilization
can be pardoned for yielding to it.

Playing Politics
And Baseball

tobacco-chewing marine, have per-
formed creditable deeds in keeping
their teams in contention, with the
Yankee’s restoration a very welcome
surprise,

Through a humid east coast sum-
mer and into the late days of Sep-
tember, these clubs surged and
slumped at a bewildering rate. With
only a handful of games remaining,
no one team appears capable of
capitalizing on the weaknesses of
the other three.

Due to the lingering players’
strike, an uneven number of games
further clouds the eventual outcome.
There exists a distinct possibility

that no legitimate champion will
hack its way through the clutter
without incurring a stigma resulting
from the disrupted schedule.

Yet the much-maligned aspirants
plod onward to the accompaniment
of lusty cheers and embarrassing
jeers from their confused followers.
The season will soon stumble to a
close, leaving players and fans to
dream of a next year, mystical im-

petus of the summer game which
aging boys undertake with fond
passion,

Defeat finds comfort in the vic-
tories that have been enjoyed and
in those to come. Mediocrity of per-
formance can be forgotten, inept-
ness playfully heckled. Sadly enough,
the costly games of November,
waged by men of a difficult uniform
and skill, looms before the shaken
American public as a painfully simi-

lar spectacle of violated principles
and fallen causes.

People will forget the mediocrity,
or at least try, unless trapped by its
treacherously sublime impact; heck-
lers will raise cries in the direction
of the stone-eared, The President's
glorious mandate will deservedly
inspire four more years of direction-
less politics, following a credo strip-
ped of idealism, Cynics shall pros-
per, haunted not only by this year’s
mismatch, but by the upcoming
nightmare which proposes to pit an
outspoken vice president and a solid
aristocrat in ignoble struggle.

And I, with a mind battered into
retreat from reality’s stage, cast a
glance toward another summer, an-
other season, with hope, And de-
spair. The two are sweet com-
panions in an age which holds them
so cheaply.

best soccer team in the state,” said
Coach Lyles. “Every other ball club
has lost many players due to gradua-
tion, but we have lost no one. This
is the year for a championship soc-
cer team at Washington and Lee
University.”

Soccer opens its season this Sat
urday at Eastern Mennonite. The
following Wednesday the team has
its home opener with Madison Col-
lege. As was said of the W&L foot
ball team last week, this team will
be tested early, Championship cali-
ber demands that they look good all
year long, not just at the end of the
season, Madison and Eastern Men-
nonite just could tell the story of
the 1972 soccer campaign.
