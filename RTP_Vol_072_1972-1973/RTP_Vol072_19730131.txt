C Gives Recruitment Funds

The question of using student
money for the recruitment of stu-
dents was the focus of the Executive
Committee’s Monday night session.
In two separate actions the EC al-
located a total sum of $575 to be
used in recruiting programs by the
Student Recruitment Committee and
the Student Association for Black
Unity (SABU).

In both cases, certain members of
the EC—among them, Bill Merrill,
Rick Gray, and Archer Frierson—
were particularly reluctant to sub-
sidize programs which they believed
to be essentially the responsibility
of the administration.

The admissions office, however,
came under some strong criticism
during the meeting, and, ultimately,
both measures were passed to “send
a message” to the administration
that their efforts were falling short.
Both measures were voted also with
the stipulation that further funding
in future years would have to come
from Washington Hall.

Larry Evans, chairman of the stu-
dent committee, proposed a special
weekend to bring accepted “uder-
privileged” students to the W&l
campus. This. program would bring
eight such students, white and black,
sometime in March.

Rick Gray said he favored the
program as a one-year experiment

Mankiewicz Will Open
1973 Contact Program

Frank Mankiewicz, who recently
served as adviser to Sen. George
McGovern during his campaign for
the presidency last year, will open
the 1973 Contact symposium at
WAL on Feb. 28.

The topic of the former Peace
Corps official's lecture will be the
freedom of the press and the cur-
rent battle raging between the media
and government,

Mankiewicz has had experience
on both sides of the battle. He
began his career as a journalist for
the Los Angeles Times 25 years
deo

He joined the staff of the Peace
Corps during the Kennedy admini-
siration, serving in the organiza-
tion until 1966, Following this, he

became Robert Kennedy's press
secretary until the senator's death
in 1968.

From that time until he joined
McGovern’s campaign in 1971,
Mankiewicz worked as a_ political
analyst for a television station in
Washington, D.C.

Contact is an annual symposium
at W&L sponsored jointly by the
student body and _ Interfrateraity
Council of the University. The
symposium last year brought a num-
ber of well-known men tothe
university, including poet W. H.
Auden, Stewart Udall, Joseph He!-
ler, author of Catch-22, columnist
Nicholas von Hoffman of the Wash-
ington Post, artist Barclay Sneaks
and film director Philippe Labro.

As was the case last year, this
year’s Contact symposium will not!
be bound by a specific theme.
Rather, according to co-chairmen
Jim Beatty and Mark McMinn, ihe
program will feature a diversified
selection of speakers.

In the past, Contact has followed
specific themes in its symposiums.
Speakers who have appeared in the
past include Sen. McGovern, Sen.
Barry Goldwater, Sen. Mark Hat-
field, historian Henry Steele Com-
manger, and National Review's
William Rusher.

that would be picked up by the ad-
ministration, if successful. On this
basis, the EC passed the motion,
which had been defeated a few
weeks ago, by 10-0 with one ab-
stention, The $275 was appropriated
from the EC’s Reserve Fund,

The EC was also presented a
proposed budget by SABU, totaling
some $930 for recruitment, pub-
licity, cultural programs, and operat-
ing expenses. The budget was to
cover this year’s expenses only.

After it was decided to consider
the SABU request item by item,
the EC debated the question of

granting more funds for black re-

Newspapers can occasionally be
wrong, and this fact brought head-
aches to W&L administrators re-
cently when a Richmond newspaper
erroneously linked the university to

a bill sponsored in the Virginia
House of Delegates which would
have exempted  university-owned

faculty housing from being hit with
local property taxes. The paper later
retracted the charge.

The reason for the headaches is

that, in effect, the article in the
Times-Dispatch, dated Jan. 17,
identified W&L as a “special in-

terest” in connection with the bill.

In truth, any connection of W&L
with the bill wouldn't save the uni-
versity any money anyway, simply
because WAL does not pay any
property taxes as such. Instead,
WAL. along with VMI, pays what
is termed a “service charge” to the
city.

The charge amounts to one-hall
what would be the property taxes
for university-owned faculty hous-
ing. And W&L, according to Presi-
dent Robert E. R. Huntley, is very
congenial in paying the service
charge.

A bill, first proposing that such
charges be made legal was first
introduced by Del. Charles Gunn

members agreed should be assumed
by the Admissions Office.

Several students were on hand
to protest the giving of student funds
to a racially segregated organiza-
tion; arguments on this point were
avoided when SABU spokesman
Johnny Morrison announced that
the group would be open to any
student interested in furthering
SABU’s aims, “regardless of race,
creed, or color.”

Law representative Jeff Twardy
said that if the Executive Commit-
tee funded the recruitment effort,
then SABU would be expected to

According to President Huntley,

officials on the bill, and the uni

consented to the bill,

The Times-Dispatch article link-
ed W&I. with the tax exemption
bill, which was sponsored by Del.
A. L. Philpott of Henry County.
WAL denied the article, and a re-
traction was printed a week later
in the Richmond paper.

paid $4278 las tyear to the cily

administrator Frank Parsons, W&IL.

four units from the list of those

Del. Gunn also denied WE&L's
connection with thre Philpott bill,
calling the Times-Dispatect article

vette.

The bill, imeidentally, failed to

pass in the House of Delegates.

OUTLOOK and REVIEW
Tightwads On The EC

In a humdinger of a meeting last Monday night, the mem-
bers of the Executive Committee passed judgement on the
budgetary requests made by the Student Association for
Black Unity (SABU).

What was singularly impressive about this session, at least
from our point of view, was the manner in which it was
handled, Considering the issue at hand and the forces involved,
all the makings were there for a really vituperative, knock-
down-drag-out contest. That the proceedings remained on a
relatively restrained and reasoned level is much to the credit
of both the EC and the members of SABU.

What the events of the last few weeks have demonstrated,
if nothing else, is that the question of Black recruitment (and
recruitment in general) is extremely complicated, and, at the
same time, extremely sensitive. The Mencken Law of Dis-
course seems to apply: no matter what you say, it’s going to
make somebody angry.

In light of the disappointments concerning the diminish-
ing numbers of blacks coming to W&L each year, it was
inevitable that the issue would come to the fore. It was also
inevitable that the emotionally rarified atmosphere which
accompanied it would cause a great deal of confusion.

Take, for example, the reaction of some white students
on hearing that the EC was to consider funds for the Black
SABU group. Suddenly, there were excited protests about
doling out dollars to “special interest groups.” There was
even talk of a law suit to prevent appropriation of funds to
a racially segregated organization.

Fortunately, SABU spokesman Johnny Morrison defused
this line of action by quickly announcing that SABU would
henceforth be open to all Washington and Lee students
interested in furthering SABU’s aims, regradless of their race.

But the mere fact that people were so prone to react in
such grandiose fashion is cause for some concern.

It was somewhat reassuring to find the EC capable of
focusing on the really pressing aspects of this problem. First,
what is being done in recruitment and by whom? Second,
why has the initial success in this arear declined so mark-
edly? And third, is it in the province of the student govern-
ment to fund what are (or should be) essentially Admissions
Office projects?

There were, in fact, two distinet requests for recruitment
money before the EC. One was for $275, requested by the
predominately white Student Recruitment Committee—this
to provide for a “Recruitment Weekend” in the spring, dur-
ing which some eight underprivileged students (white and
black) would be brought to campus. The second request was
part of the SABU budgetary proposal, to pay expense for
black W&L students to travel independently to various high
schools, specifically to recruit black students.

The EC took a long hard look at both proposals: to make
sure (1) that these two efforts would not be at cross-purposes
or overlapping, (2) that such efforts would be funded, after
this year, by the administration itself, Ultimately, the com-
mittee approved both requests.

What the EC did not approve was the remainder of
SABU’s proposed budget, which would have provided operat-
ing expenses for the group other than those directly required
for the recruitment project. The members of the EC ascer-
tained that to do so would be setting a dangerous precedent
with regard to other such organizations on campus, which
presently rely on membership support for these resources,

All in all, some fine distinctions were made—distinctions,
however, which were essential to prevent more confusion in
the future. One EC member asserted that the group was being
more rigorous in its serutiny of SABU's plans than it had
been of other activities during the course of the year.

This has hardly been the case. As anyone who has re-
quested EC money knows, this operation is, more often than
not, like pulling teeth, Even routine allotments to publica-
tions and other established activities from the Student
Activities Fee required two marathon meetings at the year's
start. :

What we have sitting on the Executive Committee ts a
bunch of tightwads. And this is precisely as it should be,
The United States Congress excepted, most governmental
bodies are, at least nominally, conservative with the tax dollar,
So when the EC is charged with dispensing with students
funds wisely and effectively, it is right that they should do
so with care and deliberation—even if it takes a little extra
time and patience, —N.ELP,

Activism On The EC

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

This past Monday, the Executive
Committee voted to fund the Stu-
dent Recruitment Committee and
the Student Association for Black
Unity in their respective endeavors
to increase recruitment of under-
priveleged and minority students.
The EC reserved a right of account-
ing over both allocations drawn out
of the Student Body Reserve Fund.
The allocations do not in any way
reflect EC approval of annual fund-
ings of the organizations aforemen-
tioned, nor, for that matter, any
other similar student organizations.

These allocations, however, touch
two issues of substantial interest to
the entire University community, In
the first place, the EC finally took
a candid view of its reason for be-
ing and decided that it could indeed
represent students dynamically,
rather than in dogmatic, tradition-
oriented fashion, My thanks and
applause to my fratres in universi-
tate. Is there a light at the end of
the tunnel?

Secondly, the EC (once again for
the first time in memory), directly
challenged the administration re-
garding what would seem to be
an inflexible minority recruitment

effort. Dean Farrar’s January 4
statistical account of minority re-
cruitment in prior years made be-
fore the University Council can best
be described as pathetic. It is this
writer’s hope that the EC’s action
will result in a wide-ranging exami-
nation of admissions procedure and
structure, resulting, if needed, in
substantial reorganization of that
structure, Considering efforts now
being expended nationally on mi-
nority recruitment, and considering
former and current inadequate pro-
grams at W&L, isn’t it about time
that the administration admits
failure?

It is claimed that this liberal arts
institution is broadly based. Nice
words, but how broadly based is
the student body? Our approxi-
mately one-percent minority student
population is certainly a fine ex-
ample of tokenism at its worst. To
be broadly based and relevant as
a “university,” maybe, just maybe,
we might consider a broadly based
(and relevant) student body. And
that includes minority students, And
they include blacks.

We may still be General Lee's
College, but the General's been dead
for over a century!

Sincerely,
Jeff Twardy, ‘73 Law

More From White On Black Recruitment

The last time that | wrote what
was on my mind, other people were
caught up in a controversy that they
didn’t need or ask for. So that there
can be no mistakes this time, the
views given are my own and I
should be the one that you try
to intimidate,

Enough on small matters, let us
get down to the real problem. The
present recruitment policy toward
minorities is almost a complete dud.
In the last two years, only six
blacks enrolled here. That is not a
good job, that is a poor job, and
cannot be called anything but. The
New Orleans Saints work hard, but
they don’t win games and its on
that criterion that we judge a good
job or a poor one, winning or los-
ing. Our recruitment program in
this area isn’t batting .500. We really
should be trying something else.

The problem is that right now
we are at odds as to what constitues
a bright young black student. |
think that I know him better than
you do, and you disagree with me.

My argument is that the lack
of knowledge about this type of
student is what is the center of the
recruitment problem. You are using
the wrong methods to both locate
him and evaluate him if you hap-
pen to stumble across him. First
you look for him in the wrong
places, places that are secure for
you—prep schools, academies, and
“white” public high schools. He's
not there, he’s somewhere else, and
you're afraid to go there. Secondly
he’s not readily detected by the
things that you use to find students,
Board scores won't help you, grades
might, but they probably won't, and
the special agencies that you call
in won't either, to tell you the
truth. The reason is because these
things might be nonexistent for him.
If they aren't low, then they are
not complete.

And the assumption is that if
they are either low or incomplete
then the person involved can't be
worth much, This is where you are
wrong! He might be worth many,
many more times the price of gold,
but we will never get to know
will we? Did you ever ask yourself
why? He could be the product of a
poor inner city school that really
doesn't care how he gets along.

Terrible you say, but aren't you
just as bad by not giving him a
chance to better himself. The
United Negro College fund's slogan
is “A MIND IS A TERRIBLE
THING TO GO TO WASTE.”
Isn't that what we are doing when
we ask that a student from this
type of environment be judged on
the same level as a “white prep
school student.” This is a shameful
way to use the principle of de-
mocracy.

Mr. editor, | hit you the last
time; I'm not sorry for what |
said. Many people that | loved
died so that | could come to a
school like this one day, They
fought for me: Now | Must Fight
For Them.

Instead of the wasteful policy that
we have now, we should be trying
to find people who would appreci-
ate the opportunity to attend an
institution like WAL,

This is where the problem be-
comes acute, Many people say that
to do this would mean a “lowering”
of the standards of Washington and
Lee at great cost, I find those posi-
tions both false and irrelevant, A
lowering of the standards is done
now and the reason behind it is
money. Why, if need be, can't we
“lower” the standards for a reason

like the education of oppressed
people, or the betterment of society,
aren't they just as valid? Is the
love of money really that important
to a school that is as comfortable
as this one?

This type of student, the one
that doesn’t want to go to Harv-
ard, wants to go anywhere. He
doesn't have the qualities that we
look for in a student. Those quali-
ties are the ones that you put on
paper, grades, test scores and the
rest of the ego material. This kid
wants to get ahead, has the talent
to get ahead, but lacks the op-
portunity. Why can’t Washington
and Lee give him that chance?
| think I can find him for you
better than you can, because I used
to be one of those guys.

The question is are you willing
to accept him? He’s not as “intel-
ligent” as you, nor as urbane in
many cases, he’s “poorer” than you
are and above all he’s different. Are
those things strong enough to keep
him out? At the present they are,
do they have to be that way always?
It's not going to hurt you financi-
ally one damned bit, and any man
that says it will is a liar, We have
the money when we want it so
why can’t we have it now,

The whole apporach must be
changed concerning black students,
figures and test scores are irrelevant,
grades are too, even class rank
and the rest are not the most
accurate sources, because they don't
even measure what they are sup-
posed to measure accurately let
alone things like desire and motiva-
tion,

| might be an idealist, but I'm
convinced that at least that way |
could have some respect for my
institution as one that was receptive
to human needs rather than a money
oriented power mad ideology.

Mr. editor, | hope that what |
have written is worth another state-
ment by you. Are you against the
policy that | have laid down? The
vitriol is gone, so don't make light
of the issues, give me and the rest
of the student body another sampl-
ing of your abilities.

To the other people that are in-
volved in this matter I would like
to hear from you, | have a much
thicker skin than you obvisiously
have so | am waiting to hear
from you as well, Remember, when
you have to look up a particular
subject, that you don't know very
much about you go to the library,

Letters To The Editor...

Are Art Courses ‘Gut’? .

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

I want to address a few com-
ments on the situation in the art
department. I speak not as an art
major but as a member of the
general undergraduate student body
who has taken three art courses,

By now most students have heard
that the art department is adopting
a much tougher grading scheme in
response to criticism that it is lax
in grading. Let me preface my
comments with a review of the
facts, my having been present at the
Arts Council meeting of 17 January
and at the confrontation which took
place 25 January in Art 308. The
Arts Council meeting was set up
by Ken Lane for the purpose of
bringing together various groups of
people interested in improving the
fine arts at W&L. Present were Dr,
Stewart, Dr. Doyon, Mr. Kahn,
Dr. Pellicciaro, Ken Lane, Deans
Watt and Pusey, along with num-
bers of students ranging from 20
to about 35,

The remarks by an art major
which precipitated the changes came
in the context of a conversation in
which the art majors (several being
present at the time) were complain-
ing that their department devotes
more time to the non-art-major
than to those students with a speci-
fic interest in art.

They mentioned that there are no
upper level courses designed for the
art major, and that there is no
orderly progression in the study of
art history, i.e., any student can take
any course at any time without pre-
requisites. They seemed to feel that
the quality of instruction was
“watered-down” to meet the needs
of the general student, and that they
were not getting the special atien-
tion which they deserve.

Then came the fatal remarks—
“I'm ashamed to be an art major,”
and “The are department only has
gut courses.” Dr Doyon was visibly
embarrased by this. transaction.
Later the conversation shifted and
I left, shortly before Dr. Doyon
walked out.

The next week in a highly emo-
tional scene Dr. Doyon revealed

:

“VD BNA,
“UPR AND

that he had been taken to task by
the academic deans for the utter-
ances of his student and he was
instigating strong measures to in-
sure that the art department lose
its reputation for being “gut,” in
order that he may “hold his head
up among faculty.”

Several points are at issue, not
withstanding the validity of the art
majors’ complaints. | think one of
the problems is the inability of the
art student to clearly articulate their
dissatisfaction and to suggest precise
remedies: the Arts Council was
fogged by the ramblings of some of
the most inarticulate people I have
ever heard.

However, the major issue is not
what the students had to say but
what the Deans had to say. In my
opinion the Deans went overboard
and attached too much significance
to the rash words of one student,
They were too zealous in repri-
manding a fine teacher, causing him
in turn to act rashly, The real
question is how much does Wash-
ington Hall dictate how a_profes-
sor grades?

The ramifications of the Deans’
“suggestion” to Dr. Doyon go far
beyond the art department; it should
be a matter of concern to all teach-
ing professors. The academic de-
partment is the organizational back-
bone of the university, and if the
preogatives of the department chair-
men are impinged upon by outside
forces, then it is a serious threat
indeed to academic freedom. The
helplessness of the student, shut out
of the decision making process, is
apparent in crises such as these.

I hope Dr. Doyon repeals his de-
cision to grade the class on a strict
bell-curve basis. The old question
of grades as an indicator of success
is once again brought out, with the
Deans obviously on the side of
grades (preferably bad). The ex-
cellence of a department is not
measured by the grades it gives.
The student body should support a
man, whose ability to teach is un-
impeachable, from unjust meddling
by Washington Hall.

Griff Steel, °73

Macabre Movies

By BILL McILHANY

The first in a proposed series of
motion picture showings of the most
characteristic fantasy, science-fiction,
and horror movies from the pasi
will be held this Saturday night,
February 3rd, at 10:00 p.m. in du-
Pont Auditorium,

The two films scheduled for this
weekend are sponsored by the Uni-
versity Center Committee and are
quite rare and distinctive examples
of two very different kinds of hor-
ror movies,

The first film is “The Undertaker
and His Pals.” Produced in color
in 1966 by Alex Gratien for Bola
Pictures, this movie in an unfor-
gettable member of a series of
films which have developed since
Roger Corman'’s “A Bucket of
Blood” almost a decade and a half
ago.

Written and not-well-directed by
L. C. Swicegood, “The Undertaker
and His Pals” tells the story of a
mad undertaker who only charges
$144.98 initially for a funeral, He
is guaranteed continual customers
by his psychotic pals.

Together they operate The Greasy
Spoon Diner and merchandise por-
tions of the patronage they create
for Morte the undertaker. This
cynical, “sick” comedy aliernates

silly jesting with some of the most
visually explicit mutilation murders
ever included in a film,

There is a cameo appearance by
that star of many a mystery, serial
and horror movie in the 1940's,
Robert Lowery, Ray Dannis’ por-
trayal of Morte the undertaker is
also notable,

Johnny White's soap opera music
makes the audience tense in ex-
pectation of the film's delightful
climax, Andrew Janezak’s photo-
graphy is best and accidentally most
effective in the night scenes,

The second film to be shown
Saturday is the 1954 production of
Maurice Sandoz’s The Maze, star-
ring Richard Carlson, This film is
unusual because of the powerful
effect of its grim, gothic, dramatic
atmosphere—every bit as expressive
of Sandoz’s novel as were the origi
nal illustrations by Salvador Dali
which accompanied it,

A man leaves his home to inherit
a huge castle and grounds left to
him by a departed relative, Strange
events occur after his arrival, lead-
ing up to his final discovery of the
truth concerning his late relative,
the curse allegedly carried by the
family, and the terrible secret of the
castle's gigantic garden maze

Admission for these fila

is $1,

By KEN RUSCIO

Amidst the excitement of basket-
ball, the success of swimming and
wrestling, and the beginning of base-
ball and lacrosse training, the Wash-
ington and Lee track team quietly
began its season last Thursday night
in a five team meet at the V.M.1.
fieldhouse. Coach Norris Aldridge
revealed a team with potential to
attain significant honors, Placing
third behind a_ well-conditioned
V.M.I. contingent and a surprising
Christopher-Newport team the Gen-
erals served notice that their con-
ditioning program is right on sched-
ule. At this stage the team is in the
agonizing process of early season
training providing for a “peak”
sometime during the late outdoor
season,

Nevertheless, there were some
notable performances Thursday
night. Paul Suthern returned after
a year’s absence to win the 60 yard
high hurdles in the quick time of
7.8 and also take a third in the low
hurdles. Paul Hartmann grabbed
another first for the team by vault-
ing 12 feet. Second place finishes
were recorded by freshman Mark
George (high jump) and sophomore
Barclay Armstrong (long jump).
Armstrong came back to take fourth
in the triple jump.

In the distances Bill Kalal gave
indications of a promising season by
taking a close third in the two mile.
Marathoners Mike Burns and Doug
McNeel were still feeling the effects
of their latest 26 mile ordeal but
were not far behind, Co-captain
Bob Sherwood found the mile field
a little too rough but was pleased
with excellnet early season time of
4:39, The distance team, however,
would be greatly aided by the re-
turn of Stu Nibley, who is being
restricted to modest training due to
an achilles tendon injury.

The mile relay, the last event of
the evening, and appropriately the
most competitive, was clearly the
highlight of the meet, From the
start it was all VMI and W&L with
Christopher-Newport, Lynchburg,
and Madison well out of the race.
Dave Estes, Phifer Helms, and Dave
Lawson turned in excellent splits
giving the anchor leg a small deficit
to overcome on a class VMI team.

Then Brandon Herbert, coming off
a narrow loss in the 600 yard run,
took over. In the end, the Generals
had missed by inches but gave proof
that in the very near future (per-
haps this Saturday at the VMI re-
lays) this determined unit will be
looking back to find most of its
opposition.

Notable meets on the agenda for
this year’s indoor track team will
be the Lynchburg Relays (Feb. 24),
the State Meet (Feb, 28 at VMI)
and the VCAA _ championship
(March 3).

Tankers Up Record,
Warm Up for VCAA

By CLIF OVERCASH

The Washington and Lee swim
team upped its record to 9-2 last
week, beating Lynchburg 64-47 and
Roanoke 71-40 on Thursday, and
losing to William and Mary 57-56
on Saturday, Jan. 27. The dual meet
against Roanoke and Lynchburg pro-
vided Generals fans with a preview
of the upcoming Virginia College
Athletic Association Meet to be held
in Doremus Gym February 9 and
10. W&L, with many top swimmers
not participating, easily won the
meet and eagerly anticipates bring-
ing home the Virginia small college
trophy. Top performers for the Gen-
erals included Jim Howard in the
backstroke, Mike Moore in the 1000
free, Craig Graham in the 200

Grapplers Win 2 Out of 3;
Up Year's Record to 7-4

The W&L grapplers hosted this
last Saturday a big Quadrangular
Meet, and came out of it very
well. Opponents for the weekend
included the University of North
Carolina, Furman, and VMI. The
Generals had little trouble handling
their opponents from down south,
as they dumped the Tar Heels 35-6,
and easily handled the Purple Pala-
dins 26-9, But things weren't so
easy when the Blue took on their
cross-town rivals. The Keydets have
a strong team, and were out for
revenge, after their swimming com-
patriots had been swamped by the
Generals. The final tally gave VMI
a 21-14 victory.

The Quad Meet was marked by

several outstanding performances,
Dan White (134) came up with wins
in all three matches. Jim Stieff (150)
grabbed three triumphs, including
pins over VMI and UNC. Don
Overdorff (118) won two and tied
VMI.

On January 19-20, the Generals
had traveled to the Tar Heel state,
where they had split two matches.
They edged Davidson 22-18 and lost
to NC State, 24-14.

This Saturday, the Blue host
another big Quadrangular Meet.
Virginia Commonwealth University,
Campbell College, and Pembroke
will all take on the Generals at 12
in new Doremus Gymnasium.

breaststroke, and Billy Cogar in the
diving,

On Saturday the team traveled to
Williamsburg to face the Indians
of William and Mary. William and
Mary finished second in the state
meet last year to W&L’s fourth, and
the Generals knew they had to swim
their best to win,

The first event, the medley relay,
was won by W&L’s team of Steve
Erickson, Rich Koch, Bill Broth-
erton, and Jimmy Howard, Other
WL first places went to Brotherton
in the 200 fly, Erickson in the 200
backstroke, Cogar in the 1 meter
required and optional diving, and
the 400 free relay team of Robbie
Searles, Alan Corwith, Aven Sharp,
and Howard. Strong performances
by Searles in the 200 individual
medley, Bill Tiers in the 100 free,
and Tom Young and Gary Seldom-
ridge in the 1000 free could not
overcome the powerful Indians and
their one man show—Joe Acker-
man, who won the 1000 free, the
200 1.M., and the 200 breaststroke.
By the end of the meet, the Gen-
erals found themselves on the short
end of a 57-56 score.

On February 9-10, Washington
and Lee will host the V.C.A.A.
State meet. Teams participating in-
clude Roanoke, Lynchburg, Bridge-
water, Hampton Institute and Ran-
dolph-Macon, W&L head coach Bill
Stearns believes that “we're the team
to beat in the VCAA.” The next
weekend is the Virginia State
Championship meet, and W&L
would very much like to revenge the
loss to the Indians, This should be
quite an exciting meet.

Hoopers Split Pair,
Look To Bridgewater

By JIM MOZINGO

Washington and Lee split its two
games this past week, defeating
Madison College 65-57 on Wednes-
day night, and losing to Virginia
Union in a particularly hard fought
contest 72-70. Despite the Generals
8-9 record they are beginning to
play the basketball that many have
expected of them all year long.
With the exception of the first half
of the Madison game, Verne Can-
field’s charges have played solid
basketball.

The first half of that Madison
game had the fans in an uproar
because of the ineptness shown by
both teams; in fact it was so
contagious that it spilled over into
the officiating, which never did seem
to recover. The game began with
WAL controlling the tip and for the
next several minutes the game
consisted of W&L shooting and
tipping wildly at one end, Madison
finally controlling the ball, dribbling
to the other end of the floor where
they were hounded by a tenacious
defense. The ensuing floor scramble
for the ball usually resulted in a
Madison turn-over, The fans grew
gradually more restless as neither
team could move effectively on
offense. In fact, I’ve seen higher
scoring first halves at football
games. Though the Generals offen-
sive efforts were continually blunt-

ed, the Dukes were even worse,
One spectator ventured that the
“Madison cheerleaders mounted

more of an attack” than their team
did in the opening minutes of the
ball game.

McClure scored for W&L at
18:04, the first of his 13 points,
The Generals allowed Madison little
room to manuever in, but Madison
returned the favor at its end of
the court. The Dukes finally got
their first point at 13:55 of the first
half, over six minutes after the
opening tip-off. But W&L’s offensive
play had been so atrocious that the
foul shot made the score 8-1, For
the next two or three minutes
Madison outscored the Generals 6-
1. The Dukes began to score in the
middle as W&L's shooting got
colder, if that was possible, Skip
Lichtfuss was forced out of the
game at about the 8:00 mark with
a minor injury. Now instead of
working towards Lichtfuss, the Gen-
erals worked to Guy Kerr's wing.
However about the only bright spot
in the scoring came when Madison's
coach was freely given a technical
foul, allowing W&L’s only legiti-
mate foul shooter Doug Clelan to
make one from the line. The inept-
ness continued, sporadically inter-
rupted by more ineptness as Madi-
son’s cheerleaders got into the act,
The half ended at 22-20 in favor
of the Dukes.

The crowd was particularly vocal
this night, even more so than
against Rollins, spurred not only by
the horrible play on the court but
by a large contingent of Madison
students. Coach Canfield should be
happier now, as earlier in the sea-
son he had questioned the backing
of the student body. Even if they
were critical at least they returned
for the second half in which a much
better brand of basketball was ex-
hibited,

The second half began propheti-

cally as Bowman Williams hit from
30 feet. Lichtfuss got hot and Mc-
Clure began to dominate the boards,
This was to be another night when
the Generals were to get a boost
from their outstanding freshman
Gary Fitzgerald. The Generals de-
fense constantly hounded Madison
into turn-overs and bad shots. As
the time on the clock waned the
Dukes began to come apart at the
seams. Washington and Lee went
into its four corners at 2:17 to in-
sure a 65-57 victory over the Dukes.
Lichtfuss got 20, Clelan 12, and
McClure 13.

This left W&L looking toward
Saturday night when they would get
the chance to break .500, However
this was not to be. The Generals
ran into an extremely physical Vir-
ginia Union team and couldn't quite
get over the hump. The Generals
were betrayed by the foul shooting
which has hurt them all year long,
as Virginia Union out-fouled them
22-14, But not only did the Panth-
ers have the W&L foul shooting and
their own muscle, but an excellent
and seemingly inexhaustable bench.
The Panther starters only accounted
for 32 of the 72 points the team
scored, Sam Lockhart came off the
bench to provide a constant thorn
in the Generals’ side, scoring 20
points from just about ever imagin-
able spot on the court, Another
interesting aspect of the Panthers
was that senior guard and three-year
letterman Andrew Hazley seemed
to coach the team much of the
time. This was especially evident
during time-outs.

But whatever Hazley told his
teammates seemed to work, as they
fought back from behind despite
numerous errors which the Generals
were unable to take full advantage
of. Virginia Union was especially
tough where W&L likes to get most
of its points, inside. All night the
Generals had trouble controlling
their own boards, much less getting
a second shot on offense. As the
game ground to a close, both teams
were playing strong basketball.

With 0:15 left on the clock W&L
missed a shot inside that would
have tied the game. The Panthers
