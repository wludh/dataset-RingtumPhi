The Need For Needed Change

Last week's restructuring of the old University Center Com-
mittee by the 1973-74 Executive Committee is a welcome move.
Many of the problems of the old committee have been elimi-
nated, at least on paper, by the establishment of the new Stu-
dent Activities Board,

Foremost of the many functions of this new board will be
the coordination of all university activities in regards to the
scheduling of events. All planned activities, including those
of Contact and the Dance Board, will be reported to the board
to prevent conflicts of events and to schedule activities evenly
throughout the school year.

This will indeed be a relief, particularly to those students
and faculty members who remember the 21-day marathon in
which Black Culture Week, Contact, and the Glasgow [n-
dowment Program brought a deluge of 15 major speakers and
events to this campus. As pointed out in this column earlier
this year, such a deluge was just too much for most students
and professors to contend with, and the three programs, each
exceptional in itself, lost some of their exceptional qualities by
virtue of their proximity to one another,

Hopefully, the four subcommittees under the Student Activi
ties Board—Film, University Center Building, Culture and
Recreation/Entertainment—will also aid in scheduling and im-
prove the student activities in general around campus.

If the restructuring is any indication, this campus can look
forward next year to some much needed changes thanks to
next year’s Executive Committee. Whether we are entering
the twentieth century or not can still be contested, but that
is not the point. The point is that we are not remaining static
and that we hopefully are not changing only for the sake
of change. We hope this move of the new EC foreshadows
further undertakings by the committee in the area of needed
change, for this university cannot continue to keep abreast
of other schools without such change.

A Little Fable

Once upon a time there was a sleepy little school in a sleepy
town ina beautiful and green valley with mountains all around.
The students at this school were like those anywhere else—
some slept all the time, some played, others walked around with
their noses buried in big thick books. During the spring there
seemed to be fewer and fewer with their noses in books; most
bought inner tubes and spent their Saturday afternoons float-
ing in big pools of beer or Southern Comfort.

Alas, it seemed for a long time that none of these boys could
become interested in anything but reading or floating all day
long. Until one day one got the bright idea of tying a net on
the end of a pole and tossing a ball with it. Soon everyone in
the little town was running up and down the football field,
waving their sticks, hitting each other with them, and having
a glorious time.

Then the WAHOOS came to town. No one knew what a
Wahoo was or where they came from, They carried sticks just
the same, tossed the ball quickly from one to the other—and
the people in the little town were sore afraid.

Then the people said, “Why don’t we leave our books and
our inner tubes and join together to beat back these Wahoos?”
And it was done. The books were tossed aside and the lovely
pools were drunk up dry—and everyone gathered to watch the
battle.

\t first it looked bad. In 90 seconds the Wahoos fiercely
threw their balls into the home ranks. Then a Skeeter gritted
his teeth and said, “The Wahoos aren't that tough.” And
sending their Teddy downfield, the people of the little valley
beat those Wahoos back into the hills.

It is said that the people of that sleepy little school will
never be the same again. Lookouts have been placed on all
the rivers, since rumors are spreading that a whole fleet of
stickmen will come sailing up to attack once more, Further
more, it is said that their captain will be shaking his fist for
revenge, since he used to be captain in the valley before he
learned to sail,

But the people in the little town are no longer afraid. They
have their Skeeter and their Teddy—so the only thing to fear
is fear itself. The End,

OUTLOOK andREVIEW! EC President Schwartz Speaks

On Coeducation, Other Issues

This is the second of two articles based
on a recent interview with second year
law student and student body president.
elect Doug Schwartz.—Ed.

at a ae

In an editorial appearing in the Phi be-
fore the run-off election, some of your
positions were questioned as simply cam-
paign rhetoric. How do you answer this
charge?

I remember the article real well, it ae-
cused me of campaign rhetoric and the
accusation that the EC was run by “Execu-
tive Fiat.” I think people remember that
right below it they had another editorial
concerning dis-enfranchisement of the co-
eds and their right to vote, and that since
they dis-enfranchised them that possibly
they are not governed by the honor system.
The strange thing about that was, was
that that was my campaign issue and that
the Ring-tum Phi basically got that from
hearing about me raising hell about the

co-eds not being allowed to vote, and that
wus one of my prime examples of the EC
ruling by “Executive Fiat.” There was
no vote or discussion by the EC, Bob
Brennan just announced that co-eds would
not be allowed to vote. And I promised to
that specifically as an example of “Execu-
tive Fiat.” The Ring-tum Phi is accusing
me of campaign rhetoric in pointing out
that the EC ruled by “Executive Fiat,”
right after that then pointed out my ex-
ample without my name or without men-
tioning the parallel I used, and I think the
Phi unknowingly answered its own charge.

What do you propose to do to avoid rul-
ing by “Executive Fiat” next year?

What we want to do is have a column
each week in the Ring-tum Phi which will
contain the complete EC agenda for the
next week, listed in an order so that it
will allow those who are affected to readily
discern what will be discussed and when,
\s far as Executive Committee Reorganiza-
‘ion goes, we are already under way re-
organizing the University Center Commit-
tee, which has in the past just organized
activities taking place in the University
Center. Basically our reorganization is go-
ing to rename it the Student Activities
Committee, and it will be responsible for
activities all over campus. It will be under
the jurisdiction of the EC so that the EC
will be direetly responsible for bringing
activity to all the students and that way
EC funding will be more readily available
for these projects.

A major position in your campaign was
your stand favoring co-education, Do you
feel that the recent referendum on co-
education was significant?

1 think that it is undoubtly certain
that the referendum was extremely im-
portant and extremely telling. About 80%
of the student body voted, so I think that
it cannot be denied hat the majoriy of the
student sentiment favors co-education, There
is now a breakthrough; it is a psychological
breakthrough more than anything else, be-
cause students have for the first time gone
on record saying that we want co-educa-
tion. There will have to be another referen-

dum next year and it will have to win by
an even bigger margin.

What do you feel you can do to help
the implementation of co-education at W&L?

Work has to be started now, and there
is a Board of Trustees meeting in May,
and the positions and wishes of the stu-
dents will be made known and we'll see
how far we get there. In the interim what
I am trying to work on now is changing
the arbitrary ceiling on co-eds which is
set at 30. In the interim period between
now and co-education to reach W&L, if
in fact it ever does, there is no reason
to at least double the number of co-eds.
| think this is an effective idea because
the administration would have no objec-
tion to this, and it would be a very bene-
ficial transition period towards co-educa-
tion,

How do you answer those people who
point out that one can get co-education at
many schools throughout the country,
whereas W&L is unique in the fact that
it is unisex and therefore offers a viable
alternative?

The purpose of W&L is to give the best
education possible. It is not beneficial to
say that W&L has it this way and another
schoo] has it another way, and therefore
one can make a choice. What W&L should
be asking itself is what is the best way to
achieve the best possible education, and
if it can be shown that a co-ed school
gives the most complete education, then
for people to want W&L to remain unisex
is ridiculous.

A major problem at W&L appears to be
a lack of community, This point has been
underscored most recently in the apparent
rift between the law school and the under-
graduate school, What do you see as the
central problem causing this rift?

Before I take this question straight on
| would like to point out that I believe a
major eause of the lack of community on
campus is due to the lack of co-education.
People now, starting at the beginning of
the week look out to girls’ schools to fulfill
their needs off campus. They don’t look
into the campus to seek fulfillment in its
activities. I think that if we had women
on campus then the school itself could be-
come the center of activity, and would thus
focus attention directly on the W&L com-
munity.

As for the rift with the law school and
the undergraduate school, there are as |
see, two basic problems. First of all, there
is a great age and interest difference be-
tween the schools. Beause of this there is
obviously going to be some _ separation.
rhis separation has been exacerbated by the
fact that the law school has often been
cut off from effective representation by
the undergraduate school.

For example, in the last co-education
referendum the EC voted on a motion not
to allow law students to vote. The argu-
ment was that only those people directly
affected by co-education should vote on
co-education. This argument is totally fal-
acious, because using their own argument

 

LETTERS TO TH

won seven,

Phi two issues after
ior wu to get this one

they would immediately emminate present
undergraduate seniors from voting because
they will not be sitting in the classroom
when co-education goes into effect.

The main point is that everyone is affect-
ed if the W&L environment is changed by
co-education, so everyone should be allowed
to vote on it. The law school firmly believes
that everybody has something to gain by
a sharing of educational facilities and in-
tellectual stimulation and knowledge, All
the law school wants is full representation
which it is now getting, and financial
equity, which it will get. The law school
does not want to fund activities which it
has nothing to do with, such as the Uni-
versity Grain Parties, Ariel, Calyx, and the
Phi, which it has nothing to do with. They
do not want autonomy, just financial and
representational equity. | believe that these
two areas are being resolved already,

What is your opinion of the tension be-
tween W&L and the Lexington community?
What are the major causes of this tension
and can anything be done about it?

| guess every college surrounding a com
munity has its “town and gown” hostili-
ties, and Lexington is no exception. I do
feel that the town has directed a few
actions against the student body, such as
the restaurant tax. The one that I will
specifically talk about is the licensing and
registration, in the form of Lexington city
and Rockbridge county tags, which are
necessary for your car,

There is a definite problem here. Many
students tried to register to vote in Lex-
ington in the last election. Almost every-
one was refused because they were deemed
not resident for voting purposes, At the
same time these students are taxed as resi-
dents of Rockbridge County and Lexington
in the form of county and city tags. This
to me is the epitomy of taxation without
representation,

Furthermore, there is a Virginia statute
on the county tag issue which specifically
states that if you are a non-resident using
your car solely for the purpose of trans-
portation and personal pleasure, you are
not required to purchase a county or city
tag. The judge here says that a city ordi-
nance says that if you live here nine months
out of the year, you are deemed a resident
of the city of Lexington. Of course they
neglected this when people tried to vote,
The judge also made the crazy statement
that the city ordinance overrules and super-
cedes state law. This is just bunk.

What we are trying to do now is that we
are going to have a number of under-
graduates and law students go before the
EC to ask for $500 to bring an appeal be
fore the circuit court and eventually the
State Supreme Court. | hope the EC does
fund this projeet because legally the stu-
dents are clearly right, and there are
hundreds affected by this. If they can prove
that they are legal out of state residents
only using their cars for transportation
and personal pleasure, they should not be
required to purchase county and city tags
(Note, the EC has funded the project, and
the appeal is currently being carried out

ied.)

Tennis Closes 16-7,
Captures CAC Title

The team played several teams
outside of their league which ac-
counted for most of their losses.
The Generals fell to Virginia,
Navy, Davidson, Harvard, and
VPI. The VPI match was a close
one in which the team perform-
ed well and went down in a 5-4
decision,

The VCAA tournament in Har-
risonburg, the weekend of April
27, was a resounding victory for
the Generals. In the nine division
competition, the W&L men took
seven divisions, The singles play
saw the team clean up by win-
ning at positions 1, 2, 4, 5, and
6, Junior Sandy Lawrence suc-
ceeded in capturing number one
singles in spite of a weak ankle

he had sprained the previous
week,

In fact, Lawrence was named
the best singles player at the

VCAA, Sophomore John Embree
won his match at position 2,
singles, Juniors Tim Thompson
and Warren Davis captured posi-
tions four and five respectively,
Captain Marshall Washburn took
the 5 spot for the Generals leav-
ing us with only one loss after
the singles.

The Blue kept up the pace in
the doubles by outscoring their
opponents in two of the three
divisions. John Embree and Tim
Thompson paired off to bring
Wé&L another win at the number
two position. Senior Steve Swen-
son and freshman Don Caffery
added a win to the team standing
by their play at number three
doubles.

The regional schools participat-
ing in the VCAA did not offer as
much competition for the Blue as
was expected. Hamden-Sydney
placed second in the tournament
action in Harrisonburg. Other
schools represented were Madison
College, Roanoke College, Emory
and Henry College, Bridgewater
College, and Lynchburg College.
W&L took the tournament with
65 points as compared with Hamp-
den-Sydney’s 36 points.

CAC Tournament

Last weekend the Generals won
the CAC tournament here by de-
feating Southwestern, Centre Col-
lege, and Sewanee College. It was
a round-robin tournament’ in
which W&L faced each of the
opponents in all nine divisions.
The Blue came into the tourna-
ment as defending champion.
The real contest was expected to
be between the Generals and
Sewanee,

Friday morning, May 11, saw
WE&L meet Centre College. John
Embree and Marshall Washburn
were our only winners in six
singles divisions, After singles
play Centre led the home team,
1-2. This meant that to win against
Centre we had to take all the
doubles matches,

The Big Blue pulled through in
doubles play and the final was
Wé&L’'s win, 54, The victorious
doubles pairs were Sandy Lawr-
ence and John Embree, Will
Paulfrey and Don Caffery, and

Diamond Bid Falls Short

By TOM RAMEY

They say that close is only
good in horseshoes and hand
grenades. The Washington and

Lee Baseball Generals were oh,
so close in 1973, but yet so far
away. For all practical purposes,
the ended this past Fri-
day when, in the seventh inning,
a bouncer to centerfielder Ellie
Gutshall hit a pebble only to
bound over his head all the way
to the centerfield fence. The
result was a 6-5 victory by Centre
over W&L.

Despite the fact that the Gen-
erals bounced back to defeat both
Sewanee and Southwestern to
take second place in the CAC
tourney, any aspirations for the
post-season NCAA playoffs slith-
ered away in the fateful seventh
inning of the Centre game. Dis-
couraged by the second place
finish, the Generals dropped a
game to Apprentice the following
day to end the season at 9-11.
“It was just one of those things,
something you cannot explain,”
remarked Coach Lyles in refer-
ence to the Centre game. “We
did not get the NCAA bid, yet I
was really proud of the boys to
bounce back as they did.”

The season was a disappoint-
ing one to the Generals, especi-
ally when one considers the pos-
sibilities that no doubt existed.
In reference to the season, Coach
Lyles said, “We could easily have
had and should have had a 15-5

Swenson and Stan Taylor
That afternoon the Generals
met Sewanee in what was to be
their closest match, The team was
somewhat concerned due to the
closeness of the match with
Centre which had been tougher
than expected, W&L ended up
in capturing the decision, 7-2.
Our two losses came in singles at
positions three and four.

Steve

After the singles we were ahead
1-2 but widened the gap by tak-
ing all three doubles matches.
The Generals doubles teams play-
ed well throughout the tourna-
ment and were undefeatd.

On Saturday morning we faced
Southwestern and won resound-
ingly, 8-1. The only loss came at

number one position, singles,
where Sandy Lawrence fell to an
Opponent who was named the

best singles player of the tourna-
ment. Senior Marshall Washburn
came through the weekend un-
scathed at the number five posi-
tion for the second year in a row.

Steve Swenson and Stan Taylor
won their second CAC title for
doubles play. John Embree also
emerged sucessfully by being un-
defeated in the number two posi-
tion in singles in CAC action.

The team had a fine year over-
all, No player had a losing record
for the season, The team should
enjoy another good year in ’74,
since six members of the nine
man squad will be returning let-
termen.,

Bogart Returns
Here Tonight

Humphrey Bogart returns to
W&L tonight in his last screen
performance, the 1956 “The
Harder They Fall,” presented by
the W&L Film Committee.

Based on the novel by writer
Budd Schulberg (‘What Makes
Sammy Run?” and “On the Water-
front’), the film is an expose of
corruption in the in the fight
business in the  not-too-distant
past,

Iix-sports writer Bogie and
crooked fight promoter Rod
Steiger lock horns in this one
as they push a South American
boxer (Max Baer) to the top in
a succession fixed fights.

The climactic match between
the out-for-blood champion and
the would-be champ Baer re-
mains one of the most brutal,
powerful indictments of the fight
game put on film.

The director, Mark Robson, is
also known for the classic box-
ing movie “Champion.”

The W&L Film Committee
wraps up its 1972-73 season next
week with Arthur Penn's first
film, “The Left-Handed Gun,’
which stars Paul Newman as
Billy the Kid in “one of the most
bizarre Westerns ever.”

But the 0 and 0 (for goals and
