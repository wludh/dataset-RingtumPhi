UC Petitions, Nominations

For The Gilliam Award Due

The

Executive Committee an-
nounced Monday that petitions
for the University Council are

due April 30 at 6 p.m. Elections
of new members for next year’s
UC will follow a week later. Four
positions are open for rising
seniors, three for rising juniors,
and two for rising sophomores.

Fifty signatures are needed on
the petition.
Candidates for the Frank J.

Gilliam Award must be nominat-
ed by next Monday. Any member
of the student body or faculty
may nominate a senior from the
undergraduate or law school. The

five accepted their invitation, Al}

cruitment Weekend were black.
Th Recruitment Committee felt
that its efforts had been success-
ful four of these five con-
firmed their acceptance as a re-

trips taken to grants to
the university for scholarships.
To date these have proved suc-

OUTLOOK AND REVIEW

Should Degrees Be Withheld?

As is the case whenever students find themselves in conflict
with the law, the November arrests of eight Washington and
Lee men on drug charges is still having its reprecussions
for everyone involved. The long-drawn legal proceedings are
trying not only for the students but for their friends and
families as well. Since that first evening spent in the Rock-
bridge jail, the students have received all kinds of unwanted
publicity, and, furthermore, must still wait to find out how
those arrests will affect each of their future lives.

Moreover, the drug bust has created dilemmas for others,
besides those directly involved. Paramount for the University
is the problem of disciplinary action. What should the Uni-
versity—administration or Student Control Committee—do
with regard to the indicted students? Should some University
action be taken or should the cases be simply ignored?

These are very real and difficult questions, one which have
plagued students and administrators alike for months since
the initial arrests. A strong case can be made for the tradi-
tional need to maintain university disciplinary sanctions: for
one, our Honor System specifically states that there are no
limits—geographical or substantive—to its proper enforce-
ment. A W&L student has always been held responsible for
his behavior at any place and under any circumstances as long
as he is representing himself as a member of the W&L stu-
dent body. Secondly, many members of the faculty feel (and
legitimately so) that a degree from Washington and Lee
must be protected from any kind of debasement—or, in other
words, that the power to withhold degrees from students
under judicial indictment should be retained.

So then, should the students in the present situation,
many of whom will not have had their trials before their
scheduled graduation day, be denied their degrees pending
review after their legal procedings are rsolved? Should they
be placed in a kind of “double jeopardy” by the university
at all? The answers to these questions, at this point, have
yet to be found.

For one thing, there is little or no precedent for a dilemma
of this nature, Oh, a few years back one student pilfered a
carpet from a Lexington merchant and, more recently, another
played Jesse James by holding up a local gas station, But
these students saved university officials from grappling with
the discipline issue by vountarily withdrawing from W&L
and heading for the hills.

In addition, drug cases are entirely different in that the
laws allegedly violated and the undercover operation itself
are so immensely unpopular. Many students are so familiar
with the very drugs cited in the counts that they are sym-
pathetic toward the few that get caught and accused of deal-
ing wih them, Furthermore, nearly everyone concedes that the
penalities for such crimes are much too harsh.

So any felony conviction involving drugs—be it just or
not—is going to have a different character, in the minds of
most students, than a different sort of serious crime. The
members of the Administration know that. So do the mem-
bers of the Student Control Committee. And they realize that
they would be immediately cast as the villians of the hour
were severe university action taken against the students pres-
ently embroiled in the courts.

We suspect that, in the present situation, university action
will be passed by. And perhaps that is the most fair and most
realistic resolution to the question, considering the current

climate. No university inquiry could be made, of course, be-
fore a student’s trial in the courts, for fear of prejudicing his
case there. And to withhold the students’ degrees, at this
juncture, would only compound the discomfort and embarrass-

ment of this whole episode.

A resolution was introduced at the last faculty meeting
which would provide for withholding of degrees from students
when disciplinary actions were not complete. The resolution,
now under study, would not go into effect until 1974 and,
therefore, would not concern those indicted in November.
The faculty should be extremely careful in consideration of
these proposals, but some provision must be made so that
the University’s disciplinary posture will be clear should such
a situation ever arise again. —N.E.P.

On The State Of The Phi

Whether the Ring-tum Phi is to be abolished after this
term is a decision to be made by the Publications Board on
May 8. Until then, we of the Phi can only try to secure the
paper's existence as an integral part of this campus by taking
steps to justify the paper’s existence and to adapt the paper
more to the needs of the students.

Last week's questionnaire on the Phi (see story on page
one) was a major step towards our self-evaluation, as it were.
Major trends seen in the results of the questionnaire do seem
to give us at least some idea of what the W&L student body
thinks about the Phi,

The poll revealed that most students, in reading the paper
weekly, turn to the Phi for its news and its letters to the
editor. This seems to indicate importance of the paper to the
students if only as an information sheet and a forum for
the airing of student wrath. Indeed, the vast majority of
students filling out the questionnaire recognized the need of
a publication such as the Phi for information and for use as
a forum, as well as for entertainment.

The poll also showed that students would generally like
to see more columns and greater news coverage in the Phi.
And they also indicated they would like to see the quality of
writing in the paper improve. In fact, the lack of quality writ-
ing was the major complaint of the students.

But to fulfill these wishes of the students, the Ring-tum
Phi needs more than just the same four or five people doing
most of the work on the paper every week, And it is here
where most of the problems of the Phi lie—not enough stu-
dents are interested. Our news coverage can't be complete
unless we have reporters to cover all the news. We can't
improve the quality of the writing if some writers get stuck
writing three or four stories every week, and if the editors
are too busy writing the copy instead of editing it for quality.

The point is that the future of the Phi rest with the W&L
student body. No paper can be published unless there is a
staff to put it together, And no good paper can be published
unless there is a good staff to work on it.

Tonight's organizational meeting of the Ring-tum Phi will
be a crucial step in determining the fate of the paper. If no
student interest is expressed, the Phi will probably cease to
exist after May 8, But a sincere showing of student interest
will be a positive step towards salvaging the Phi and re-
building it to better serve the needs of W&L students. But
the choice is up to those same students.

A History Of The Cockpit

In Its Former Grandeur

By J. JASON HATTHEWS
and DAVE FINNELL |

« .. And just remember this, a
kiss is but a kiss, a smile is but
a smile...” The smoke, the white
piano, the red carnations all melt
into a chalky but pleasant scene.
The piano player is asked to play
it again, and the long silver gowns
of the women rustle between
songs. Where are we? Casablanca?
Cafe de la Paix? The Stork Club?
No, we are at the Cockpit, its
deluxe red-velour wallpapered
walls shimmer in the mysterious
glow of the gas-light lanterns.

This exotic gathering spot has
offered many hours of relaxation
and enjoyment to DUBYANEL
and Lexington residents alike, But
what of its origins? What of
the stories that are told to open-
mouthed freshmen about the
countless intrigues that have
raged on its svelte wooden dance
floor?

The Cockpit, constructed some-
where at the turn of the Winter
Term by popular and_ interna-
tionally famous  restauranteur
Dean Weaver of Rockbridge
Baths, was at first, staunchly
opposed by everyone in the Lex-
ington community. The governing
fathers believed that the new
‘dinner-club’ would naturally
draw ‘bad blood’ from the big
syndicate strongholds of Stuarts
Draft and Chicago.

Disregarding their warnings,
Weaver, (nicknamed “shotglass”
by close friends because he al-
ways wore a small crystal measur-
ing cup on his head, delighting
his guests as he made the rounds
of the tables at the club), went
ahead with the painstaking con-
struction, Ultimate control of the
liquor and numbers percentages
was decided quickly after open-
ing night when power bids by
Cosa Nostra thugs from Chicago
and Kansas City were squelched
by the Galax and Troutville 4-H
strongarm torpedoes,

During Prohibition, the Cock-
pit held the somewhat infamous
distinction as the main distribu-
tion point of Dr. Pepper and
Pam Vegetable Spray in the whole
Shenandoah Valley.

Later, the Cockpit further broke
restaurant tradition with the ex-
citing floor-shows that drew
people away from the rival club
at Natural Bridge. This advant-
age was taken away by the un-
timely and as yet unexplained
death of the top-billed “Monty
the Singing Collie” and the sub-
sequent disappearance, (many be-
lieve phone threats scared him
into fleeing), of hilarious ‘second
banana’ Jerry Sugar, the only al-
bino midget giraffe to perform on
the stage.

The years of competition be-
tween the Cockpit and the
“Drama of Creation Lounge” at
Natural Bridge were many and
certainly stormy. One particular
favorite story was the time when
Weaver, then old and losing con-
trol of his club, opened one day
to find his entire restaurant litter-
ed with a grisly cargo. On the
tables, the walls, draped over the
chandeliers were dead roosters,
their blood was every where.Feath-
ers added to the mess, and be-
tween sneezes the grizzled
Weaver muttered through clench-
ed teeth, “Get the boys, we're
going to pay Natural Bridge a
little visit.”

The story differs from here,
but it is generally agreed that
Weaver's ‘touch men’ threw burn-
ing paper bags filled with manure
into the plush “Drama of Crea-
tion Lounge.” The opposition’s
burly bouncers rushed to stomp

out the flaming objects. Several
weeks later, the boys from Na-
tural Bridge had packed up and
were gone forever. However, the
damage had been done and the
name Cockpit stuck.

With Weaver's eventual death,
a quick, fierce struggle for con-
trolling interest ensued. The
lucrative Bonomo Turkish Taffy
franchise was at stake at the time,
and many thought that to control
the Cockpit was to control the
Turkish Taffy pie. After the dust
cleared, the celebrated vamp and
owner of the failing dancing-din-
ing Hedgepeths Club, Prissy
Crooner, took over and for years
the Cockpit basked under her
wise and thrifty hand.

She instituted the no-nonsense
practice of seperating the men
from the women in segregated
‘uni-sex’ booths, and with the in-
creased power due to her appoint-
ment as head of the pin-boy
union at the bowling alleys, she
was able to effect a ‘check be-
hing the ears’ policy before ad-
mitting any guest.

It was during this ear of the
Cockpit that the infamous Travel-
ler Seance Hoax rocked the lives
of everyone in the area, Miss
Crooner sponsored the seance
which was conducted by the lynx-
eyed medium from New Market,
Madame Lobotome. The room was
filled with guests from around
the area and after many incanta-
tions and much groaning contact
was made with Traveller, the fam-
ous war-horse of Gen. Robert FE.
Lee.

The inventive steed tapped the
answers to many questions in a
concise and oft-times witty fash-
ion with his hooves. Yes, he was
happy ‘over there’ in the big
paddock in the sky, yes, the
‘massa’ still prized his after-din-
ner ride, and no, the General's
socks were not still falling down
into his boots. Of Washington and
Lee itself, Traveller spoke warm-
Iv, but grew despondent when
he was questioned about his long
stay in the basement of the chapel
as a ‘stuffed exhibit.” The whole
affair degenerated rapidly though,

when from beneath her billow-
ing skirts, Madame Lobotome
dropped to the floor a pair of
coconut shells that hed been
strapped to the inside of her

knees.

Today the Cockpit provides the
members of the community with
a heady combination of urbane
conversation and sophisticated
yet racy fun. An_ Impressive
menu awaits to surprise the pal-
ate, while the nostalgic tunes
that waft from the juke-box carry
the happy diners down memory
lane. Many sav the charm and
elegance of the place has passed
into oblivion with its colorful
owners,

True, the owners are gone, but
the charm still resides in the
dark polished gleam of the wood-
en walls, in the traditional over-
stuffed red table chairs, in the
service and the impeccable cater-
ing given to each and every guat.
As in all things, the rising costs
have made it impossible for the
Cockpit to offer the deluxe “Old
World” services that were once
taken for granted. But let the
diners and seekers of good fun
go there for the sheer enjoyment
of sitting where the most wonder-
ful Mr. Weaver once lounged, or
where, en route from Richmond
to a hunting fete in Kentucky,
Seott Fitzgerald and Zelda came
for a quick drink and to get
sick in the nearby washroom
Gom these days, but
memory of them still lives,

Square dancing, even in our
“back to basics” climate has not
completely overcome its country
bumpkin stigma. But the 50 or so

students and faculty members
who showed up at last Firday
night’s square dance, held beside

the ROTC building, were largely
unaware that they were enjoying
what, four years ago, they would
have ridiculed as “corny.”
Actually, square dancing is only
one more bucolic institution that
this denim clad generation has
borrowed from the “hill people.”
The country-style informality that
spawned square dancing compli-
ments the post-Woodstock counter
culture. It is not suprising that

Both types of musical events
offer an arena for disposing of
inhibitions (through music and
other stimulants). And both are
in sharp constrast to the “but-

toned down” life styles and en-

sixties.

No doubt, many of the dancers
and bystanders, last Friday night,

were attracted not by the danc-
