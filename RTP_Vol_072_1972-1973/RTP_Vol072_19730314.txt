Mills Godwin: Search
For A New Coalition

By BRYAN HATCHETT

When Mills Godwin ran success-
fully for Governor of Virginia in
1965, he was in the unique position
of having the blessing of state De-
mocratic leader, Sen. Harry Byrd
Sr., newly enfranchised Blacks (fol-
lowing the repeal of the poll tax)
and organized labor. It was called
the Godwin coalition.

In 1973, the machine that Sen.
Byrd controlled is no longer in
power—if it indeed exists as a co-
and his sole opponent,
Henry Howell, will
around labor

hesive force—
so far, Lt. Gov,
build his candidacy
and Black support.

“| don't think | have changed at
all. | think my party changed,”
Godwin said last night in an inter-
view following his speech to the
Lexington Chamber of Commerce,
He was guest of honor at a banquet
in Evans Dining Hall last night. The
life long Democrat still refers to his
former party with the personal pro-
noun “my,” which may reflect a cer-
tain uneasiness about his recent re-
nouncialion

“At the moment, I am technically
an Independent because | have not
been offered the Republican nomina-

tion, T am not seeking the Repubii-
can nomination, but | will accept

As in the ‘65 race, Godwin is

faced with the problem of bringing
divergent elements behind a single
candidate, Bul, for the same candi

date, who participated in “massive
resistance” in the late 50's and re-
ceived Black support in the 65 gub-
ernatorial race, surely, the fusion of
Republicans and conservative Demo-
crats is not beyond the realm of pos-
sibilities.

His strategy, at this point at least,
apparently is to avoid saying any-
thing that could offend either fac-
tion, His speech, last night, was void
of specific proposals or campaign
promises. Instead, he spoke in gen-
eralities with the paternalistic man-
ner and aristocratic dignity so com-
mon to Virginia governors.

Succumbing to the temptation,
equally characteristic of Virginia
governors, to play up the “heritage”
of the office, Godwin referred to an-
other former governor, Thomas Jef-
ferson. Such a reference is seldom
unappreciated by Chambers of Com-
merce anywhere in the Common-
wealth. And when it is included with
a commendation of President Nix-
on's recent policy statement on law
and order, then all political bases
are covered,

Like Nixon, who he vigorously
supported last November, Godwin
favors the death penalty in some in-

stances. Later, when asked if he
shares Nixon's contempt for “soft
headed judges,” Godwin replied,

“We have an excellent judiciary in
Virginia.”
He again sidesiepped a contro

DOUGLAS SCHWARTZ

Powell, Schwartz Battle
‘In Presidential Contest

By PAUL LANCASTER

Junior Lewis Powell will face in-
termediate law student Doug Sch-
wartz Thursday in a runoff election
for president of the W&L student
body.

Powell and Schwartz amassed the
most votes of the four candidates
running for the office in Monday's
general elections. Schwartz missed
a majority of the vote—and a vic-
tory in the election—by under five
votes, totalling 634 of the 1273
votes cast for president. Powell re-
ceived 487 votes. Averill Harkey re-
ceived 98 votes and Harry Smith 42.
There were 12 write-ins.

Proposals Made To Close
Undergraduate, Law Gap

An ad hoe committee of the Exe-
cutive Committee Monday present-
ed a report on the relationship be-
tween the law school and the un-
dergraduate student body. Among
recommendations made by the com-
mittee was one to redistribute fi-
nances of the student government
to give “equitable treatment” to the
law students.

The committee recommended that
the tax on each law student not be
given to several activities which all
students now pay for through the
tax, These activities are the Film
Committee, Ariel, and Calyx. Jeff
Twardy, who along with Henry
Jernigan is co-chairman of the ad
hoc committee, said that this pro-
posal seemed reasonable since the
law students do not really benefit
from any of those activities, Also
indicated in the recommendation
was a decrease in the amount of
each law student's tax going to the
Ring-tum Phi. The
be reduced by over

amount would
two dollars to

Applications are now being ac-
cepted by the Publications Board
for all editorial and business
managerial positions on all of
Washington and Lee's 1973 pub-
lications. Elections will take
place Sunday, March 25, at the
Alumni House at 7 p.m

Positions available to any
member of the student body are
as follows: Editor of the Ring-
tum Phi, Editor of the Calyx,
Business Manager of the Ring-
ium Phi, Business Manager of
the Calyx, and Editor of the
Ariel.

Applicants for any one of these
five positions should plan to ap-
pear in person before the Pub-
lications Board. Applications
should be given to the Presiden
President Bob Wilson or Secre-
tary Drew Staniar. Applications
should include:

a brief letter of

 

intent stating

one dollar per law student.

l'wardy indicated, however, that
part of the law student tax would
still go to university activities which
benefited the law students. Included
in this list were the student body re-
serve fund, the EC's administrative
fund, Contact, and the Publications
Board.

The remainder of the law stu-
dent's tax not going to these would
be allocated to law school functions,
including the Student Bar Associa-
tion, the Law School News, and the
law school's speaker program.

The report mentioned that, at the
presem, the law school’s portion of
the total student tax was $4300, and
only $2100 was allotted to law acti-
vities this year.

The commitiee was formed last
fall to investigate what many saw as
a widening schism between the law
school and the undergraduate school.
Two prime functions of the commit-
tee were to find fundamental causes
of the schism and to recommend

possible actions which could be
taken to alleviate the situation.

The committee's five-page report
cited three primary causes of the
rift between the two schools, The
difference in age between students
of both schools and the fact that
most law students are married tend-
ed to “remove (these students) from
the University community,” accord-
ing to the report.

The report also cited “the number
of law-related, professionalized acti-
vities” of law students as a cause of
the rift. Anticipation of the law
school’s future move into Lewis
Hall, farther away from the heart of
the campus than is Tucker Hall, was
also listed as a cause.

The report also listed several “re-
medial recommendations” to im-
prove communications between the
two schools, Twardy indicated that
efforts are already being made to
revise the freshman law orientation
to emphasize all phases of commun-
ity life, undergraduate and law. He
suggested that the move be recipro-
cated in regard to undergraduate
freshman orientation, to give these
students a grasp of activties in the
law school.

According to Twardy, efforts are
already being made to set up bullet-
in boards of undergraduate activities
in Tucker Hall and of law student
activities near the Co-op to help im-
prove communications

The report also recommended
that no fundamental changes in the
administration of the Honor System
be made at this time. Discussion of
such a topic would be more appro-
priate at a later time, the report in-
dicated, such as after the move to
Lewis Hall.

Discussion of the report was tabl-
ed at Monday's EC meeting until
next Monday, so that all EC mem-
bers would have time to study the
report and the recommendations
therein

The Run-Off

difficult decisions will no doubt be made before students cast

their votes in the therefore,

final Presidential contest; we,
offer a review of the functions of the Student Body Presi-
dnt. Briefly stated, they are as follows:

(1) As representative of the student body at large, he
should support student opinion and be willing to adapt to
changes in it.

(2) As head of the Executive Committee and its subcom-
mittees, he should have grasp the governmental
structure of the university.

(3) As executive of the Honor System, he directs Honor

trials and is expected to carry out the Honor System fully.
(4) As student

he must be able to articulate student sentiment to the Board

representative to the Board Trustees,
in an effective manner.

(5) Likewise, he is the chief bridge between students and
the faculty and administration.
The campaign, up to this point, has presented two candi-
dates who could not be more different—in style, temperament,
and platforms. When we endorsed the coeducation proposal
in these columns last week, we had no idea that Doug Sch-
wartz would be able to catalyze such a gratifying result in
student opinion.
We do detect,
in the feverish atmosphere of this campaign, a genuine stu-

about their choice. The outcome will surely affect more than
the sexual makeup of the student body—but the Honor Sys-

Students Treated ‘Fairly?

 

University Faces Drug Problem

By JESS REEVES

The present academic year once
again brings to light the existance of
drugs on campus and in the Wash-
ington and Lee community. This
fact certainly comes as no surprise,
but it does present the question as
to how the university is to react to
this situation. The most recent in-
fraciton of the school’s ban on drugs
in its domitories seems to show that
the university is doing its best to
handle the problem fairly.

Several weeks ago seven fresh-
men found to be in possession of
marijuana by their dormitory coun-
selors, Their case first came before
the Student Control Committee
which is comprised solely of stu-

dents, The SCC heard the case and
recommended the usual penalty for
the freshmen: one month donmitory
probation and conduct probation.
Usually a letter is sent home to the
students parents informing them of
the situation.

The Student Affairs Committee
reviewed the decision of the SCC
and modified its disciplinary action.
Finally the students were allowed to
return to their rooms between mid-
night and eight a.m. The SAC de-
cided that no letters would be sent
home to the parents of the students
involved, and they would still be on
conduct probation.

The final decision
was formed in

of the SAC
response to the

Ma dai

opinions of the — students  ac-
cused, iene to them, the in-
forming of their parents was one of
the very severest penalties that could
have been imposed. The SAC, in an
effort to be flexible, therefore did
not impose this penalty. But what if
a parent called his child during his
month of absence from the dormi-
tory? The possibility of this hap-
pening made it necessary for the
students to be allowed some limited
access to their dormitories, thus the
12-8 stipulation.

In spite of the SAC’s attempt to
be fair, the criticism might be made
that even the penalties doled out are
too severe. After all, the Com-
monwealth of Virginia considers the
possession of marijuana a misde-
meanor thereby placing it in the
same category with possession of
alcohol by minors. Washingon and
Lee does not attempt to keep
alcohol, or drunks, out of the dormi-
tories so why is marijuana viewed
differently.

According to Dean Noell, who sits
on the SAC, the university's policy
toward drugs on campus is the re-
sult of outside influences. In the
first place, parents and society in
general find drinking much more
acceptable than using drugs. The
school must also protect itself from
the interference of city authorities.
Ihe presence of alcohol in the dor-
mitories will probably not result in
a raid by the local authorities but a
drug bust is entirely possible. The
police are less likely to conduct a
bust on campus if they feel the uni-
versity is trying to keep its own
backyard clean.

The university faces a somewhat
different situation concerning the stu-
dents involved in the November
bust. The issue is what action should
the university take now that the

trials have been pushed back to
May and June? Bill Cole, Chairman
of the SCC, feels that no concrete
action will be taken before the trials
unless the cases are simply reviewed
upon demand,

Dean John feels that university
action concerning those indicted
would be a problem if taken before
the trials. He sees the dilemma as
twofold: the university does not
want to prejudge the students’ cases
and obtaining evidence while the
cases are still pending in court would
be difficult. Perhaps the university
could withhold degrees from these
students until their cases were out
of court but Dean John realizes how
unpopular this action would be.

Dean John went on to say that
the flexibility of the university's
position on the drug cases is shown
by the fact that intelligent distinc-
tions can be made in handing out
punishment depending upon the
gravity of the offense. A difference
should be established between a stu-
dent cajoled by an undercover agent
to sell drugs at little or no profit
and the student dealing with exten-
sive traffic.

The attitude taken by Washing-
ton and Lee toward drugs is the re-
sult of a desire to protect its stu-
dent body as much as anything else.
Federal and local authorities are
concerned only with the disciplin-
ary aspect of the problem, not the
counselling aspect. In its decisions
this year the school has shown a re-
sponsiveness to student opinion on
the subject and a desire to deal with
the situation fairly, Those involved
in this year’s on campus drug cases
should be glad that the school is
playing big brother and not shun-
ning its responsibilities to the less
benevolent authorities from the out-
side world.

Letters To The Editor

Another on Coeducation

lo the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

At this writing (Monday noon)
it's not known what result will come
of the student referendum on co-
education at W&L. The comments
that follow bear, then, far less on
today’s vote—however that may go
—than on the merits of the question
itself,

"Not that I mind you dogs running wild all over campus, But, when you
start auditing my class and barking at my lectures, then out you go!”

Your editorial of last week pre-
sented an attempt to review both
sides of the issue, although it failed
to state the opinion of coeducation’s
opponents here that bringing full-
time coeds to the school would ir-
ritate alumni, perhaps diminishing
their generosity hence-forth, and
would eventually produce “alum-
nae” who are proverbially less than
munificent in their own donations
to an alma mater. You then con-
cluded, as a matter of proclama-
tion rather than of argument, that
coeducation “would best serve the
future of W&L as an_ institution.”
Readers must have wondered how
such a judgment was formed.

Worse, though, is the annoying
reflection that proponents of co-
education have never made a sefi-
ous case for their cause. Those of
us who wish to see them lose this
fight can only suspect that faculty
advocates of the change simply wish
to climb on any bandwagon of fad-
dism and “progress” and that stu-
dent supporters of coeducation are
less interested in “humanity” and
“friendship” (as they claim) than in
cutting down on time-consumimeg
road trips.

Assuredly intellectual and scho-
larly considerations can't have cross-
ed the mind of any defender of co-
education, Your own hope that “the
admittance of a few hundred wom-
en. might just give W&L a shot
of vitality it so desperately needs”
will be dispelled by ten minutes of
conversation with a college-age girl,
pick the one you will, The single
claim to distinction which such a

W&L Faculty In The Early 1900's

By J. JASON MATTHEWS

Last week, my silver crucifix came
back from the cleaners and feeling
safe, | descended into the archives
of the library to browse around.
Way in the corner, veiled by eons of
dust and cobwebs, was a crumbling
leather bound volume which kept
me entranced for hours, In fact, I
almost stayed down there after sun-
set, and you know how foolhardy
that is! The faded gold leaf print
was barely visible in the dim light
and | shuddered when I finally de-
ciphered the title . . . “Washington
and Lee Faculty 1897-1933,”
What a gold mine!

| surrepticiously slipped the vol-
ume under my coat, and with little
thought of Robert E. Lee’s honor-
able nature, scurried out the back
door of the Library. | spent a whole
evening going ever that enchanting
tome and have compiled a small list
of the most fascinating faculty mem-
bers. If there is any doubt as to
why we, modern-day DUBYANEL
students bask in the academic uto-
pia of 1972, then look at the price-
less heritage we have acquired from
these venerable pedagogues.,

Astronomy

Dr. Earl B. MacKenzie, 1924-

1931, Dr. McKenzie, a graduate of
the Rocky Mount Institute of the
Stars was on “semi-permanent”

loan from the Rocky Mount Cham-
ber of Commerce. His photograph
shows him to be a large, strong-
browed man with an inner power
emenating from steely, although
crossed eyes. Dr. MacKenzie was
never taken seriously by his stu-
dents as he viewed the heavens us-
ing the tube of a toilet paper roll.
His mysterious disappearance in
1931 was made even more puzzling
by a note in the doctor’s own hand,
left on his bureau saying, “The Mar-
tians have invited me to stay for a
week, so don't wait up.”

Chemistry

Dr. Phillip A. Holland, 1899-
1900. Dr. Holland's unusually short
stay at WAL was due to negligence
on the part of his advanced chemis-
try students. Carelessly leaving a
powerful acid on the floor of Dr.
Holland's office overnight, the stu-
dents were responsible for the rapid
descent of Dr. Holland, his typewri-
ter, and an expensive set of volumes
dealing with oxidation of Phenol in
Saline solution to the basement of

the science building the next morn-
ing. During his short stay however,
Dr .Holland did contribute to the
academic society’s welfare by un-
covering such impurities in the din-
ing hall food as iron filings and fly
ash, He is buried in the foundation
of Howe Hall,

Commerce

Dr. Lawrence T. Filagree, 1924-

1933. Dr, Filagree, a graduate of
Harvard business school came to
W&L with what may be called a

“chip” on his shoulder. Accused of
luring the Harvard Presiednt’s dog
Ruff, into his room to show the be-
wildered creature the uncut version
of “Ecstacy” with Hedy Lamaar, he
had barely enough time to get out
of town before the crowds appeared
in his foyer. Because of this unjust
treatment, Dr. Filagree enjoyed the
somewhat infamous reputation of
being the hardest “A” in the school.
A quiet and simple man, the good
doctor lived outside of Lexington,
his spacious two-story home over-
looking the scenic pastures of the
Shenandoah Valley.

English

Dr. Ernest P. Snaders, 1898-1927,
Dr. Snaders was without a doubt
the most popular and well-respected
professor on campus, The 1924 and
1926 yearbooks were dedicated to
him, and there wasn't a minute of
the day that Dr. Snaders wasn’t sur-
rounded by adoring students asking
questions or for advice in all sorts
of matters.

His pictures (the early ones), por-
tray him as a jovial and smiling
man, his twinkling eyes even now,
instilling us with a great warmth.
However, in 1927, his last year at
WA&L, something seems to have
happened. That year records noth-
ing special save for Dr. Snader’s
revision of the Honor Pledge, (mak-
ing it airtight and impossible to get
around).

But the year was marred by in-
credible near-accidents like payroll
teelering off buildings, nar-
missing Dr. Snaders, and the
demolishing of his brand-new
Model-T by explosion two minutes
before Dr. Snaders was to drive it
to the campus. He left Lexington
after the third fire burned his home,

est period of time. Called back to his
native France to serve on the Magi-
not Line, the first-line defense
against the mighty German advance,
Dr. Grenoille quickly remembered
a sick aunt in San Diego and was

Dr, lannis Skatopoulos, 1929-

opoulos is perhaps the most touch-
ing in all this list. On a cultural
junket to New York one weekend,
Dr. Skatopoulos had to be carried,
trembling, out of the production of
“Oedipus” and brought to a hospi-
tal. After several days rest, he re-
turned to Lexington but never taught
again. On the night of his arrival
back in Lexington, it is said that he
intentionally put his eyes out by
staring into the sun, and wandered

History

Dr. George Frederick, 1920-1927,
Dr. Frederick, the school’s only octe

genarian at the time of his retire
ment, was one of the University’s
most colorful characters. Although

indicted by some to have grown ad-
dled, the majority of the student
body were endeared to him by his
lovable habits of dating the Civil
War before the Mayflower, and
drooling on term papers. Always a
favorite because of his short classes,
the student often showed their ap-
preciation by genily carrying him
off the podium and depositing him
on the cot he had in his office, (that
being the only piece of furniture in
the room),

Basketb

  

By WARREN DAVIS

The prevailing attitude concern-
ing the °72-73 Generals basketball
season was definitely optimistic.
With four returning starters and a
talented crop of freshmen and sop-
homores, all indications pointed to-
ward a promising season, The opti-
mism soon faded, however, with the
Generals hovering around the 500
mark all season and, except in a few
games, failing to realize their poten-
tial. Senior Charlie Strain talked
with us about some of the seasons
for the disappointing year and of-
fered some opinions about the bas-
ketball program in general. Charlie,
a 61” guard, hails from Garden
City, New York, and has earned
three varsity letters at Washington
and Lee.

Oharlie offered a number of fac-
tors contributing to the team’s de-
mise, such as “inexperience after the
first four, since the rest of the team
was made up mostly of freshmen
and sophomores. Losing Norm
(Kristoff) definitely hurt, since we
lost needed board strength, plus the
fact that Paul (McClure) didn’t get
the chance to rest as much during
the games. We didn’t run as much
as we might have, although we had
ihe material to run and a lot of
times we didn’t put enough pressure
on the other team. Many times we
played the other team’s game in-
stead of playing the type of ball
which we were capable of playing.”
\ big problem that few people
think of is the three week layoff for
Christmas vacation. “It’s hard to
stay in shape for three weeks on
your own. You're bound to lose
something when you come back in
January, Overall, too, the quality of

competition was a little better this
year.”

One of the interesting things
Charlie pointed out was that there
might have been “a little too much
organization.” This may have taken
some of the fun out of the game.
“In New York, it’s a completely dif-
ferent style of ball. A lot of people
think of New York playground ball
as strictly one on one, but it’s really
not at all. It's more two on two and
three on three, with a lot of pick
and rolls, a lot of shooting off
screens, a lot of just taking advan-
tage of the situation. In New York,
the basketball is more creative and
the players rely much more on in-
stinct. Here, it’s pattern ball and
there’s not as much room for free
lancing. In a way it is inhibiting,
which results in a lack of confidence.
rhis year we didn't have the clutch
euy like Mike Daniel to go to in
tight situations, A lot of the play-
ers weren't confident to ‘make their
move’ which may come with more
experience. By playing pattern bas-
ketball each shot takes on more im-
portance. When you're running you
tend to be loose and it’s not as im-
portant if you miss a 15-footer off
a fast break because you usually
have guys crashing the boards.”

When asked if he did anything dif-
ferently this year, Charlie replied, “I
kept my mouth shut, | tried to do
the best | could when | got in a
game and tried to show leadership
from the bench—if that’s possible.”
As some will remember, Charlie
started the first eight games and
was then benched as Verne Canfield
tried different guard combinations to
try and get the team going. ¢ harlie

Netters Prepa re
For Big Spring

By PAUL SIMPSON

In a rare, exclusive interview with
Warren Davis, The Ring-tum Phi,
in a rare display of journalistic ag-
gressiveness, has gained invaluable
information concerning the condi-
tion of the 1973 Washington and
Lee tennis team.

Dr. Davis, who, after many re-
quests finally relented and allowed
his first exclusive interview to a
member of the Phi sport's staff, ex-
pressed his optimism for the com-

ing season in just a few concise
words, “I think we have good
depth,”

And how important “good depth”
is. With each separate tennis meet

consisting of six single and three
double matches, the sixth man

counts just as much as the first,
Losing only one man from last
year’s squad (Captain Jeff Driscoll),
the Generals of the courts appear
to be in a good position to retain

Diamond Nine Looking Real Fine;
Open Season This Saturday Here

By TOM RAMEY

Baseball at Washington and Lee
has for some time been a subject
valued only in the eyes of the be-
holders. For quite a while, the pro-
gram has been neglected, given only
a minimal budget, and taken for
granted. In response to this, W&L
baseball teams of late have been
rather sporadic, But such was not
the case last year as the ‘72 Gen-
erals, coming off a 5-20 record the
year before, had an NCAA Region
Three Playoff berth within their
grasp only to be snatched away al
the last moment by Old Dominion.

The 1973 rendition of Washing-
ton and Lee baseball opens this Sat-
urday to what Coach Joe Lyles op-
timistically predicts “could and
very likely will be the best baseball
team Washington and Lee has had
in the fourteen years that | have
been here.” There are perhaps sev-
ral reasons with which Coach Lyles
can justify his predictions. First of
all, being defending CAC champs,
the nucleus for a championship
team already exists. Despite blows
from graduation, seven lettermen
return to offer the experience and
leadership necessary for a winning
season.

Secondly, Lyles is “ex-
tremely pleased” with the ability
shown so far by the incoming fresh-
mon and by a trio of sophomores
who are out for the first time. lt is
this group that must be relied on if
the year is to be a successful one.
Thirdly, concerns this year’s co-cap-
tains: “Credit is due where credit is
deserved,” Coach Lyles commented
referring to Co-Captains Ellie Gut-
shall and Doug Clelan, Both have
already taken the initative by ex
h biting leadership and responsibil
ity, and other intangibles which are
essential to a sucessful year.

Coach

The team itself looks rather solid
throughout. That all important pitch-
ing staff is anchored down by hard
throwing sophomore “Hod Rod”
Ferrandino, who wound up last year
with a nifty 3.72 E.R.A. Expected
to bolster both the starting rotation
and the bullpen are lefty Haller
Jackson, co-captain Ellie Gutshall,
and freshmen Tom Hudgins and
Matt Basile. Yet the surprise of the
season so far has been sophomore
Jeff Knauer, who Lyles says is the
“quickest thrower on the staff.”

The infield looks good, but the
performance of several freshmen is
critical. Going ‘around the horn’—at
third is sophomore Alan Burton,
who at the present is sharing duty
there with pitcher-third sacker Jeff
Knauer. At second base, the Blue
have reliable Denny Hathaway, who
last year hit at a hot .341 chip.
Backing up Don are defensive mind-
ed Bill Sigler and Gerald Costello.

Shortstop finds “Mr. Dependable”
Doug Clelan. Clelan is in tremend-
ous shape due to basketball and is
playing “better than ever.” Digging
into first base one finds a gold mine
of talent. The position is currently
held by freshman John Rice, who
definitely has, according to Lyles,

good pro-ability.” Close on John's
heels at first is another freshman,
Henry Sempole.

The outfield appears to be tied
down by proven performers, One
slot is held by the long ball hitting
Dave Taylor. Another will be held
by Ellie Gutshall, who led the team
last year with a torrid 403 aver-
age. Gerald “Chip” Costello will fill
the third slot. Help is expected to
come from freshman Doug Paul and
Al Radcliff, and sophomore Ray
Rheault,

The schedule for the year looks
tough, but Coach Lyles is quick to

Stickmen Slide By Morgan State

W&L’s lacrosse team used a third
quarter scoring spree to get by
Morgan State 17-10 last Saturday,
then came on strong to whip Notre
Dame 17-5 in an exhibition match
on Monday.

Early in Saturday’s game, Morgan
State appeared to be a_ pushover.
Before the game was three minutes
old, W&L had a 3-0 lead on goals
by Ed Tognetti, Brian Chasney and
John Lalley. With the exception of
Wayne Jackson’s lone goal, Mor-
gan State did nothing in the first
quarter and trailed 4-1 after Ted
Bauer scored.

The second quarter was a different
story. Dave Warfield got a goal early
in the period, but Morgan State’s
Jackson scored unassisted to make
the score 5-2. The Generals’ of-
fense got sloppy, and rare accurate
pass by Morgan's goalie resulted in
an easy goal on a fast break. Rich
Romanelli answered that goal, but
Morgan got three more that period
to tie it up, 6-6. With 21 seconds
to go, Brian Chasney gave the Blue
a one-point lead, 7-6,

Morgan opened the third period
by scoring in 45 seconds, but it
was their last goal for a long time.
Sam Englehart started the Gen-
erals’ scoring with 13:46 left in the
period. Brian Chasney added his
third goal, but the Generals were in-
consistent, missing several chances
to score on fast breaks. The Blue
also had trouble getting their feed
passes inside. Englehart scored un-
assisted, and Chasney threw in his
fourth with 1:42 left in the quarter.
As ihe period ended, W&L played
more settled lacrosse and Skip Licht-
fuss chalked up his first goal with
only 38 seconds left, giving WAI
a 12-7 lead.

The fourth quarter scoring picked
up, with Ted Bauer drawing first
blood with Defenseman Don Eaven-
son livened up the crowd by going
the length of the field and scoring
unassisted, That would have blown
the game open, but Morgan State
scored on a weak shot to keep its
hopes alive,

As the period wore on, the Gen-
crals blew several chances on fast
breaks, consistently pulling up at
the restraining line or holding the
ball too long after a feed pass. With
8:10 left, Morgan State scored, nar-
rowing the margin 14-9, Freshman
Malcolm Hastings replaced Skeeter
Chadwick in the crease, but he saw
little action as the Generals offense

picked. up. The pressure on the
Morgan goal was bound to result in
goals, and it did, by Englehart and
Ken Miller. Jackson scored again
for Morgan State but the game was
out of reach. Ken Daniels finished
the scoring late in the game to give
WAL its biggest lead, 17-10.

As a team, Morgan State played
poorly, Of its ten goals, only one
was assisted, Most of its goals came
on face-offs or ground balls, with
one player getting an open shot un-
challenged. W&L goalies did not
perform well, but they got little sup-
port on fast breaks.

Against Notre Dame, W&L play-
ed better defense in an elaborate
“scrimmage”. The Irish played in-
spired, if incompetent, lacrosse.
Brian Chasney got an unassisted
goal with only 4:11 left in the first
period. Notre Dame controlled the

 

 

early part of the period but could
not score. W&L dominated the last
minutes, with the Notre Dame goal-
ie dropping a save into his goal for
the second General tally, Notre
Dame scored once in the first quar-
ter, their only score of the half.

[he roof fell in on the Irish in the
second quarter, as the Generals scor-
ed seven goals. Bob Brumback and
Don Carroll both scored twice, with
Lichtfuss, Lalley and Englehart each
adding one apiece. The Generals
took a 9-1 lead into the dressing
room,

Carroll and Englehart dominated
the third quarter, with Don feeding
Sam from behind the crease for
three goals. Carroll also passed to
Jim Steiff for a goal, and Chasney
helped Englehart to his fourth goal
of the quarter.

Notre Dame managed one goal in

the third period coming, as usual, on
a fast break following a face-off,

Bob Brumback’s third goal late
in the final period gave the Gen-
erals a 15-2 lead, The scoring pace
slowed as the Generals substituted
heavily. Ted Bauer threw one that
the Notre Dame goalie never even
saw, but the Irish finally managed
to score again while W&L was a
man short following a penalty. John
Aaron scored the Generals’ seven-
teenth and final goal, but the Fight-
ing Irish got a couple of cheapies in
the last minute, the final one coming
when Bill Hoatson left the crease to
help scrap for a loose ball. Final
score: 17-5,

These three young men just made the

discovery of a lifetime. The oldest is 34.

Remember when young people could get ahead in busi-
ness simply by growing old? It was a good system for
those with a little talent and a lot of patience, but today’s
technology moves too fast to wait for seniority.

At Kodak, our extensive involvement in basic research
has made the need for fresh, young thinking more press-
ing than ever. So we hire the best new talent we possibly
ean. Then we do both of us a favor by turning them loose
on real problems, and giving them the freedom and re-

sponsibility they need to solve them.

That's how three Kodak scientists in their early thir-
ties just made a breakthrough in liquid lasers, develop-
ing an organic dye laser with a continuous beam. Their

 

discovery means more than just a new kind of laser. It
means a whole range of new laser applications, in fields
from medicine to communications.

It was the kind of discovery most men and women
work a lifetime for. Yet these young men still have most
of their lifetimes ahead of them.

Why de we give young men and women so much free-
dom and responsibility? Because it’s good business, and
we're in business to make a profit. But in furthering our

own business interests, we also further society's inter-

ests. And that’s good
After all, our business depends on society. So we care
what happens to it.

whether or not these students are to
be reimbursed a proportion of their
investment corresponding to con-
certs mot received. By our legal
standards, they are entitled to such
a reimbursement; the Dance Board
is blatantly guilty of breach of
contract,

Phe important point, however, is
that legal means should not be nec-
essary. We talk a lot about indivi-
dual honor at Washington and Lee.
Well, what about the honor of our
elected student officers? Frankly, the
students who bought Dance Board
Plan Cards are getting screwed be-
cause they put faith in these officers.

If the Dance Board does not have
the necessary funds, then the Exe-
cutive Committee should step in, It
is with the EC that final responsibil-
ity to right this wrong lies. I can
only hope that the students we have
chosen to sit in judgment of other
students honor recognize this re-
sponsibility, both to their office and
to themselves.

Also, I am just as hopeful that
this lesson will prompt a more seri-
ous reflection before promises are
made to WA&L students in the future.

ord,

Coach Tom Davies has an able
group to choose his top six from
with returning lettermen Marshall
Washburn (this year’s Captain), San-
dy Lawrence, John Embree, Tim
Thompson, Stan Taylor, and of
course, Warren Davis,

Pressing hard on the heels of the
upperclassmen are freshmen Will
Palfrey and Don Caffery. Because of
the surplus of talent, a J.V. team
will be formed this season for the
first time.

With little change in last year’s
schedule, the Generals toughest op-
ponents appear to be U.Va, Har-
vard and the University of South
Carolina. The squad will be com-
peting in the VCAA championships
for the first time this year.

The season will get into full
swing during the spring break, when
WAL. will hit the road on a trip to

Florida. On the way, a stop at the
U. of S. Carolina will be made all
the more difficult since the Harvard
tennis team also plans to attend.

Charlie Strain Reviews

Basketball Season

was not critical of the coach’s de-
cision, suggesting only that “when
things are going bad a coach will
tend to start playing personalities,”
However, “unless a person is sure of
his position he’s not going to play
up to his capabilities.”

Why did Charlie come to W & L’?
After attending the University of
South Carolina for a year, he wish-
ed for something “smaller, and
somewhere I could play ball, | hurt
my knee in high school but Coach
Canfield still showed interest, so
largely because of ‘him I decided to
come here. This seemed like an ideal
place to play, since there’s no pres-
sure because there’s no scholarships
and there’s virtually no pressure from
the fans. When winning becomes the
only end, organized sports is a little
disillusioning.”

What about next year’s team?
“There's definitely a lot of talent,
Norm Kristoff is capable of domi-
nating games with his size and
strength. Gary Fitzgerald has as
much natural ability as anyone whos
ever played for W & L — including
guys like ‘Magic Mel’ and Mike
Neer. Another freshmen, John Pod-
gajny, also shows a lot of ability
and can hit from the outside. He's
got a lot of fire and plays like a city
ballplayer. Those guys should be in-
teresting to watch for the next few
years.”

W&L’s Faculty?

frail man was nevertheless a tower-
ing intellect on the W&L campus.
During his stay in Lexington he
published several books, wrote many
papers and in general, established
himself as a pioneer in his field.
However, in the last years his con-
dition weakened him both physically
and mentally. The quality and gen-
ius of his work was drastically di-
minished. He resigned shortly after
running out of the shower room
holding a cardboard crown scream-
ing “Eureka, Eureka!” His paper on
increasing the mechanical advan-
tage of Catherine the Great's block
and tackle system was never made
public.

With this rather somber conclu-
sion the list of extraordinary faculty
members comes to a close. As all
the great intellects have said at least
once in their lives, “To understand
fully the complexities and wonders
of our age, we must first understand
the soil from whence they camest!”

Let us thank these hardy men
who through their sweat and blood
made this a better school to learn in
and a better world to raise our chil-
dren in, if we have any.

Will Wife-Swapping
Better Their Curve?

By BILL AUSTIN

The splendid green-season sport
will never be the same again, for its
titans, its bigger-than-life perform-
ers of bat, ball and glove, have slip-
ped into the mire that encompasses
the rest of us,

Last week, when proud baseball's
fortunes seemed to rise with an
ending to the yearly parade of Mar-
vin Miller—led grievances, a pair
of pin-striped jokers disrupted the
sun-shine beauty of spring training
with their bizarre confessions,

Golden-armed Fritz Peterson, last
year’s 17-game winner on the im-
posing mound corps of the New
York Yankees, disclosed the mind-
harrowing details. He and best pal
Mike Kekich, another pitcher of
less breath-taking statistics, had in-
dulged in a wife- swapping of un-
usual permanency. The trade not
only included willing spouses, but
bubbling offspring (save the eldest of
each brood), and alas, even family
pets. The fun began last summer
when the two couples viewed a
rather provocative movie, stimulat-
ing their previously caged desires
for a closer knitting of the group's
companionship. A lot of nervous
joking and laughter accompanied
the subject, but evidently its lure
was not lost on the lusty Kekich.
He soon approached the unflappable
Peterson with his scorching passion
for Mrs. P., and Jim Bouton’s for-
merally in oddity readily agreed to
a consummation o fthe surging emo-
tion.

With a pennant race's heatedness
providing the romantic back-drop,
Fritz bestowed his wife to friend
Mike, and in turn received the ac-
quiescent Sussanne K. The deal
grew to include an exchange of
home addresses, and ultimately, at
seaosn’s conclusion, a full-time ac-
cordance was reached.

The situation appeared to inspire
universal bliss until winter's chill
found Mr. Kekich and Mrs, Peter-
son “bumping heads” stubbornly
over domestic matters. Meanwhile,
frolicsome Fritz and Mrs. Kekich
enjoyed a relationship of divine har-
mony, finding a happiness never be-

fore experienced in love, family, ex-
istence,

When Kekich asked for a reture
to the normalcy of the pre-trade ar-
rangement, Peterson balked, assert-
ing that nothing, even friendship,
could undermine ‘his love's lasting-
ness. Mrs. Fritz left the losing hur-
ler (Kekich), finding solace in the
arms of shocked parents, while the
abandoned one maintained a surly,
hate-filled silence. As he admitted
begrudgingly to the reporter-mobs
who examined him ceaselessly, “our
friendship’s over . . . I'm left with
nothing.”

At present, Fritz and Sue con-
tinue to coo in the ecstasy of the
achieved union, They deny any taint
of smuttiness in the entire affair, and
report that fan mail is in their favor,
The masses approve,

Unfairly, the melodrama has over-
shadowed the bright prospects tout-
ed by this year’s Yankees, an outfit
strengthened by the acquisitions of
powerful Craig Nettles and spray-
hitting Matty Alou. In fact, one
competent Las Vegas sage has in-
stalled the legend-coated team as a
9-5 favorite in 1973's AL East.

As expected, baseball trade rumors
flourished when Peterson admitted
to his domestic reorderings, as a
fearful management sought to pre-
vent the spreading of the ex-friends’
animosity into the morale of the rest
of the club. Ralph Houk, fiesty
field boss of the Yanks and surely no
liberated soul, would only concede
that personal lives did not necessar-
ily affect field effectiveness. Others
judged more sternly. Lindy MceDan-
iel, a lay minister of great devotion,
cast a mournful gaze up the activi-
ties of the playful teammates. “It’s
not very pretty, is it?”

Now, at the outset of a campaign
of potential, news-reapers flock to
the smirking Peterson or the sullen
Kekich rather than to the team’s
exhibition performances. As the
much-abused Kekich blurbed this
past weekend after working a cou-
ple of shaky innings: “Why don't
you guys go up and watch the rest
of the game? You might miss some-
thing”.

They might...

versial issue when he refused to

“The people of Virginia have decid-

He declined to speculate on what his
position would be if parimutuel bet-

General Assembly during the next
four years.

He then revealed that “a young man

pretext of a term paper... I gave
him a good deal of background . . .

Washington Lacrosse club, made up
of former players from such schools
as Hopkins and Maryland. The fol-
lowing weekend, they must face
some of the best lacrosse teams in
the country in the Hero’s Tourna-
ment. Morgan State played the Gen-
erals even in recovering ground
balls. The Generals have not played
good defense, at least not against
Morgan, Coach Jack Emmer has
said the goals will come, and they
have. But the number of unassisted
goals indicates the Blue has not
played good indiivdual defense so
far. Mt. Washington will not be im-
pressed by last Monday's perfor-
mance.

one, but then the talent and ability
to meet such a schedule seems to be
trere also. In reference to the flood
of ability of this year’s frosh group,
Lyles said that he questions “if some
of last year's starters would be start-
this year had this year’s freshmen
been around last year.” So it should
be an exciting spring for baseball at
WAL, one of 1 championship team
trying to rebound to an even better
year, It all starts this Saturday with

“Play Ball”, and opens another sea-
