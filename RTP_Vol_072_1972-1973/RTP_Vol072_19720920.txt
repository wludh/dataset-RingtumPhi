President Addresses Opening Assembly

Huntley Calls For New Trust

Washingten ant Lee began its
224th academic year last Wednes-
day with the official noon opening
convocation held in the New Dore-
mus gymnasium. President R. E. R.
Huntley, by tradition, delivered the
opening address, challenging W&L
to maintain its “community of trust
and simultaneously to pursue acade-
mic excellence” in the stead of ex-

tensive physical improvements on
the campus.
Huntley acknowledged the fact

that Washington and Lee begins the
year with a record enrollment of
approximately 1,700 students in the
School of Law and the undergradu-
ate schools. Among the “firsts” of
the year will be six women in the
law school—the first female students
ever admitted to pursue a W&L de-
gree.

Although actual coeducation is
still limited to the law school, one
Hampden-Sydney man and 21 wom-
en (predominantly from Hollins
College) will attend W&L this year
in the undergraduate schools as part
of the Eight-College transfer pro-
gram, either for the full year or for
one or two terms,

The record enroliment includes
393 freshmen, by far the largest ever
at W&L.

Huntley applauded the fact that
not only was the goal for alumni
funds exceeded last year, but the
goal for parental funds aws ex-
ceeded as well. He announced that
the preparation of the site for the
new law facility was already under
way; also, he said, the contract for
the new law building (made possible
by the $9-million gift by Frances
and Sydney Lewis of Richmond)
would be drawn up this winter.

On the financial front Huntley
pointed confidently to the fact that

Says Rush Chairman—

interest on student loans is diminish-
ing, allowing for the allocation of
more student aid in the future. The
project annual budget, he added, is
projected at $6,8-million.

“Planning on the undergraduate
library is well under way,” Huntley
said, and continued that housing for
married students and other addi-
tional undergraduate dormitories are
scheduled to see construction within
the next year or two.

Having established the financial
blessings which have been recently

bestowed on the university, Huntley
called on students and facully to
make a new commitment to acade-
mic progress at the university. He
recalled several past speeches of Dr.
James G. Leyburn, who, as a past
dean of the university, had helped
set the academic goals of Washing
ton and Lee for the “60's and 70's
Huntley said that the major aims

faculty and student body, a striving

A pplications Currently Bein g Accepted
For 2 Graduate Program Study Grants

Applications are currently being
accepted for two graduate study
opportunities, the Danforth Fellow-
ships and the Fulbright-Hays Pro-
gram for Study abroad.

The Danforth Fellowship program
was begun in 1952 by the Danforth
Foundation. The fellowships are
open to all qualified persons who are
planning to enter an accredited U.S.
graduate school in the fall of 1973.
The program is designed for stu-
dents planning careers in teaching
and/or administration at the college
level,

Applicants must also be under 30
years of age, and they must not yet
have undertaken any graduate or
professional study beyond the bac-
calaureate.

Grants under the Danforth pro-
gram are awarded for one year, and
are normally renewable until com-
pletion of the degree up to a maxi-
mum of four years. Fellowship sti-

Rush Proceeding

Even with an inundation of books,
homework, adjusting to college life,
and just “getting into the swing of
things,” 320 of the 393 members of
the class of 1976 are currently par-
ticipating in Rush activities.

In fact, freshmen are taking to
fraternities more this year than was
the case last fall, or at least that’s
what early trends seem to say.

“From all indications. it's going
extremely well this year.” states
Rush Chairman John Syvertsen.

UTLOOK and REVIEW

September 20, 1972

September Song

Like it or not, the month of September is back for a return
engagement. That great summer party is over, and a whole new
party (or whatever) is about to begin.

As President Huntley stressed in his opening address, we
embark on what is, at least in terms of pure growth, one of the
most exciting years in the university's history. The bulldozers
have already moved in to clear land for the new law. school
buildings. Upperclass dormitories and the new library are
passing from the drawing board stage. This year’s freshman
class is the largest ever, and significantly enough, was drawn
on a more selective basis than those of Johns Hopkins or Cor-
nell, among others,

Not to mention our sheer joy at welcoming the 20 some-odd
exchange coeds to the undergraduate schools and the six femin-
ine lawyers-to-be, who are new to the campus this year.

We trust this means growth for Washington and Lee, not
just in terms of physical expansion, but in educational quality
and achievement as well. The opportunities are there.

Whatever hapens during the course of the year, we at the
Ring-tum Phi will do our best to keep you abreast of events and,

For Tennis Freaks Only

Its a warm, sunny day during the first few weeks of school,
the work load isn’t too strenuous yet, so what do you do while
waiting for that inevitable mid-October crunch? Play tennis,
of course, So you grab a partner and bop on down to the tennis

six other people waiting on the benches to play.

with an untouched sandwich and an
unwanted orange, I walk over to his

He looks up at me with eyes as blue

Upon the railing that lines the

old men of Lexington, weary sold-

glacier, leaving furrous and scars of
events. They look like the backwash
of any city, any size: the
deadman’s clothes, the same broken
posture, the same hollow eyes. Rest-
ing hands like hunks of rotting
stumps on the mental railing, they
reminisce the days away. Main
Street bustles by, but that railing is
a time machine, a tube into the past,

‘Modern’ Boulez Revives Past !

With this column we inaugurate
a new series of reviews and articles
on music—all kinds of music, in
fact, including classical, rock, jazz,
and blues, Highlighted will be criti-
ques from Pat Hinely and Richard
Johnson, though anyone interested
in writing for this series is invited to
submit an sample column to us in
the Ring-tum Phi office. Most of the
records reviewed will be obtained
in the Co-op’s record store. This
week Johnson provides some
thoughts on New York Philharmonic
director Pierre Boulez and the emer-
gence of contemporary music,

—Ed,
By RICH JOHNSON
The music of the first two de-
cades of our century, now more

than years old, made a break with
its antecedents unprecedented in
previous musical revolutions from
Philippe de Vitry to Monteverdi to
Chopin, Liszt, and Wagner. For the
first time melody, rhythm, and har-
mony were simultaneously rethought
and recreated by the imagination of
a few men.

Debussy and Scriabin, who failed
to survive those two decades, initiat-
ed a harmonic revolution whose
consequences are to be heard in al-
most any popular song today. Un-
resolved dissonances gave harmony,
that uniquely western musical idea,
an eastern freedom from sequential-
ity.
Stravinsky wrought the change in
rhythm all by himself in three great
ballets: The Firebird, Petrushka, and
The Rite of Spring. He was followed
by Bartok in The Miraculous Man-

Summer of ’72:
Did Lexington
Change At All?

By BRYAN HATCHETT

lt may be a source of personal
security for some of us, to know
that upon returning to Lexington in
the fall, we will find it nearly indis-
tinguishable from the Lexington he
left in the spring.

But even in this haven for the
Daughters of the Confederacy time-
pinning for the ante-bellum
past, we have noted the following
modifications.

Was it only last spring when we
learned that 10 million tax exempt
dollars, donated by Sidney Lewis,
would be building a new law school.
Already part of the rewards of his
highly successful catalogue sales
firm is paying for those yellow cater-
pillars and dump trucks churning
up dust near the football field.

And inside the present law build-
ing, there is an innovation that our
future barristers seem to be taking
in stride, Girls, real live, honest to

darin and by his later American self
and most other Americans from the
forties on.

Under the scrutiny of Schoen
berg, melody, which in the guise of
theme had been a means of unify-
ing large musical statements, broke
down into sequences of intervals not
necessarily linked with particular
rhythmic expressions and emphases.
The tone row became a new basis
for musical construction, both melo-
dic and harmonic, and even today
opinion is divided: what has been
for some composers and listeners a
liberation from the rhetoric of past
musical forms seems for others only
a straitjacketing of personal expres-
sion,

The fate of Schoenberg's revolu-
tion is thus yet undecided, though we

have the subsequent developments
of Berg, Webern, Boulez, Nono,

and Stravinsky as evidence of its fer-
tility. But the revolutions in har-
mony and rhythm, though partially
recanted by their creators and used

as spice in generally more conserva-
tive frameworks (Stravinskyan and
French neo-classicism, or the neo-
romantic later works of Prokofiev
and Bartok), have undoubtedly suc-
ceeded, not only in composed music
since World War Two, which gen-
erally lies somewhere between We-
bern and Stravinsky, but in the most
innovative rock and jazz. Herbie
Hancock and Frank Zappa listen to
Stravinsky. Paradoxically, only the
most unstructured jazz sounds any-
thing like Schoenberg or Webern or

the even more highly structured
postwar serialism.
Now that Debussy’s harmonies

and Stravinsky’s rhythms surround
us from movie scores to Muzak, a
trip back to the roots is refreshing.
Pierre Boulez, in an excellently en-
gineered series of Columbia record-
ings. proves that the revolution in
music of half a century ago was
sensual as much as_ intellectual,
pleasure for the ear as well as the
mind,

University Center Plans
Open House Festivities

An activities fair, a coed party in
the Cockpit, Sunday films, a faculty-
student discussion series, and im-
proved service in the Cockpit.

These were some of the items of
business at the University Center
Committee’s first meeting of the
year last Monday.

An activities fair, complete with
combo party and a number of tour-
naments, is planned for this Satur-
day night in the University Center.
The combo “Voyce” will play in the
Cockpit beginning at 8:30 p.m. Ad-
mission is free. The film, The Bed-
ford Incident, originally scheduled
for Saturday night as part of the
activities fair, has been moved to
Sunday night in the Cockpit. The
tournaments include events in chess,
bridge, pinball and pool, with cash
prizes in each event. They will be-
gin at & p.m. Sign-up sheets are
available at the Bookstore and Uni-
veristy Center, with the entry dead-
line Thursday at 5 p.m.

The Committee is also planning a
coed party a week from Saturday,
on September 30, with Sweet Briat
College. With Sweet Briar girls as
special guests, the party will take
place in the Cockpit, with a live
combo. Bob Bruyere, co-chairman
of the committee, stated that “Sweet
Briar estimates that over 100 girls
will attend the event, and several
busses have been reserved to bring
them to the campus that night.”

Beginning tonight, at 8 p.m., a
weekly faculty-student discussion
series begins in the University Cen-
ter Library, according to Ken Lane,
the University Center Committee's
advisor. Tonight's guest is Professor
Harry Pemberton, chairman of the
Philosophy Department. The topic
is “The Achievement of the Living
and the Dead.” The program is open

WGL Intramurals:

What's Their Purpose?

By PALMER TRICE

What is the purpose of the In
ramural program? Is it a competi

m between houses to which
has the superior group of athletes,
or is it a program designed so that
even the most frustrated athletes
can participate and have fun? It is

very easy to say that should be

both—that the two goals can be
harmonized, But that is not to say
what it is now. In most houses, es

pecially the more athletic ones, the
competition is stiff, and the desire to
win is not just the primary goal, but
the only goal, Is this right? If it
isn’t, can we do something about it?
Should this be a matter of Univer-
sity policy, or is it something that
each house must determine on its
own?

Whatever the case
the football Generals open the 1972
season, hundreds of Wash
ington and Lee athletes will take
to the gridiron, as the 1972-73 In-
tramural season opens. Monday will
also see the commencement of com
petition in tennis and golf. Intra
mural manager John Runge says
that the I-M set-up will basically be

two days after

olnel

Navy vs

the same as last year's, with special
emphasis being put on development
of programs already begun.

Dut to a shortened rush, there
will be no programs set up specifi-
cally for freshmen. Rush ends two
weeks after the I-M season begins.

Tennis has been changed a bit
since last year. Matches will con-
sist of two singles contests and one
doubles, this being a cutback of two
singles contests from last year. This
was necessitated by the loss of the
hard courts, which were obliterated
in the early construction phases of
the law school, Construction has also
forced all football agmes to be play-
ed on the middle field,

Eligibility regulations have chang-
ed slightly. The Intramural Man-
ager has determined that inactive
members of a fraternity may not
participate in behalf of that frater-
nity. They can play only for the In-
dependent Union. Eating and/or
Social members of a house may
play for that house, if they are pay-
ng dues of at least $10.00 a month.

Aside from the forementioned
modification, John Runge says steps

Good Season Predicted

For Cross-Country, Soccer ©

By PAUL CAVALIERE, JR.
and TOM ANGELLO

“This could ‘be the best soccer
team in the school’s history, even
better than the team that went to
the Eastern Regionals four years
ago,” said head soccer coach Joe
Lyles. This team is loaded with ex-
perience, led by tri-captains Meade
Kempfmueller, Brandon Herbert,
and John Buckley, all seniors, The
team also has an excellent group of
sophomores, and a fine group of
freshmen, headed up by Bob Sillers,
Billy Cogar, and a very impressive
goalie in Jeff Baum. In total, there
are about fifty candidates out for
soccer,

Coach Lyles has stated that he
would go basically with the same
players as last year, since the team
lost no one to graduation. The
coach did say that he would add
many new formations and substitute
quite frequently.

Practices are running quite smooth-
ly. They consist of a lot of running
and scrimmages. During these scrim-
mages, players are urged to change
positions to get accustomed to play-
ing several positions,

The 1972 schedule will be a tough
one. With six games on the road,
the team must be mentally prepared
for all of its games. None of the
teams on the schedule are push-
overs, This rough away schedule is
headed up by the U.S. Naval Aca-
demy. The team does have four
home games, which should prove to
be thrillers,

Last Friday afternoon W&L
scrimmaged VMI and beat the
Cadets 7-2. Washington and Lee
was very aggressive. They had some
excellent line play, headed up by
Jimmy Fox and Billy Spofford, and
a fairly strong edfense anchored by

Rolf Piranian. The scrimmage show-
ed that we need to work a lot more
on our defense and on team passing.
The squad is looking forward to a
scrimmage this Sunday against the
University of Virginia at Charlottes-
ville. Game time is 2:00 p.m.

All in all, the Washington and
Lee University soccer team is very
enthusiastic, and they realize that
they have a combination that can
take them all the way to the Eas-
tern Regionals again, This team has
a vast amount of experience and
plenty of depth to carry it through
its tough schedule. Coach Lyles
couldn't have said it better, “This
could be the best soccer team in the
school’s history.”

Coach Dick Miller’s harriers open
the cross country season at Centre
College on September 30. This sea-
son promises to be an exciting one
with marked improvement over last
year’s 3-7 record, Despite the loss of
standout Carter Glass, co-captains
Bill Kalal and Bob Sherwood return
to lead the Generals.

Much of the favor over the new
year is over sophomore Stu Nibley,
who has taken over the No. 1 spot.
Although pre-season workouts have
just begun, it is evident that Nibley
will be the premier runner. Coach
Miller anticipates that he will be
one of the best runners in Washing-
ton and Lee history.

For 1972-73 the Generals will
field a great deal more depth than
last year, The ranks are beefed up
by twelve promising freshmen. Dur-
ing time trials this past Saturday,
Tem Washington, Doug McNeel,
Mike Burns, and Bill Garrison all
ran with varsity potential.

The toughest dual meet of the
year is expected to come from

Football Season
Blue Takes On Titans,

pens:

Winners of Last 22

By LEWIS HIXSON

The 1972 season looks a great
leal more promising than it did a
year ago at this time. Last year
coach Buck Leslie started the sea-
ion with a relatively young and in-
‘xperienced team and it showed as
hey dropped their first four games
while averaging only 4 points per
zontest. However, those four games
were very valuable in terms of ex-
perience and the team came back to
lake 4 of 5. It was a complete re-
versal as the Generals averaged 25
points while holding their opponents
0 12 points per game ,during the
ast half of the season.

This year Coach Leslie has 31
‘eturning lettermen from that squad
hat finished so well last year, Strong
points remain at almost all positions
on offense while some patchwork
will be needed on defense, The back-
lield should be a good one as it in-
cludes Steve Fluharty at the helm
giving out instructions to Tom Van
Amburgh and Jim Farrar at Tail-
back and Fullback respectively. Van
Amburgh came on strong at the
tnd of last season and from all in-
ications, he should be ready to
pick up where he left off. Jim Far-
rar is the man who likes to run into
and over people and seems to ad-
here to the theory that the shortest
distance to the goal line is a straight
line.

Steve Fluharty is back for his sen-
ior year and seems ready to make it
his best one, although that may be
hard to do. He was ranked 7th in
the country his sophomore year and
last year was first team All-State and
All-Conference. He'll be throwing
lo the same receivers as he did last
year and that can’t hurt. Chappy
Conrad, who shared All-State and
All-Conference honors with Flu-
harty, should be on the receiving
end of many passes and although
he’s recovering from a bruised knee,
he is slated to be starting on Sat-
urday. Conrad also punted for a
40.6 yard average, which placed him
13th in the nation in that specialty.
Besides Conrad, Bill Baldwin and
Mark Lane will be returning to their
old positions at end and flanker re-

spectively. Lewis Powell is the best
back-up quarterback around, Coach
Leslie has complete confidence in
his ability to move the team,

Although this looks very promis-
ing, the strongest point on offense
this year could well be the line. The
entire offensive line that worked so
well together by the end of last sea-
son returns, Bob Brand and Buz
Walters will be at the tackles, while
Archer Frierson, Don Eavenson, and
Lanny Rainey are well experienced
at the guard position and Ed Ko-
wal is back at center.

Coach Leslie is hoping that this
group will hold up well during the
first part of the season, allowing
some other players to get some gra-
dual and unhurried experience, Over-
all, the chances look very good that
the offense can pick up where it left
off last year.

If problems are going to occur at
the start of the season, it is likely
that they will be found on defense.
Despite the loss to graduation, there
is still good leadership in the de-
fensive areas of the line, linebackers,
and secondary, Tim Haley is tough
as linebacker and was one of the
team leaders in tackles last season.

Marshall Washburn should add
the leadership needed to the second-
ary, and he'll be calling the signals

for the pass defense. John Mark
ley and Ed McLaughlin are expect
ed to hold down their positions in
the line very solidly and should get
yme help from Bucky Leslie and
Johnny Sorrels. Linebackers Jim
Nolan, Jay Fulcher, and David
Turk, and Backs Mark  Diverio,
Jack Davidson and Bill Wallace
will make up the rest of the de-
fense,

The first game of the season
should test the defense quickly
enough, Westminister is a tough
opener for the Generals as they'll
try to make it 23 straight on Satur-
day. That's right, they’ve won 22 in
a row, after taking their opener last
week against Lockhaven by a 28-6
score. Coach Leslie says that,
“They're not unbeatable,” but
“they'll outweigh us and throw quite
a bit.” It should be a hard fought
game and the beginning of a sched-
ule that will be every bit as diffi-
cult as last year. Although we don’t
play Bucknell or the Coast Guard
this year, the Blue will face Deni-
son along with Westminister, and
Leslie feels that it may not be a
change for the better. Without a
doubt, there will be a wide open
game at Wilson Field this Saturday

as the Generals open a new season.

Summer of ’72
In Lexington

(Continued from page 3)
God, “nothin’ like a dame,” girls
are enrolled at Washington and Lee
for the first time.

Recent exchange programs have
briefly brought to our classrooms
that combination of lace, ruffles, and
denim which is the modern col-
lege girl, but these are the first fe-
males in line to receive a W&L de-
gree.

Conspicious by their absence this
semester will be Henry Sloss and
Dr. James Leyburn (though the lat-
ter showed up for a nostalgic even-
ing last week). In no way related
to the loss of either of these gentle-
men, but for what it’s worth, Bob
Keefe is donning the academic garb
again this year. The Director of the
University’s Office of Public In-
formation will teach an introductory
course to journalism,

Enough for the additions and
losses on campus. Downtown, the
free enterprise system suffered a
notable setback with the demise of
the Band Box Record Store. ....
It is rumored that a neighboring
greasy spoon will turn off the grill
for the last time within the near
ae and Ma Bell is ex-
panding her Lexington facilities, no
doubt in part, because of her ill
gotten dimes, lost by freshman, fail-
ing to read the directions on the
local pay phones,

Politically, Lexington has been
relocated into the Sixth Congres-
sional District of Virginia. In previ-
ous elections, Rockbridge County
has been included in the Seventh
District now represented by Con-
gressman Kenneth Robinson.

Students registered to vote in
Lexington as well as the good bur-
ghers themselves will choose among
three candidates for the House of
Representatives. The  incumbant
sixth district representative, Richard
Poff, will not seek re-election, choos-
ing to end his long career in Wash-
ington so he might serve as a justice
on the bench of the State Supreme
Court of Appeals.

And finally in this time of truth
in advertising. informed sources tell
us that WREL, the local radio sta-
tion, has spent a bundle on “jingles”
that will musically tell its listeners
that "WREL is Love.”.....

“We are very pleased to have
someone of Jack Emmer’s ability at
Washington and Lee.” said Me-

under Coach Szlasa.”

teams have posted an overall mark
of 31-8. won or shared two division
championships and advanced to the

his new poistion at Navy.”
