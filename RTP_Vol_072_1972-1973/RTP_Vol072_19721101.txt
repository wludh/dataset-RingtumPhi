 

Troilus and Cressida wind their way between the bars of the “jungle-jim” set designed for W&L’s production of
Shakespeare’s drama.

‘Troilus And Cressida’
Premieres Next Tuesday

On Tuesday night, November 7
the University Theatre will open
with a production of one of Shake-
speare’s most difficult plays, “Troi-
lus and Cressida.” Lee Kahn has di-
rected a predominately young cast,
and Ken Barnes has described an
innovative “jungle-jim” set.

Of course, this play has been
produced in other ways, and Dr.
G. W. Ray of the English depart-
ment provides a background story
on stage history below. Junior Bill
Austin treats the thematic aspects
on page 2.

Faculty Vote For McGovern

 

 

Nixon Sweeps Student Poll

President Richard Nixon, capturing 53% of the 733 stu-

dent votes, won overwhelmingly in last Friday's mock elec-
tion, sponsored by the Ring-tum Phi and the Political Science
Club. George MeGovern polled 38% of the student vote. 8%,

either expressed no opinion or wrote in a candidate (eight

students voted for John Schmitz for President).

But, among the Washington and Lee faculty, the trend was

almost reversed, with MeGovern capturing 53% of the fac-
ulty votes. Nixon won 35% of the 106 faculty ballots.

In the student balloting,

the race for vice-president was

much closer than it was for president. Here, Vice-President

Spiro Agnew took 49% of the vote, while R.

‘

won out:

\gnew's 31%.

The breakdown by classes in the
presidential vote is as follows: fresh-

men (195 voters)}—Nixon 70%, Me

Govern 25%; sophomores (119 vot-
ers}—Nixon 55%, McGovern 35%;

ed prodigy at once defies and de-
rides all definitive comment.” Yet in
this complex mixture of comic, sa-
tiric, historic, romantic, tragic, and
epic matter Shakespeare, has used
his brilliant intellectual powers and
dramaturgic skills, to create inter-
locking ironic parallels and con-
trasts which ultimately test the many
verbalized abstractions of Love,
War, Value, Time, and Honor on
the bedrock battlefield of Reality.

Stage History

The toughest problems and pit-
falls, however, are faced not by
critics or scholars, but by those few
directors and companies courageous
(foolish?) enough to stage such a
demanding drama. This play about

heroes of yesteryear requires ap-
propriate heroic measures from
those who seek to enact it. For

openers, the would-be director con-
fronts a massive text of some 3300
lines; in the canon only Richard Hl
and Hamlet (written just prior to
Troilus) are longer. Besides sheer
Mass, there are problems of Energy.
Troilus is short on action and fast-
paced dialogue, but long on inertia
and self-consciously rhetorical and
interminable set speeches, taxing
enough for sophisticated actors. No
wonder actor-manager John Philip
Kemble never produced the play
though he did manage to cut and
cast it!

Thus it will come as no surprise
to learn that performances of Troi-
lus and Cressida have been extreme-
ly cut and conceived ones the rear-
est of all. The ensuing short stage
history of Troilus also suggests a
relationship between the increasing
frequency of Troilus performances
in modern time and the prolifera-
tion of Shakespeare festivals, uni-
versity theatres and various perman-
ent Shakespeare companies in Eng-
land, Canada, and America. The
sudden recent popularity of Troilus,
however, can only be attributed to
the timeliness and profound engage-
ment of its central themes.

During the Restoration, the great
age of Shakespeare's “improvers’”,
Troilus trod the boards in John
Dryden's infamous alteration, Troi-
lus and Cressida or Truth Found
Out Too Late (1679). This perver-
sion, replete with numerous addi-
tions do and abridgments of the ori-
ginal, is most notable for a Cressida
who remains faithful to Troilus
throughout. After the final Covent
Garden revival of Dryden's revision
in 1734, Troilus retired to the “clo-
1907 when Charles Fry

set” until

In a Curriculum Committee re-
port given by Dick Marsh, he said
his commitiee was looking into why
the teacher of a course has to know

ing into the possibility of all stu
dents being given marks and to have
them changed in the Registrar's of-
fice to Pass-Fail if need be.

London. Soon after, William Poel’s
Elizabethan Stage Society produced
an unusually pictorial, but severely-
cut Troilus. Poel’s characteristically
bare stage was draped with black
and purple curtains. Thersites, Aene-
as, and Paris were played by ac-
tresses, Poel himself played the sy-
philitic Pandarus, but the occasion
was memorable mainly for the elo-
quent wantonness of Edith Evans’
Cressida. In 1922 a vigorous ver-
sion done by the Marlowe Society
with an all-male cast (paying back
Poel?) initiated the custom of black-
clad Myrmidons who surround the
unarmed Hector like vampires.
The first of many “modern dress”
experiments was Michael MacOwen’s

when cormorant war” threatened.
The Trojans wore khaki, the Greeks
pale blue uniforms, Ulysses was a
diplomat with gold eyeglasses, Ther-
sites a bedraggled left-wing reporter,
and Pandarus a passe roue. Tyrone
Gutherie also essayed modern dress

in his uncut but otherwise icono-
clastic revival at the Old Vic in
1956. Audiences gazed upon the

antics of pre-World War I militar-
ists, the Trojan War translated into
a struggle between Ruritania and a
coalition of Central European
Powers. The frivolous Trojans, stage
historians tell us, were “resplendent
in yellow with plumed brass helmets
and heliograph-winking __ breast-
plates” whereas the factious Greeks,
given to much Nazi heel-clicking of
their jackboots, sported spiked hel-
mets and bristly mustaches. Cres-
sida wore a_ hobble-skirted riding
habit, Thersites was a seedy war
correspondent with sketchbook and
camera, and Helen seductively tickl-
ed the ivories of her grand piano,
Altogether, a delight for Camp fol-
lowers.

rhersites, Eric Porter's Ulysses, and
Max Adrian's Pandarus. In the
strongly homosexualized 1968 Royal
Shakespeare production, however,
any earlier thematic imbalance is
more than redressed by Barton, now
the sole director. He gives us lechery
enough with such business as naked

OUTLOOK and REVIEW!
Election 72

There is one, final, rip-roaring week in this Presidential
campaign, and the suspense is simply killing us. President
Nixon attempts to fight off embarrassment launched from two

fronts—one from Hanoi, over the Halloween Peace Pact that
never got signed; the second from the media, with the Wash-
ington Post in the vanguard, concerning the espionage appar-
ently perpetrated by the someone in the White House.

Meanwhile, Senator McGovern criss-crosses the country,
lashing out... over Watergate, President Thieu, and Nixon’s
recent veto of a whole slate of social legislation,

Yet, outside of the candidates themselves, no one seems to
be particularly enthralled by this performance. This was to be
the first election in quite awhile where the differences on the
issues would be clear-cut; the choice, well-defined.

But while Nixon manages to cling to a commanding lead
over his opponent, his coattails seem surprisingly short—he
will, by every estimate, fail to pull enough Republican can-
didates with him to gain control of either House in Congress.

Faced with this picture of Election ‘72, the staff of the
Ring-tum Phi has decided not to lend our coveted endorse-
ment to either candidate, Our reasons are these: (a) we were
pretty much split down the middle, as to our individual Presi-
dential preferences, and (b) even if we did endorse someone,
who'd really care anyway?

We thought a much more constructive contribution would
be to conduct a poll to find out what Washington and Lee stu-
dents thought about the race. So, joining hands with our
friends in the Political Science Club, we set to work.

Unfortunately, our effort was somewhat sabotaged, not
by the Committee to Re-Elect the President, but by our own
errors. First, we neglected to put the American Party ticket
of Schmitz-Anderson on the ballot. We did this, not because
of any insidious motive to supress right-wing sentiments, but
rather to restrict our survey to a major party poll. Neverthe-
less, Schmitz and his running mate received several write-ins
and probably would have grabbed more votes had their names
been on the sheet.

Secondly, our question about amnesty for draft resisters
was admittedly unclear. We should have offered an alterna-
tive to a straight yes-or-no answer, e.g., “yes, if they agree to
two year's of public service.” Many people, again, penned in
their own qualifications for amnesty.

So the results, as printed on our front page this week,
show Mr. Nixon as the winner, 54% to 38% for McGovern,
The really interesting statistic was Sargent Shriver’s victory
over Spiro Agnew as the Vice-Presidential choice. And what
about the generally far-from-poor W&L students rating the
economy as Issue Number One?

\s we head into the final stretch, W&L students have,
rather astoundingly, chosen Nixon with almost the same
percentages now predicted by Messrs, Gallup and Harris for
November 7, We may have messed up the Mock Convention,
but this, folks, is the Big Time. Could it really be true after
all: as W&L goes, so goes the nation?

The University Council

We get the distinct impression that freshmen, and many
upperclassmen, really don't know what or who the Univer-
sity Council is. So here's a chance to find out.

The UC consists of 12 students and 12 faculty members,
alternately chaired by the student body president and the uni-
versity president. Its primary power lies in the administration
of student affairs. In other words, the University Council has
the last say on most non-academic questions,

It was in its function as social regulator that the Univer
sity Council two years ago passed the elimination of uniform
parietal hours in the dormitories and fraternities

Further, the group serves as a general forum and advisor
on policy matters. It provides the most amenable way for
faculty, administration, and students to exchange views on
the issues concerning the university as a whole,

Tonight the UC holds its November meeting, at 7:30 in
the EC room, On the agenda is one issue which sparked con
siderable response in these pages during the first weeks of
W&L. Also

for discussion is the Honor System, with particular attention

Shakespeare As Cynic

A Look At “Troilus and Cressida’

Play’s Themes

By BILL AUSTIN

A powerful dose of Shakespeare's
cynicism invades Lexington next
week with the presentation of Troi-
lus and Cressida by the University
Theatre. Set in the seventh year of
Troy’s ten-year siege, the work calls
upon humanity’s noble ones, its my-
thological heroes, to display woeful
inadequacy when faced with man-
hood’s primary tests of love and
war.

Troilus’ beloved Cressida betrays
him by lusting for another, evidence
of passion’s folly in creatures over-
stuffed with the hot juices of desire.
In a similar fashion, Hector’s fon-
dest love, honorable combat, lures
him to disaster with the treacherous
Achilles, man-child who pays no
such homage to virtue. These trag-
edies gain a certain element of

Letters
To the Editor

Are Saunas Important?

lo the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

The 1972 Presidential election is
nigh, right? An interesting commen-
tary on campus concern is last
week’s letter concerning the Dore-
mus bureaucracy’s nasty rulings on
sauna usage. Shall we write a letter
to our new president and ask him
what a purely democratic ruling
would be on such an issue?

Perhaps there are no more impor-
tant topics of conversation on the
hill than who is permitted to use the
saunas and when. Certainly there is
a wider-ranging principle involved.
However, it seems to me that a
senior might have better things to
think about. The issues at W&L
should be raised, but what, really,
are the issues?

Brian Richardson, °73

Only One Applicant
To the Editor of the Ring-tom Phi:

Some time ago the Executive
Committee announced the opening
of positions for freshmen on the
four standing subcommittees of the
EC, Along with Dennis Michaud, |
am co-chairman of the University
Center Committee, and we were
somewhat dismayed and disappoint-
ed by the level of response we got—
there was one freshman who applied.

At one time W&L was proud of
its concept of student government—
students actually decided many
major policy decisions. If such pride
exists, where is it? If such students
exist, where are they? You tell me.

Our committee has planned and
carried out many ideas—some new
and some old—ranging from Sweet-
briar mixers to happy hours to art
exhibits The list goes on and on.
We have a substantial budget from
which to draw, and we seek stu-
dents, like ourselves, who would
like to be an integral part in trying
to turn W&L into a more cohesive
and united community.

li’s not that hard to do, If you
are interested in helping us—and
this plea is not limited to freshmen
but to any student—please contact
either myself or Dennis or Ken
Lane, the University Center director.

comedy’s relief in the deformed per-
sonage of Thersites, garrulous Greek
whose scathing remarks expose the
entire affair as mere bickering over
a cuckold and whore,

In effect, Shakespeare takes a
world of the idealized past and ex-
poses it for its true nature. Men
who speak of acting with the wisdom
of reason cavort in the wasteland of
foolish sensuality. Rhetoric flows
without limit or scruple as the gods’
favorites scramble for personal ful-
fillment, oblivious to finer impulses,

Before Shakespeare's perceptive

eye, mighty Achilles proves to be
cowardly and selfish. Hector, Troy’s
champion, meets death as a slaugh-

 

tered animal. Helen and Cressida,
women of great physical beauty,
emerge morally repulsive as infidel-
ity’s pawns,

Even Troilus, the wronged lover
whose heart demands bloody re-
venge, is little more than an infatu-
ated romantic with a core of lust.
Passion rules his eyes, as it does all
whose supposed idealism finds its
base in vengeance and violence.

Shakespeare's view is a particular-
ly disturbing one, for in the play’s
final moments, it focuses on the cele-
bration of wanton destruction, Rea-
son's sole voice appears in the rav-
ings of mad Cassandra and is not
heeded. Men will die, and Troy will

Concerts In Review

fall before Greek deception, all for
an honor which does not exist out-
side the wagging tongues of the de-
bacles’ fools.

The tone of the work gains much
strength in the abundance of eating
imagery. This world is populated by
animals of gross appetites, beings
that sacrifice their glimpse of the
heavens for the lure of physical sat-
isfaction.

Shakespeare expects no saints on
a globe that holds little room for
the noble, the vulnerable. Yet he
despairs over the decline of love's
truth, and debases the glorification
of war, Indeed, “we go wrong, we

go wrong.” (V, i.)

Troilus and Cressida, rich in dia-
logue and, therefore, difficult to
grasp and judge quickly, presents an
intriguing challenge for both the pre-
senter and the audience, Sources
close to the heart of this univer-
sity’s production speak of a novel
approach to the work which will
hopefully accentuate the fine sub-
tlety of the language while updating
its impact.

Certainly, the play deserves at-
tention, Sadly enough, its themes are

timeless, and the artistic force which

iHuminated it is well worth thought-
ful observance. View the spectacle

 

and ponder the “withered truth,”
(V, ii.)
We have had several letters

and comments directed to us
concerning a paragraph in last
week's EC article. It stated: “A
laundry service for students is
being set up by Archer Frierson
and Mike Brittin to enable stu-
dents to have their gym uniforms
washed three times weekly at a
cost of one dollar per week, The
plan will go into effect in Janu-
ary but the EC urged students to
sign up now.” This was taken by
many students as a solicitation
by the members of the EC for a
profit-making venture,

This is not the case at all and
we apologize to Brittin and Frier-
son for the misleading nature of
the article. The laundry is in-
tended purely as a non-profit
service for students run by the
Doremus Gym crew; no EC
member or any other student
will receive any benefit from the
enterprise,

 

 

 

Bands Highlight Weekend

By W. PATRICK HINELY

It's not often that there are two
consecutive nights of good live
music here in beautiful Lexington.
The past weekend was a pleasant
exception,

Friday night, a Lexington-based
band, “Home,” played in the Cock-
pit, which | was told was standing
room only at one point, And, of
course, the price was right.

The members of “Home” are the
only local residents I've met who
are primarily interested in the music
they're making as well as the money.
(We've all gotta eat.) “Home” will
make it big one of these days; they
play well, and most important, they
play together Especially on their
own numbers, and they've written

 

some nice ones, the sum is greater
than its constituent parts “Now I’m
Free,” one of their originals, is so
far superior to the trash played on
commercial radio that I laugh when
I listen to WLLL these days.

At the same time “Home” was
working it out in the Cockpit, two
acoustic musicians were doing some
stuff out at Buffalo Creek Restaur-
ant, a place well-suited to this kind
of entertainment. It's not the Cellar
Door or anything like that—yet. It
will be. Small clubs are nice.

Bill Haymes and Steve Askins
were the musicians; Haymes plays
guitar and piano, Askins plays gui-
tar and mandolin. They're from the
Baltimore area; Askins is “house
musician” at the Fifteen Beloved in

The J, Geils Band “raunch” in Doremus, Picture by Robinson,

Timonium,

They have a versatility most per-
formers don't, at least around here,
in that they can play together ot
individually and sound good either
way,

Haymes played a nice medley of
Beatles songs on the piano, with
some very smooth bridging. He's
easy-going when he plays, and there
Was & Nice rapport established with
the audience very quickly. He and
Askins did a superb set of Dylan
songs on Saturday night, including
a really fine rendition of “You Ain't
Goin’ Nowhere,” the best version
I've heard since the Byrds did it on

Blue Gridders Score Quickly,
Hold On For Homecoming Win

By LEWIS HIXSON

An emotionally high General
team jumped into an early 21 to 0
first quarter lead, and then coasted
the rest of the way to upend Se-
wanee in last Saturday’s homecom-
ing game. They used the one-two
punch of Tom Van Ambungh and
Jim Farrar in a devastating first half
ground game which almost blew
the opponents out of the stadium.

The offensive line was splendid as
they opened holes that you could
have driven trucks through, With
this type of blocking, Van Am-
burgh and Farrar had no problem
picking up as much as 10 to 20
yards a shot during the first half.

The Generals scored the first
three times they touched the ball.
Their first came following the open-
ing kickoff with a 70 yard drive that
consumed 9 plays. The score came
when Van Amburgh broke into the
open after a quick hitter off left
tackle for 20 yards and the touch-
down. Chase made the point after
good and the Blue had jumped into
an early 7-0 lead.

Unable to move, Sewanee was
forced to punt to the Generals, who
set up shop at their own 33, This
time, it was almost a total replay
of the first series. Fluharty drove
the team 67 yards completely on
the ground. Once again, the drive
took nine plays. Once again, Van
Amburgh hit the left side of the
line, and went in from the 25,
Chase’s PAT was good, and the
scoreboard showed a 14 point Blue
lead,

However, there were still six
minutes left in the quarter and the
Generals were to make the most of
them. On the second play from

scrimmage, Perry Sowell stepped in
front of a Tipps pass and made
the interception at the Sewanee
41 yard line.

Once again, it took nine plays to
get into the end zone. The touch-
down came on a 7 yard blast up
the middle by Jim Farrar. Chase
once aagin converted to make it 21
to 0 at the end of the first quarter.
In the second quarter both teams
exchanged touchdowns. The Gen-
erals’ came on a 12 yard pass from
Fluharty to Mark Lane, and Se-
wanee’s on a 58 yard pass from
Tipps to Watson, Both teams made
their conversions good, and the half-
time score was W&L 28, Sewanee
7

The Generals’ performance in the
first half was by no means an in-
dication of how they were to do in
the second half. Sewanee stormed
back on the passing of Tipps. That
was accompanied by a_ noticable
W&L letdown, which made a game
of it. Had it not been for a brilliant
run by Jim Farrar of 56 yards in
the third quarter for a T.D., it
would have been too cose for com-
fort. Sewanee scored three times in
the second half, but failed to con-
vert on any of their conversions,
Tipps threw for one and ran for
one, as he grabbed the momentum
for his own team, The other Se-
wanee score came on a I yard
plunge by Sims,

To really see just how close the
game ended, one must look at two
things. First of all, Sewanee failed
to convert on any of their extra
points during the second half. Also,
in the last drive of the game, they
reached the General 3 yard line,
before Tipps fumbled and Bill Wal-

lace recovered for the Blue.

In looking back over the season,
one must wonder at the consistency
of the Blue. This game seemed very
simlar to the way they’ve played the
whole season, Like in the first half,
the Blue looked unbeatable as they
did against Westminster and Tow-
son State. Then again, the second
half is representative of their games
against Centre and Western Mary-
land, in which emotional letdowns
occurred,

Van Amburgh and Farrar both
had excellent games as they rushed
for 187 and 140 yards respectvely,
with two touchdowns apiece, Conrad
punted for a 45.8 yard average and
kept Sewanee out of good field posi-
tion,

Aside from individual standouts,
the defense played a very sound
football game in the first half, but
seemed to lack enthusiasm during
the second half. Next week the Blue
have an important conference game
with Southwestern in Memphis, and
will need all the consistency they
can get.

Booters Slip By Randolph-Macon, 3-2,
Kick VMI 9-1; Hope For Tourney Bid

By PAUL CAVALIERE
AND RICH KOCH

This past week was a most re-
warding one for the Washington and
Lee soccer team, which edged Ran-
dolph-Macon 3-2 and stomped VMI
9-1. The victory over Randolph-
Macon was especially satisfying to
the Blue, for the Hornets were rank-
ed second in the state behind Madi-
son College.

Having anxiously awaited this
chance to play Randolph-Macon,
the Generals were really psyched
by gametime, and jumped out to a
two goal lead in the first half. W&L
captain Meade Kampfmueller al-
lied the first score on a fine shot
from directly in front of the Hor-
net goal. With just seconds remain-
ing in the half, right-inside Jim Fox
scored with an assist by right-wing
Mike Schaeffer.

In the second half it appeared
that the soccer jinx had come once
again to haunt the Generals, This
contest marked the third time al-
ready in the 1972 soccer season that
Washington and Lee had registered
a two goal lead, only to see the op-
posing team tie the game. The sec-
ond half surge by Randolph-Macon
sent the game into overtime.

With thirty seconds left in the
first of two required overtime per-
iods, W&L’s Mike Schaeffer blasted
the deciding shot into the Hornet
net. The Blue wasted the second
five minute period in a kicking duel
with the frustrated Hornet squad.

The team virtually exploded with
happiness at game's end. A very
proud Coach Lyles termed the vic-
tory “the best team effort I have
seen in my entire fourteen years at
Washington and Lee.” The 110%
Award, normally given to outstand-
ing individuals after a game, was
conferred on the entire team, for the
exceptional group effort it displayed.

In W&L’s version of the Virginia
Campaign, the next battle was with
VMI, and when the rout was com-
plete, the Keydets left the field
thinking New Market was a picnic
when compared with this encounter
with the Washington and Lee Blue.
The Generals wasted no time. Jun-
ior Bill Spofford was the big gun,
scoring two of his three goals early
in the first half. Schaeffer added an-
other before VMI made their charge.
The rally was repulsed after the
Keydets had gained but one score,
and Kampfmueller sealed VMI's

fate with another goal shortly be-
fore the period ended,

Jim Fox opened the scoring bar-
rage in the second half with two
very quick goals. After that, with
the score at 6-1, Coach Lyles un-
loaded the bench, with everyone
getting a chance to play. For near-
ly twenty-five minutes the Blue sub-
stitutes skirmished with the Keydets,
until the varsity re-entered the game
with ten minutes remaining. Again
the Generals seized the initiative.
Spofford, Kampfmueller, and Chip
Tompkins each collected goals be-
fore the match ended. After the
game, Coach Lyles presented the
110% Award to Bill Spofford, who
did an outstanding job tending the
VMI goal.

The Generals are now ranked
fifth in the East Coast circuit of
the NCAA College Division stand-
ings. To qualify for the NCAA tour-
nament, W&L must move up to the
fourth spot or better. The Blue get
a chance to improve their position
on November 4th as they take on
nationally-ranked Navy. Hopefully
the Generals will not let the Mid-
shipmen stand between them and a
coveted berth in the NCAA tourna-
ment.

At any rate, J. Geils and his band
have a reputation for rocking, and
they do. To pick out particular songs
and talk about them in this case
would be silly, because everything
they play is equally explosive.

Their repertoire, like their style,
is somewhat limited from a musical
standpoint, but they have never
claimed to be anything more than a
shitkicking rock'n'roll band. They
haev full right to make that claim.
J. Geils and his work on that guitar
left litthke doubt as to his source of
inspiration,

Magic Dick, the harmonica play-
er, is an equally insane maniac with
perma-durable lips. Peter Wolf, the
vocalist, is no Mick Jagger, but he’s
got his thing and he does it. The
other 3 men in the band—drums,
bass, and keyboards—serve as the
underlying rhythm section,

with monotonous exultation” an ap-
pendage pulled from behind a grinn-
ing codpiece, and Achilles appear-
ing “in drag” (apparently having left
the transvestite ball in progress in
his tent). Barton's bias reminds us
that “tis mad idolatry to make the
service greater than the god”, es-

pecially if the god is Amor.
Among recent North American
productions three deserve passing
notice either for success or excess.
In the centennial year of the Civil
War, the Stratford (Conn.) reper-
tory company offered Troilus in
modern dress as the War Between
the States rather than city-states, At
least these Myrmidons appeared in
Union suits! The 1963 Stratford
(Ontario) rendition effectively con-
trasted the two camps through cos-
tume: the more warlike Greeks were
clad in sombre grays and browns
whereas the sybaritic Trojans don-
ned “salacioussly-cut tunics of hot
orange and white in feminine
pleats.” Finally, in 1965, Joseph
Papp’s Central Park Troilus, bit-
terly anti-heroic in tone, centered
on the scurrilous railings of a lame,
hunchbacked Thersites, played for
maximum misanthropy by Joseph
Bova. Frank Schofield as Pandarus
