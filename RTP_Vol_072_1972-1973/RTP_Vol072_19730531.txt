Vol. LXXII

A well-known director and pro-
ducer, the Episcopal bishop of
Arkansas, and a prominent civic
and cultural leader in Lexington
received honorary degrees from

Washington and Lee University
at commencement exercises
Thursday.

The director is Fielder Cook,

whose television credits include
“The Homecoming,” “The Price”
and “Harvey.” The bishop is Cris-
toph Keller Jr., whose cathedral
became nationally known in the
1960s as a center of racial har-
mony. The Lexington community
leader is Miss Mary Monroe Pe-
nick, well-known in the fields of
music, teaching, conservation and
historic preservation.

The three honorary degrees—
Doctor of Fine Arts degrees to
Cook and Miss Penick, and the
Doctor of Divinity degree to Bish-
op Keller—were conferred during
commencement exercises, at
which undergraduate and law de-
grees were conferred on 419 W&L
students.

The ceremonies took place on
the historic Front Campus. By
long-standing tradition the speak-
er was the university president,
Robert E. R. Huntley. Also offer-
ing brief remarks was the student
body president, Robert O. Bren-
nan.

Cook is a 1947 graduate of
Washington and Lee, and Keller
is a 1939 graduate. Miss Penick is
a graduate of Hollins College and
the Juilliard School of Music.

“The Homecoming,” Cook's
award-winning production first
telecast at Christmastime in 1971,

"Those At Home Do Less’

was the basis for the highly suc-
cessful series “The Waltons.”
Cook directed Arthur Miller’s
“The Price” as well as “Teacher,
Teacher,” the sensitive and illumi-
nating story of a retarded child,
for the Hallmark Hall of Fame
Series.

In addition, he directed the tele-
vision revival of “Harvey” with
James Stewart and Helen Hayes,
also for Hallmark, and the 1966
musical special “Brigadoon.”

Cook was director of the Lux
Television Theatre, TV’s first re-
gularly scheduled dramatic series,
from 1950 to 1953, and from 1953
to 1956 produced and directed 18
programs a year for the Kraft
Television Theatre.

He also directed and produced
regular programs for the duPont
Show of the Week series, the
Philco and Goodyear Playhouses,
and Playhouse 90.

He has received several Emmy
awards, two Directors Guild pla-
ques, and numerous other awards
and nominations.

Mr. Cook is also the director of
seven motion pictures whose stars
include Sir John Gielgud, Ingrid
Bergman, Dame Edith Evans,
David Niven, Deborah Kerr, Jason
Robards and others.

He is a member of the board
of governors of the Academy of
Television Arts and Sciences as
well as vice president and board
member of the Directors Guild
of America.

City, Mich., initially entered busi-
ness after graduation from W&L
and service with the U.S. Marine

Why Spring Term?

By JESS REKVES

it sounds like more and more
people are asking “what is wrong
with Spring Term?” The past aca-
demic year marked W&L’s third
with its new curriculum
and calandar, A lot of people on
the ‘Hill’ still do not like some of
the changes that have been made
in the academic framework and
most of those never did, but it
would seem that the ranks of the
discontented are swelling.

The origins of Spring Term and
the new calendar go back to Dr.
Pusey's year as acting President
of the University. In 1966 he ap-
pointed a ten member faculty
committee to study the curricu-
lum of Washington and Lee. The
first chairman of the committee
was Dr. Roberts of the Biology
Department. Dr. Spencer led the
group through a second year of
study and Dr. DeVogt saw the
third vear of this committee end
with the acceptance of their pro-
posals on changes that should be
made in the curriculum

season

Iipiscopal Bishop Christoph

The committee was then allowed
to die its natural death, having
reorganized the curriculum, re-
quirements, organization and cal-
endar of the school.

After two years under the pre-
sent system President Huntley
decided that the committee should
be reinstituted to evaluate the
progress being made under the
new curriculum, The study group
was comprised of basically the
same group as the first time
around: Dr. Jarrett, Dr. Phillips,
Dr. Thompson, Dr, Buchanan, Dr.
Hodges, Mr. Stevenson, Dr. Du-
vall, Dr. Roberts, Dr. Spencer. The
chairman was still Dr. DeVogt.
The report of this group to the
President consisted primarily of
the results of a faculty poll on
the new curriculum,

Response to the questionnaire
submitted to President Huntley
during the last Winter Term was,
if anyhing, better than was expec-
ed, The changes in the curriculum
instituted in the past few years

Keller

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, MAY 31, 1973

Director of TV, Bishop,
Civic Leader Honored

Corps during World War II,

In 1955, however, he resigned
from his positions as executive
vice president of Murphy Oil Co.
and president of Deltic Farm &
Timber Co. to answer a late call
to the ministry. He received his
vocational education at General
Theological Seminary in New
York and at the graduate school of
the University of the South. He
holds honorary degrees from both
institutions.

Ordained a priest in 1957, Mr.
Keller took his wife and six chil-
dren to the Ozark Mountains of
Arkansas, where he ministered to
three mission congregations.

In 1962 he was called to St.
Andrew's Cathedral in Jackson,
Miss. During his pastorate there
the church served as a reconcil-
ing influence in the community,
becoming nationally prominent
when participants in a so-called
“kneel in” were welcomed for the
first time in a Mississippi church.

He was elected bishop coadjutor
of the Diocese of Arkansas in
1967, and three years later he suc-
ceeded Bishop Robert R, Brown
as diocesan.

He serves on the board of theo-
logical education of the Episcopal
Chureh and on the governing
boards of the University of the
South (Sewanee), General Theo-
logical Seminary, and Al! Saints’
Episcopal School. He has also
been a trustee of Sweet Briar Col-
lege and Kent School.

Miss Penick has been organist
and music director at the Lexing-
ton Presbyterian Church since
1931. From 1940 until 1962 she
was supervisor of music in the
Lexington public school system,
and from 1951 to 1956 served on
the Hollins College board of trus-
tees.

In addition to Hollins and Juil-
liard, she has studied music at
Northwestern, Columbia and Yale
Universities, and in 1960 spent a
vear in France studying organ
and conducting under Nadia Bou-

langer.
In 1945 Miss Penick founded
the Rockbridge Concert-Theatre

Series, Lexington’s community
concert organization, on whose
board she continues to serve.

She holds two Algernon Sydney
Sullivan medals—one from Wash-

ington and Lee (1948) and one
from Hollins (1960). The award
recognizes excellence “in high

ideals of living, in spiritual quali.
tiles, and in generous and disinter-
ested service to others.”

Her father, Paul MecNee!l Pe
nick, Was a trustee of Washing
ton and Lee and its treasure!
from 1915 until 1940

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

   

OUTLOOK and REVIEW,
A Welcome To Freshmen

There are usually three purposes in printing an end-ol-the-
year edition of the Ring-tum Phi to mail to all incoming
freshmen: to let our advertisers wecome you to Washington
and Lee, to welcome you ourselves, and to offer a few words of
advice to the novice university man.

The first purpose can be seen as fulfilled by just paging
through the rest of this paper and noting all the space devoted
to advertising. The second purpose is easy enough to fulfill in
this editorial—we welcome you to Washington and Lee and
hope that you enjoy your stay here.

But it is the third purpose—to offer some advice —which
cannot be so easily fulfilled, It is difficult to try to be specific
in doling out little items of advice that will help the entire
incoming freshman class. But a few generalizations can be
made to at least help the typical freshman get into the academ-
ic and social swing of things.

Upon first arriving here in September, you will all be sub-
jected to that little week-long festivity known as orientation,
The Class of 1977 will be taken into the wild jungles of Na-
tural Bridge, where it will find little else to do other than
listen to the endless cavaleade of speeches about an equally
endless cavalcade of subjects.

There will be an almost irrestible urge in each freshman,
after about the first speech, to skip out on the rest of the
activities and spend his time more wisely sleeping in his
room. But believe it or not, all those speeches you hear do
have a purpose. Whether on the academic grandeur of the
school, or on its troubled Honor System, each speech, if fol-
lowed with a reasonable attentiveness, will aid the freshman in
his four years here, And be sure to remember any questions
which the speeches may raise in your mind, as the freshmen
dormitory counselors will be at Natural Bridge to answer any
questions and to perhaps give an insight into what to watch
out for at the university.

The Honor System will be the most important subject dis-
cussed at the orientation program. Many people believe that
\W&L’s present Honor System is dying. What next year's
student body government, the Executive Committee, will be
doing at orientation is to revitalize the Honor System in the
minds of the students at Washington and Lee. The Honor
System is still one of the most distinctive traits of this univer-
sity, and its effect wll still be far-reachng, as you will see
when someday a fellow student wll be asked to leave the uni-
versity after being convicted of an Honor Code violation.

\nother W&L institution besides orientation which you
will have to face is Rush. Although fraternties have been fad-
ing away slowly in relation to their social value to the univer-
sity, they are still an important part of W&L student life, as
about 60% of students are in fraternities.

Participating in Rush is an experience to be recommended
to each freshman. Even if you are not planning to join a frater-
nity, Rush still provides an excellent opportunity to meet
some upperclassmen and to get an idea of the social animal at
W&L. But be sure to view the world of fraternities as ob-
jectively as possible, keeping in mind the expanding role of
independent life at the university. Be sure to talk to some in-
dependents as well as to the fraternity boys, for a biased
opinion from both sides is better than a biased opinion from
only one side.

These little bits of advice will hopefully help to pull you
through the first few weeks here next fall untill you are able
to stand up for yourself and face each new deluge which you
will find constantly pounding you. Until then, we look for-
ward to seeing you in the fall and we hope these few prelimi-
nary words will be helpful to you in your first few days at
W&L.

Wanted: More Staff Members

Just for the record, you are most likely looking at the last
issue of the Ring-tum Phi to be printed in this general format.
Vlans are as yet incomplete, but we are anticipating major
change in this newspaper.

In recent years, the Phi has been experiencing the nation-
wide campus problem of student apathy, Interest in the paper,
both in reading it and in working for it, has declined sharply
in the last four years. In an attempt to counter this decline, we
of next year's staff will be trying to make the paper draw in-
terest from the student body,

To do that, we will need a large and competent staff. And
we cordially invite you to stop by the Phi office in Reid Hall if
vou feel you can be of service, The need for a newspaper like
the Phi at Washington and Lee is great, but the need for a
competent staff to put out an excellent paper at WA&L is even
greater.

Perhaps the first thing an in-
coming freshman would want to
know, arriving in a strange town
at an unfamiliar campus, is where
to purehase things—supplies,
books, furniture, clothes, etc.

WEL students, by and large,
maintain a good relationship with
the Lexington merchants. Most
restaurants and stores will take
student checks with no question.
Most of the clothing stores have
charge accounts which will allow
to send the bills home to Dad.

The campus center for mer-
chandise is, of course, the Uni-
versity Co-op. In this rather small
building, between the library and
the freshman dormitories, there
is a snack bar, bookstore, text-
book store, and a record store.
The snack bar and textbook sec-
tion are run by Mr. James Tolar
—and the Co-op is probably the
most popular spot in town for
students to eat breakfast and
lunch. Their prices are reasonable
(10 cent Cokes and 25 cent hot
dogs still survive here!) and it's
a central place for students to
meet. The Coop carries a com-
plete line of notebooks and sta-
tionery supplies, greeting cards,
Wé&L clothing and gifts, as well
as food,

Adjoining the snack bar is Betty
Munger’s Bookstere, Mrs. Mun-
ger's operation is distinct from
the textbook division, and is com-
prised of mostly paperback books.
Mrs. Munger selects her titles
with the student and faculty
ellentie in mind, and her store has
impressed many a campus visi-
tor. It is rare that a visiting poet,
scholar, or lecturer leaves W&L
before stocking up on books from
her shelves.

Dowentairs, the textbooks and
the record store are located. The

Co-op selis both new and used
editions of booke for all W&L
courses, so students have a choice

in price. The Co-op also buys back
used textbooks from students for
resale,

Rieh Johnson's
among the textbooks, is perhaps
the most sticceseful of the lot. He
has put one major record shop in
town out-of-yusiness with hie dis

record eatore,

also included at one time or an-
other.

Birch Society ‘Sans’ Mellhany;
Where Does It Go From Here?

By DOUG BURTON

“We don't want anyone to join
the John Birch Society who isn't
going to be a Bireher with a
capital B.” the voung man said
deftly rolling up the cord to the
slide projector.

Freshman Bill Mellhany had
given his first J.4.5. film atrip
on this campus in September of
1960, It was the firet of many
film strips that Melihany and co-
workers Jack Whipple and Wil-
liam Merrill would show during
their four years at thie Univer:
nity

\il three graduated this May,
leaving behind them a tradition
of Hireher activiem that the four
remaining dues paving members
will be hard pressed to continue

Mclihany was by far the lou
dest voice. Speaking in Lee Cha
pel on Moratorium day in Oete
ber 1960, Melihany was quoted by
the HRingtum Phi as saving “the

eountry’s troubles in the (Viet
pain ) war were ceaipaal hy a
Conspiracy between the United

States and the US.S.R.” He call-
ed then for a halt to the “con-
stant flow of aid and comfort to
our enemies.”

It was strange talk at a time
when campus activism Was on
the upswing. Harvard students
were on strike. A few months be-
fore student ad hee committees
had taken to the barricades,
in paris, Rome, and Berlin,
everywhere calling for a new
Marxist revolution. It was atill
chic to be radical, and Herbert
Marcuse Was enjoying unpre.
cedented popularity,

tut Melihany wae then laying
what he hoped would become the
groundwork for @ vigorous coun
terattack, That counterattack has
resulted in few conversions but
has indueed many radicals and
eonservatives alike to rethink
their positions

it is not unfair to say that Me
Ithany was himeelf a radical, for
he was as much a eritie of “the

not surprising, though; Walcott
was one of Ravi Shankar's first
Western students for sitar, and
Alla Rakha’s for tabla. The tabla,
rather like a bongo in size only,
provides a much more versatile
rvhthm base for the musie than
traps could, merely by virtue of
the different pitches of the drums
within the set. As he did with
Winter, Walcott uses a variety of
pereussion to “fill out” the round-
ness of his sound. Percussion is
much more than the thump-
thump-thump of so much other
musie around these days.

This is another one of those al-
bums which is at home wherever
you take it.

Two Athletic Captains Honored 2

Two-sport stars Don Kavenson
and Brandon Herbert have re-
ceived the top athletic awards at
Washington and Lee for 1973.

Itavenson, who captained both
the football and lacrosse teams
for the Generals, was named
W&L’s most valuable athlete. Her-
bert, captain of the soccer and
track squads, received the award
for spirit and sportsmanship,

Rob Lindsey of Easton, Md., a
starting defenseman on the W&L
team, was named the
Outstanding Freshman Athlete,

lacrosse

They received their awards
during Wé&L’'s annual Spring

Sports Barbecue, which winds up
the athletic year. In all, 183 mono-
grams and 186 participation certi-
ficates were presented to the 369
students who took part in inter-
collegiate athletics during the
year, That represents over 26 per
cent of the overall undergradu-
ate male student body of 1,402.
The 1972-73 athletic year was
one of the most successful in
W&L’'s history, with the 11 var-
sity sports posting an overall
record of 106 victories, 50 losses

Some faculty members feel that

ho wishes that the Spring Term

“Spring is the wrong time to start

omething new!”

Seniors, especially, do not want
to start a new term six weeks be-

would forward to a three
week vacation in Maine; not too
exciting or terribly stimulating,
but a nice, relaxing way to waste
some time, In the faculty ques-
tionnaire instructors were asked
to evaluate any programs in their
respective departments which
were unique to the Spring Term.
Thirty percent replied that they
had not participated in any such

As one member of the faculty
commented on his questionnaire;
“The worst thing about this six
weeks is that students feel con-
fident they can do less. Six weeks
term is of value to those who
study abroad. Those at home do
less.” The conditions which give
rise to this attitude must be nip-
ped in the bud by changing our
approach to the Spring Term, or
it might as well be shelved until
the W&L community can handle
