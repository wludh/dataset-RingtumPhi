Recruiting Funds Denied

By JOHN ZINK
The Student Recruitment Com-
mittee failed Monday night to pro-
cure funds from the Executive Com-

mittee to establish a “scholarship
weekend” for select high school
students applying to Washington

and Lee.

Larry Evans, chairman of the Stu-
dent Recruitment Committee, pres-
ented a plan to establish a scholar-
ship weekend aimed at a limited and
select group of applicants in an at-
tempt to have them enter Washing-
ton and Lee. Evans stated that these
students represent “a special inter
est group” to which the University
itself can not pay special attention
in recruiting.

Bill Merrill, EC vice-president,
pointed out to the EC members that
the Evans proposal would eat up
about one-half of the present bud-
get and that the money would have
io come out of the reserve fund
Bob Brennan, EC president, express-
ed his approval of the project. Bren-
nan “This project should be
tried on an experimental basis, not
to set a precedent.”

Law School representatives Henry
Jernigan said that the proposal was
a good idea but that this was the

said,

responsibility of the University and
no that of the students through
tie EC, Junior Mike Brittin voiced

his support of Evan's proposal and
suid, “This is a good time to have

more responsibility in getting a
more diverse student body.”

Rick Gray, disagreed, saying that
the students should not be required
to shoulder the responsibility. Ar-
cher Frierson said, “I think it is a
special interest and that is why I am
against it.” The EC voted six in
favor and five against; the motion
failed, needing a two-thirds major-
ity in order to carry.

In other business, Frank Porter,
president of the University Federa-
tion, was able to gain access to the
EC's funds for the support of his

organizations community — service
projects of the Winter Clothing

Drive and the Food for Needy Pro-
gram. Porter pointed out the great
need which exists in the surround-
ing community for group action such
as this. He explained that W&L stu
dents will give about $850 to the
clothing program while the IFC will
give $100 to the food program.
Porter requested that the EC give
$50 to be divided between these pro
The EC passed this request in
a resolution, Porter told the mem
bers that his group would be col
lecting from students in order to
buy clothes for the needy children
of Rockbridge County and to pay
for Thanksgiving baskets for area
families, Strong support was voiced
for these programs and it was urged
that the students do all that is pos
sible to help the successful comple

Drug Charges

morning at 9 am, and approved
capias warrants.

Arrests were made during the af-
ternoon by a squad comprised of
State, County, and City police.

Sisler said that undercover work
had been in progress for over a
year and acknowledged that the
Lexington arrests were “pretty much
the end of it.”

He said that at least two more
arrests had yet to be made. Bond
was set at $10,000 for the first
count and $1,000 for every addi-
tional account for each of those
arrested. The pre-trial hearing has
been set for December 6, at which

time the trial date will be deter-
mined,
Four state troopers posed as

“customers and friends” of the ac-
cused, The troopers were: T. S.
Savard, W. B. Taylor, T. J. Rose-
berry, and W. H. Fowle,

Penalties for drug convictions in
Virginia range from five to forty
years per count. Sisler said that simi-
lar charges in Roanoke led to “some
pretty steep sentences.”

Information on the arrests was
withheld throughout the night, and
the local sheriff's office denied ac-
cess to police records.

All the arrests were made in off-
campus apartments, and no univer-
sity buildings were entered by the
authorities. There were no indica-
tions that any students were involv-
ed in the undercover work,

University officials said that they
were not notified in advance of the
indictments and had no previous
knowledge of the operation. Lewis
G. John, Dean of Students, said the
university would “be of assistance
in any way we can,” but could not
provide either bond or counsel for
the arrested students.

THE RING-TUM PHI

   

OUTLOOK and REVIEW
Autonomy for the Law School

As was reported in our last issue, many law students be-
lieve they don’t have enough control over their own affairs.
This was the message carried to the Executive Committee
by law school representatives Jeff Twardy and Henry Jerni-
gan, and an investigation was set into motion to determine the
feasibility of granting the Law School greater autonomy.
While no specific demands were set forth, it is generally
thought that the eventual goal is separate administration by
the law students of their honor system and their student
government.

While the implications of this proposal are obviously mom-
entous, it surely must not come as a surprise to anyone who
has been around W&L for any length of time. The ties be-
tween the undergraduate students and the law students have
become fewer and fewer over the years; if complete autonomy
for the law school were to come in the near future, it would
be a mere formalization of a break which has been developing
for some time now.

With Dean Roy Steinheimer presiding, the character and
composition of the Washington and Lee School of Law has
been altered radically. No longer was Tucker Hall to be the
refuge of would-be lawyers straight from W&L and VMI.
Courses have become tougher, and admissions requirements
have become more stringent. The policy was deliberately aim-
ed to attract more students from other undergraduate in-
stitutions and to place Washington and Lee among the most
competitive law schools in the South.

While this may mean real progress for the Law School’s
reputation, it certainly has not brought the undergraduates and
law students closer together. On the contrary, since most of
the current law students are products of other colleges, they
cannot relate to the W&L experience—be it the social life or,
more important, the honor system.

In addition, several other factors have contributed to mak-
ing the alienation more acute: (a) an increasing percentage of
law students are married, (b) their average age seems to have
increased, widening the gap of years between the undergradu-
ates and the law students, and (c) there is a natural tendency
for students to consort with those in their own discipline.

The completion of the new Lewis complex, then, should
be icing on the cake. The law students will at that time become
physically isolated as well.

We are not assigning blame for this situation, Let’s face
it: plenty of law students are downright condescending toward
undergraduates and wouldn't have anything to do with them
under any circumstances. But, all things considered, their de-
sire to detach themselves from undergraduate affiliations in
understandable.

The question, therefore, is this: precisely how and to what
extent should this be accomplished? While redistribution of
student governmental powers would be essentially a proce-
dural matter, a transferal of honor system authority would
have crucial implications for the whole university.

‘To consider the first aspect, it is conceded that the operat-
ing budgets for both the undergraduate schools and the law
school are under the same umbrella. Also, the student body
tax, paid by law students and undergraduates alike, is handled
and distributed by the EC.

The claim has been made that the law students are getting
a bad deal for their money. It is true that out of the $17 tax,
only $1.40 goes specifically to law school projects (namely,
the Law News and the Student Bar Association). The re-
mainder, however, goes in large part to funding programs
which do, either directly or indirectly, benefit law students
(i.e., the Contact speaker symposium, the campus film pro-
uram, the University Theater productions—all free of admis-
sion for law students). The advantages of the undergraduates
and the law students being able to pool their resources for
these programs are clear, Considering, in addition, the por-
tion of the assessments that must go toward maintaining
several reserve funds, we are not persuaded that law students
are paying more than their fair share.

When we enter the realm of the honor system, we face a
stickier question, This has, after all, been the primary con-
cern of the current law student body. Polled by the EC a
few weeks ago, a whopping 75% believed the law school
should be able to administrate its own honor system; 62%
favored a graduated penalty for convictions.

And what has perhaps bothered the law students most of
all are the recent EC revisions aimed at eliminating the ad-
versary system from honor trials, 84% said they favored a
formal guarantee of due process.

Mr. Jernigan stated before the EC that the present system
“noses threats or ambiguity” towards law school students.
They are apprehensive about being judged before a pri
marily undergraduate body.

While we cannot see why a law student should feel “threat
ened” by an undergraduate’s decision in an honor trial, we do
acknowledge that there is some question as to whether or not
he is being tried before his peers, But in contemplating any
changes touching on the honor system, the EC must tread
very, very carefully,

There can never be two different stanadrds of honor on
this campus, Believe it or not, undergraduates do look to the
law students for an example of proper judgment. Were the
latter to abandon the present honor system for a weaker, dis
tilled version, the consequences could be disastrous for the
whole tradition of a trustful community at Washington and
Lee

W. PAT HINELY

Hot on the heels of the film
shown at the Lyric this past week,
entitled Fillmore, we have the album
of the same name, giving us the
music,

Here, at last, is what the average
East-coast rock fan has needed for
quite some time: an anthology, or
a better word would be sampler—
at any rate, contained within this
3-record set, along with all the Bill

Graham sentimental and _ historical
mush and jabbering, along with
some very nice packaging, is an

honest, thorough, and excellent as-

sortment of music that serves quite
well as an introduction and survey
to the music of San Francisco .

Al the big-name bands deliver
what they’re known for: first-class,
if not inspired music. Good enough
to get people dancing or else im-
mobilized in assorted states of con-
sciousness, The lesser-known “local”
Bay-area bands, such as Lamb,
Tower of Power, and Stoneguard,
also come off quite well.

The arrangement and sequencing
of the sides and inclusion of so much
talking detract from the album as a
musical work, but add to its histori-
cal perspective. This perspective, un-
fortunately, is pretty useless and
meaningless “back East,” unless you
hapened to be part of the Fillmore
West experience.

A Professor’s View Of The Arts

It was very pletasing to see so
much space given to the arts in last
Wednesday's edition—notice of a
Theater production, an editorial cri-
tical of architectural disasters on the
campus, and a report on the discus-
sion of art needs by the University
Council. | would like to make a few
comments on the editorial and the
University Council discussion.

The “neglect of the arts at Wash-
ington and Lee” was the subject dis-

cussed by the Council. There have
been pressing needs in art, music and
theater for some time but I do not
believe that “neglect” is he right
word, benign or otherwise. I feel
confident that the administration is
well aware of our “growing pains.”

I can remember that in 1948, the
year before art became a part of
the university program, the student
editor of the humor magazine (now
defunct) wrote an article ridiculing
the introduction of art to the cur-
riculum in an all-male college. He
predicted that students would be
swishing over the campus in smocks
and that students in the dormitories
would have model-mistresses in
every room. (I have not checked on
the dorms lately.)

He was expressing student and
perhaps even some faculty opposi-
tion to this new department which

 

 

 

Is P.E. Necessary?

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

There is one aspect of our great
institution that I was appalled at
1 first arrived here. Now, three
years later, it seems more ridicul-
ous than ever, | am referring to re-
quired Physical Education.

When people ask about WAL—
most are surprised to hear that we
are not coed, But when they hear
that | am taking volleyball or bad-
miton, they laugh, then ask, “What
university would still have required
P.E.!" The only answer that I can
give them is “a very backward,
conservative, Southern institution.”

As I understand it, this subject
has been raised about once a year
for the past few years in the Exe-
cutive Committee and University
Council meetings. What | cannot
understand is why these commit-
tees, Which are supposed to repre-
sent the student body, do not do
something about this matter.

Do these committees feel that the
majority of the students want re-
quired P. E.? | sincerely doubt it,
In fact, | predict that if a poll was
taken of the student body stating:
“Do you approve of required P, E.?"
over 3/4 o fthe students would vote
“NO.”

Again | ask why hasn't our stu-
dent government done something
about it? Of course there will be
“red tape” to go through—but if
our great E C did act on this issue,
I feel that it would gain more sup-
port and respect from the student
body because they finally did some-
thing worthwhile.

Now please do not misunderstand
me. I'm not complaining because
my coach is making me run a “burn
out” for my bowling class—or even
that he's telling us we must do
“homework” during ‘Thanksgiving

vacation—which most of his pupils
will not do, then lie about when
asked (thus hurting the honor sys-
tem).

I'm just trying to point out that,
as far as I can tell, the only reasons
we still have required P. EB. are:
1) The administration (who does not
have to go through this “Mickey
Mouse”) is behind it—and they just
built us a new gym, 2) the coaching
staff is numerous and wants to stay
powerful in the school bureaucracy,
and 3) our student government has
done little about this annoying
matter,

I honestly feel that nobody at the
age of 17 or older should be told
that he must take five P. BE, courses
for one credit or he will not gradu-
ate, What possible reason is there to
support required P. E.? It is as
dumb as freshman beanies.

Answer To Richardson

Mr. Richardson's letter of two
weeks ago lacks sufficient ground
in its protest of Mr. Faillace’s let-
ter for the following reasons: This
past Sunday, I worked at the Cock-
pit for seven and a half hours. When
I finished, I strolled up to the gym
and played two games of handball;
then I ran a mile and a few sprints.
Weary from the day's toils and
games, | descended four stories, only
to find that the saunas were closed,

Due to the fact that humans, by
their nature, consider themselves to
be above all else I find the issue of
the regulations on sauna use to be
very pertinent to the individuals of
the Washington and Lee community,
Finally, | view Mr. Richardson's
ideas as being high-flown and as
representative of overkill on the en-
fife meatier

P. B. Howe °73

he deemed trivial. Now we have
students demanding more art and
professors of Law and English urg-
ing that our needs be met. This is
quite a change but it did not happen
“overnight.” Twenty-three years of
hard work are involved. One might
as well say that the rocket to the
moon happened instantly.

As far as neglect is concerned I
can remember when art history lec-
tures were given in a cement-walled
room in the library basement. This
room was nicknamed “The Egyp-
tian Tea Room” due to the old
drapes hung from the ceiling to re-
duce the third echo. The studio was
a small room on the third floor of
Reid Hall.

We had 600 slides to work with
instead of our present collection of
15,500, There was no budget and
exhibitions had to be borrowed from
friends—called for and returned.
Except for one course taught by a
former professor it was a one man
department and that man taught
three lecture courses in the morn-
ing, studio in the afternoons, did all
the exhibitions and all the office
work with no secretary.

Then came duPont Hall—that
“Mock Colonade at it’s very worst.”
DuPont Hall was made possible by
an initial gift from the family of a
student who wanted to help improve
the art situation. With this initial
gift the Board of Trustees decided
to add to the gift and build a $350,-
000 Fine Arts Building.

This decision was an embarrass-
ment as many older departments
had been waiting years for better
space, and the 60 or so art students
would have rattled around in sur-
plus space. The dean and I agreed
that the best solution was to “give”
part of the building to other acade-
mic classes and retain the rear half
for art. This made it possible to
hide the “modern” building, which
art needed, with a conventional fac-
ade facing the campus as a truly
modern structure was not visably
acceptable.

This generosity almost resulted in
disaster as a new building commit-
tee, without our representation, was
appointed and this committee came
up with the lovely idea of a square
“collegiate colonial” structure and
relegated art to the attic and base-
ment. Needless to say this was not
acceptable to art and there were
some heated words,

The final result was duPont Hall,
a bastard building but functional in
it’s studio, gallery and auditorium.
(Poor man’s Frank Lloyd Wright in
the back and just plain Mary Ann
in front.) It was not long before the
influx of students made us question
our wisdom in “giving away” need-
ed space,

Returning to the idea of “over-
night” growth of the Art Depart-
ment, this seems like a logical con-
clusion until it is recognized that
for some years a strict limit had

“Apathy” has been a common
charge leveled at Washington and
Lee students, particularly in the
realm of their own campus affairs.
Bob Wilson, thinks that many stu-
dents with the most potential are re-
maining, sadly, uninvolved. Many
of them, he says, were those disil-
lusioned with W&L in part when
English instructor Henry Sloss was
denied tenure last year. Below, he
offers an outlook on this dilemma.

—Fd.

By BOB WILSON

Henry Sloss is gone, And most
people around W&L are probably
glad of it. This essay is not so much
for them as for those who believed
in him and miss him as I do, For
although it was not you who believ-
ed in him that felt threatened by
him, it was to you, to us, that he
directed his most severe criticism,
and it is about this that I write.

Although Mr, Sloss used to, |
think, always try to see the best in
any person or situation, he had
harsh words for what he described
as the ‘Great American Voyeur’
who is pleased to consider himself
somehow removed from some situa-
tion in which he is really involved.
You cannot be in a situation and not
in a situation, he'd say.

For example, you cannot be at
Washington and Lee and not be at
Washington and Lee. You cannot,
not merely because it is logically
impossible, but because you and
your life and what you can do for
those around you is too important
for you to sit back and detachedly
observe it, Even if what is going on
at W&L or wherever you find your-
self does not seem important to you,
you cannot merely observe a com-
munity of which you are a part,
but must make something of it.

What does that have to do with
us, me and those of you that cared
about what Mr. Sloss had to say?
He would never come right out and
tell us, would he? No, and the rea-
son he would not is he thought it
wrong to tell others how to live

their lives, to give them an ‘action
program’ as he would call it. In-
stead he objectively presented us
with a sketch of what he thought
was true, Mr. Sloss would never try
to make a story out of the truth.
This, he thought, would be using
knowledge as a source of power
over others, and that he would not
do,

Knowing less, | am not nearly as
humble as Mr. Sloss. I hate to show
that I learned poorly, but I think 1
see what the ‘Voyeur’ had (has) to
do with us, and I’m going to tell
you about it. First, a short sketch of
my own:

—a group of people at W&L,
hundreds maybe, who feel terribly
out of place here, who think there
might be something wrong not only
with the average W&L stud, but
with much about campus life; they
want to dissociate themselves from
the studs and this environment; they
live ‘in the country’ or an apart-
ment in town and speak contemptu-
ously of ‘the others’ with whom they
sce themselves as having no rela-
tion—

Familiar? It is to me. It is of
us that I think Mr, Sloss was think-
ing when he spoke. We are wrong.
We cannot be at Washington and
Lee and not be at Washington and
Lee. If we think we can sit back
and smoke dope and say how screw-
ed up this campus is without say-
ing also how screwed up we are,
we are quite wrong.

It is sad, too, Sad for W&L and
sad for us, Among us are, I think,
the most imaginative people at
W&L. We are the people who have
the most potential for making this a
good place to be.

And what do we do but sit back
and let ‘the others’ run the place?
You may not think so, but the fac-
ulty and administration have done a
lot to let students control their lives
here, not only socially but acade-
mically and aristically, They have
set up ways for students to work for
what they want. For example, stu-
dents are members of faculty com-
mittees now, like the curriculum
committee which decides which
courses will be offered to you. Do
you know what happens? Invari-
ably the student on the committee
turns out to be more conservative
than the faculty members. That is
because most of the really enlight-
ened students are too haughty to
get involved,

Last year there was a_ student
here named Don Marshall, who had
a rather low opinion of W&L, For
a while he muttered under his
breath and thought about transfer-
ing, but then he hit upon an idea
which would make his life here and
life in general at W&L a little more
bearable, He decided to become edi-
tor of the Calyx and create the first
artistic and interesting yearbook
that we have ever had. And he did.
He was just one person though, and
already what he has done has been
discredited by ‘the others’ who are
using their influence to see that it
doesn’t happen again. It probably
won't unless someone else steps
forward,

Everyone can't be editor of the
Calyx of course, but almost anyone
can. | am editor of the Ariel this
year, and do you know why? (Be-
cause the publications board decided
that | would be the most brilliant

editor of all those who asked for
the job? Hardly.) Because | was the
only one to apply. Surprising? Well
only one person applied for every
position on any of the publications
and they became this year’s editors.
This is not to say that they were
not the most qualified people for
the job,

You only need to look and it will
be clear that there is a lot that can
be done, and you can do it as well
or better than it is being done now.
Ask Ken Lane or Mr. Pellicciaro
what you can do. They have lots of
good ideas,

Everyone knows that you have
another choice besides loving or
leaving a place where you find your-
self. You can also fix it. Washington
and Lee needs fixing. If you are
here at W&L, you cannot not be
here. Mr. Sloss knew it. He told us,
Now we should act.

The Supreme Tortures
Of The 8:00 a.m. Class

By CHIP MARTIN

Washington and Lee's formal
statement of institutional philosophy
is: “Fundamental to all other as-
pirations of Washington and Lee
University is the pursuit of its edu-
cational purpose in a climate of
learning that stresses the importance
of the individual, his personal honor
and integrity, his harmonious rela-
tionship with his fellowman, and his
responsibility to serve society
through the productivity of his
training and his talent.”

True, the University does stress
the importance of the individual,
his personal honor and so on, but
does it always provide “a climate of
learning?” No, it does not. The
notorious Period A, beginning at
8:00 a.m., is far from this “climate
of learning.”

During his four year stay at the
University, the average student is
more than likely—unless he is ex-
tremely lucky—to encounter the in-
humane experience of the 8:00 a.m.
class. He will get up as late as pos-
sible, eat whatever he can in the
five minutes before class, and pull
himself up the hill.

Once in class, the typical student
will be alert and attentive, right?
Wrong. The typical student, we
shall call him Joe Typical for lack
of a better name, is awake, but not
really. Joe’s body is in class, but his
mind is back in bed. He can see the
professor's lips move, but he doesn't
hear them.

Soon Joe is completely gone.
After Joe's name has been called a
number of times, he realizes that
the question is being directed toward
him. The heat is on, Fumbling,
coughing and stalling for time, Joe

 

searches his numbed mind for an
answer,

Sometimes he gets lucky and an-
swers correctly. The heat is off and
so is Joe’s mind. If he answers in-
correctly, Joe gets nervous and at-
tempts to “tune in” to the discus-
sion, But it is all futile. Joe emerges
at 8:50 a.m. having learned very
little.

Not only does Joe learn very lit-
tle in Period A, but he has to pay
just as much for it as a later class in
which he learns much more, Joe
shells out $1,150.00 per semester
for his tuition, Each academic course
costs him approximately $287.00.
Can a course given to a sleepy stu-
dent at 8:00 a.m. be worth as much
as a course taught in the late morn-
ing or afternoon when he is more
attentive?

If 8:00 a.m. clases are so unpro-
ductive, why, then, do they exist?
William Watt, the Dean of the Col-
lege, gives one good reason: There
is a limited amount of classroom
space which necessitates an extra
period to accommodate all students.
According to Dean Watt, the faculty
voted a few years back to have
classes at 8:00 am. He further
states that as far as he can see,
there is no dissent among the fac-
ulty concerning 8:00 a.m. classes
and if there is, he would be happy
to hear from them.

Ah, but there is dissent. In a ran-
dom survey of ten professors, seven
voiced displeasure over Period A.
The words of one dissenting profes-
sor aptly sum up the whole: “I dis-
like them not necessarily for my-

self, but because students are at
about 65% capacity.”

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

 

Steve Fluharty was under great pressure from the Denison Redmen. Coach Leslie thought that the Blue’s
last two games would be their toughest. “After last Saturday, it loks like I was right.”

    
 

RING-TUM PHI

The combination of the number
52 and the color red meant victory
for two football teams in Lexington
this past weekend. On Friday the
Lexington High beat  arch-rival
Parry McClure 52-0. On Saturday
the Big RED from Denison Univer-
sity invaded Big Lex and beat the
Washington and Lee Generals in a
BIG way, the final score being 52-

The game was a case of one team
simply outclassing the other. Deni-
son was bigger, faster, stronger, and
on the whole better than the Gen-
erals. Led by senior running back
Ed Exler, Denison’s offense picked
up 419 yards in total offense to the
Generals 255 yards. Another statistic
that tells the story of the game is
that Denison had 173 return yards
(runbacks of punts, interceptions,
and fumbles) to W&L’s 29, Many of
Denison’s yards were picked up by
Fed Guylas. All he did was return
three punts for 111 yards and inter-
cept two passes for another 56 yards.
His play alone helped set up 23 of
Denison’s points,

The only thing W&L won all day
was the coin toss. After taking the
opening kickoff the Generals were
forced to punt. Enter Mr. Guylas,
He took Chappy Conrad's punt at
his own 10 and returned it 60 yards
to the W&L 30. Six plays later Jim
Bailey kicked a 32 yard field goal to
give Denison the lead for good.

The Generals got the ball back
but were again forced to punt....
Guylas again gave the Big Red ex-
cellent field position, returning this
punt 44 yards to the W&L 15. Exler
then scored from the one, and the

Blue Sees Red In 52-22 Loss

conversion made it 10-0. He later
added three more scores, and in the
process upped his career rushing
total to 3954 yards, a new Ohio
Conference Record.

For the Generals it was simply a
day where nothing went right. Ear-
lier in the week fullback Jim Far-
rar, Who was doubtful anyhow due
to a jammed thumb, suffered a rup-
tured appendix. Also missing was de-
fensive lineman Arch Christian, who
had an ankle injury, Enough said
for the injury list. Back to the game,

It just wasn’t the Generals’ day.
Steve Fluharty did throw a_ touch-
down pass to Chappy Conrad, but it
was obvious that Flu didn’t have it
as he had four aerials picked off.

Coach Buck Leslie inserted Lewis
Powell in the third quarter, Powell
moved the team well, but it was too
late, Under his direction W&L scor-
ed twice, on a 37 yard run by Mer-
cer West and a 6 yard scoring pass
from Powell to Conrad.

This week the Generals play their
season finale against Washington
University. Gametime is 2:00 P.M.
at Wilson Field.

Football Cards Draw
Local Betting Money

By TOM HONAKER

Wednesday afternoons in the Fall
wing a diverse string of emotions
rom many Washington and Lee
tudents and Lexington residents. At
his time, some are receiving their
‘ightful remuneration for a job well
lone; while others sit in utter self-
lisdain, realizing the sloppy per-
‘ormance turned in the week be-
‘ore. All who aren't utterly discour-
iged look forward to the weekend
ind the moment the scores come
across the air.

On Wednesday afternoon the
‘runners” come to Lexington. These
semi-delivery boys bring the money
‘or the previous week’s winners and
cards for the coming week's specu-
ator,

You would be surprised at the
number of people playing these “for
amusement only” cards—not only in
college towns, but in thriving met-
ropolitan areas, cards can be pro-
cured. The usual places to find
these cards are in country clubs,
bars, and general places of pleasure.
However, in many cases, they are
brought around to laborers at work,
Cards aren't only for the executive
type. At home, | played my cards
at a used miner’s clothing shop with
a toothless wonder named Nick.
Nick would bet his welfare money in
hopes of receiving some extra booze
money. He would hit at least 80%
of the time.

In case you're wondering about
the legality of these little gems, you
might be interested to know that it
is the location of the printing and
the consequent distribution of the
cards that determine their relative
acceptability by the legal authority.

If the card is printed in Virginia,
and doesn’t leave the state, it will
be a rarity for the state to do any-
thing more than frown on_ this.
However, an immediate crackdown
can be expected for cards becoming
interstate commerce. These cards
are bought relatively out in the
open, and it’s not unusual to see
many people of high legal and poli-
tical office with three hot bets for
Saturday. In fact the Washington
Post carried two articles on foot-
ball cards and bookies in their previ-
ous issues this fall.

There is no iron-clad rule that
can help you pick a winner on a
card, The minimum amount of
teams that can be picked is three,
and the maximum is ten, There are
a few pointers that seem to hold
favor with all successful prognosti-
cators. The first and by far the most
important of these is to be well in-
formed on your subject. Know which
team is home, look up last year’s
score, and see what each team did
the previous week. You can sub-
scribe to a publication that will not
only itemize scores and home teams,

but go into minute details of ex-
pected weather, team injuries, team
morale and unbelievable miscellane-
ous items. One such item was print-
ed before this year’s U.Va.-W.Va.
game, The publication stated “West
Virginia is definitely not a good
choice this week due to the brain
surgery of Quarterback Bernie Ga-
liffa’s wife. The mental condition of
Galiffa is at best unstable due to his
wife’s condition. When he’s hot, so
are the Mountaineers. He’s not, so
take U.Va.” The following Satur-
day in Charlottesville, Galiffa threw
for 377 yards as W.Va. romped
over U.Va, 48-10.

Secondly, never bet against your-
self on two or more different cards.
In the same light, don’t bet on the
same team too many times on diff-
erent cards, Finally, remember that
it is highly dangerous to bet on a
team about which you feel any
strong emotions. These feelings can
distort your objective view of the
game and you will pay in dollars.

It is hard to generalize about
which teams to take, and they do
differ from year to year. This year
the pros seem to be erratic and hard
to pick, Colleges seem to be easier,
but there are surprises in those
ranks, too, Usually anyone well-in-
formed could come out a big win-
ner from the Ivies, but that is not so
this year. My father used to play
Dartmouth every week and he very
rarely lost—they constantly beat
their point spread. But the bettor’s
perrenial favorites Dartmouth and
Yale lost on the card this week, and
other teams in other sections must
be found. It seems the best picks are
the big point spreads from the Mid-
west and West. Iowa State may re-
place Dartmouth as the prognosti-
cator’s favorite. It's a rare occasion
that a team like Nebraska will make
the card because they will casily
beat the point spread, but in the
same light, I've never seen V.M.1.
on a card either.

Football cards can be most en-
joyable and very profitable. If you're
not too tense and can wait for Sat-
urday’s score, it can be a gratifying
experience to see how well you've
done. Your performance will be a
mixture of luck and skill. Some
hunches win and some of the most
well planned and researched picks
fail. Only Wednesday afternoon and
the “runner” will tell.

Football Contest Winners!
Paul Holland has won last week's
football contest and will receive

Soccer Season Ends In Win

By PAUL CAVALIERE

The Washington and Lee soccer
team closed its 1972 season Thurs-
day with a 4-1 victory over VPI.
The win boosted the team’s final re-
cord to 6-2-2, but was small con-
solation for the generally disappoint-
ing year the Blue felt they had. In
the words of Coach Lyles, “This
year is our year. All we have to do
is just put it together,”

W&L just could not “put it to-
gether” when it most counted, The
1-0 loss to Madison College was the
Generals’ crucial set-back; it en-
abled Madison to qualify for three
post-season tournaments.

Although dissatisfied with their ex-
clusion from the post-season con-
tests, the Blue can be justifiably
proud of their respectable and hard-
earned winning season. Many times
during the season the Generals ex-
hibited the traits of a true cham-
pionship team, At these times the
Generals would have been more
than a match for any soccer squad
in the region.

In the Virginia Tech game, W&L
displayed these characteristics, but
not until after they had played over
an hour of mediocre soccer, VPI

was leading 1-0 when the Generals
finally caught up with their poten-
tial and started really playing soccer,
In a span of four minutes the Blue
erupted for four goals, while their
goalie Jeff Baum checked the Gob-
blers with excellent goal-tending.
Mike Schaeffer, John Buckley, Jim
Fox, and Cleve McGee each tallied
a score, as the Generals finished the
season in a small blaze of glory.
Five Generals have been nomi-
nated for All-Conference honors:
linemen Meade Kampfmueller, Mike
Schaeffer, Jim Fox, and backs Rolf
Piranian and Barclay Armstrong.

Already the Generals are looking
forward to the 1973 season, and all
the present indications point to a
bright future for W&L soccer. Next
year’s captains have already been
selected, The new team leaders are
Rolf Piranian and Bill Spofford.
The team will lose only three start-
ers to graduation, and there is a
wealth of freshman and sophomores
ready to fill the vacated positions,
If the Blue can reap a rich harvest
of entering freshmen, and more im-
portantly, coordinate their talents
and resources into a powerful soc-
cer unit, the 1973 season could well
be the Generals’ year to shine.

Junkin Writes On Arts Situation

been placed on the number of stu-
dents admitted. Five years ago all
but one art course was closed be-
fore the end of the spring registra-
tion. The last two years the courses
have been open to all so it looks
like a sudden explosion.

Neither plan is very fair. Closing
the course means many students are
turned away. Opening the course is
often unfair to the teacher. To have
47 students in a sculpture studio
suitable for about 17 is not satisfac-
tory, Adding another studio section
means adding 9 hours, not 3, to the
teaching load.

Yes, there are pressing needs.
Studio space, lecture rooms for the
Cheater, or a new Theater and other
expansion. This needed space is pe-

culiar space in that studios need
light, accoustics need to be consider-
ed in areas for music and the theat-
er.

Being optimistic | believe these
needs will be met, but I do not ad-
vise Washington and Lee to have a
single large art center building, as
suggested at the Council meeting,
for several reasons. First, it might
be a long time in coming as it would
cost several million dollars. Sec-
ondly, there would be a_ conflict
over space between art, music and
theater. The history of most com-
bined buildings is for much com-
promise in space with the strongest
department taking over,

Thirdly, it is good to have the arts
scattered over the campus as in this
way more students will make con-
tact. An off-campus Fine Arts Cen-
ter in isolated splendor sounds good
but would not be as effective as du-
Pont where students from other de-
partments come in contact with the
art exhibitions and become interest-
ed,

In conclusion | firmly believe that
the needs of Art, if not the Theater,
can be met in the near future at a
reasonable cost and I expect some
thinking has been done along these
lines,

not getting enough sleep”? At W&L
it is very difficult to get to bed be-
fore 1:00 a.m. Road trips, pinball,
and, believe it or not, studies have
a way of keeping Joe up. Yes, this is
a fault, but it is not going to change
Joe.

The 8:00 a.m. class is unpopular
with students and faculty alike;
hence, a call for action. The faculty
should be well aware that the stu-
dents will stand behind them if they
choose to abolish the 8:00 a.m.
class. And, faculty, your superior,
Dean Watt, has even stated that he
would be receptive to your views.
The next regular faculty meeting is
scheduled for December 4. There is
sufficient time for you faculty mem-
bers to talk among yourselves, and
if you now find yourselves against
8:00 awm. classes, then move to
abolish them.

Meanwhile, all Joe Typical can
do is continue to endure the bar-
barity of the 8:00 a.m. class and to

voice his dissent.

an added embellishment. Without a
doubt, this is the best 9 minutes on
the album,

Side 6 (welcome to side 6) is the
final night jam with Taj Mahal, El-
vin Bishop, and Boz Scaggs, along
with various members of several
bands playing and “splitting” as they
wished. The whole side is some of
the best spontaneous music ever
captured on recording tape. Taj
Mahal shows himself to be refined,
even in his raspy technique. Scaggs
and Bishop are both first-rate gui-
tarists in their own right, and like
the old saying goes, two heads are
better than one, It’s true.

The only major Bay-area band
not included in this set is the Jeffer-
son Airplane, but the Hot Tuna
rendition of “Keep Your Lamps
Trimmed and Burning” represents
those musicians and their general di-
rection quite well. The Chicano
bands, Santana and Malo, are al-
most explosive. The Grateful Dead,
well, they're the Grateful Dead.

Despite the commercialization in-
herent in any Bill Graham enter-
prise, the music makes this set a
worthwhile investment for anyone
who wants to get a good picture of
the overall Amerikan musical scene.
It’s worth listening to.

dual meets to 9-1,

Last Saturday, W&L’s most suc
cessful Cross-Country team ever tra-
veled to Wheaton, Ill. to participate
in the national college division
chamionship meet. The Generals, to
say the least, found the calibre of
competition high. Super-soph Stu
Nibley finished only 125th in the
field of 450 runners. Other finishers
for the Blue were freshman Jim
McMenamin 214th, Bill Kalal 280th,
Mike Burns 307th, and Bill Garri-
son 311th. The Generals placed 47th
among 72 teams.

This season was a great one, Be
sides the 9-1 record, the Blue also
brought a College Athletic Confer-
ence Championship to Lexington,
and garnered a second place finish in
the state meet. Led by captains Bill
Kalal and Bob Sherwood, and paced
by Stu Nibley, the Generals were a
good combination of youth and ex-

perience. Much of their success was
attributable to the fine crop. of
freshmen, who were led by Jim

McMenamin, Bike Burns, and Bill
Garrison. The future looks bright,
says Coach Miller. Most of this
year’s squad will be returning.
