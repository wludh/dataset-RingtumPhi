Fallon dies at 56

BY KEITH GRANT
Phi Staff Writer

Gary Fallon, Washington &
Lee’s head football coach since
1978, died suddenly Saturday
morning at his Lexington home.
The cause of death was an appar-
ent heart attack, according to a
source close to the family. He
was 56 years old.

Fallon, W&L’s winningest
football coach, came to Wash-
ington & Lee in 1978, a decade
after the Generals’ last
winning season.

During his 17 year tenure,
Fallon compiled a 76-85-1 record
and won two Old Dominion Ath-
letic Conference championships.
Fallon was named the ODAC’s
Coach of the Year three times.

This past season, W&L started
with three straight losses, but fin-
ished winning five of their
last six for Fallon’s ninth
winning season.

The news came as a shock to
those who knew Fallon. Fallon
was “in great shape for a man 56
years old,” according to Norris
Aldridge,who has been an
assisstant football coach at W&L
for 26 years under three coaches.
Fallon lifted weights, ran, and
played racquetball. Aldridge said
in an interview with the Roanoke
Times & World-News , “When I
was told [that Fallon had died], I
had to ask the person to repeat it
twice.” Aldridge was in Fallon’s
office on Friday, and recalls that
“He seemed to be in a good mood.
He wasn’t sick.” Junior Robert
Hull called Fallon a “father fig-

superb motivator.

Coach Gary Fallon inspires players with a ﬁery pep talk
during a Generals football game. Fallon was noted as a

ure” to the players, the school, and the
community. “I can’t begin to describe
with words how I felt about Gary
Fallon,” said Hull. “I loved him. He
was my coach; he was my friend.”
The Syracuse University graduate was
the dean of ODAC football coaches.
Fallon came to Lexington after six years
as an assistant coach at Princeton and
coached the Generals longer than any
of the previous 27 head coaches in the
program’s 105 year history.
“Football is here to add to an
individual ’ s college experience, not take
the place of academics,” he said of his
coaching philosophy. “The aim of our
program is to develop the total person,
one who can leave us with his degree in
hand after four years, one who can
reﬂect back on his college career and
see it as a meaningful and important

learning experience.”

This may not have sounded like
the philosophy of a man who had
played big-time Division I football,
but it was a philosophy that seemed
to bring Fallon success throughout
his life.

Anative of Watertown, New York,
Fallon earned 17 varsity letters at
Watertown High and Manlius Mili-
tary School.

Fallon then earned a scholarship
to Syracuse University, where he
starred in football and lacrosse. A
fullback responsible for opening
holes for 1961 Heisman Trophy
winner Ernie Davis, Fallon was a
key member of the Orangemen’s
’59 national championship team. He
was a member of the All-East foot-
ball squad his senior year and, as a

starting midfielder, captained
Syracuse’s 1962 lacrosse team. He
also wrestled during his busy colle-
giate athletic career.

Following his graduation, Fallon
played three years of professional
football. After a season with the
Minnesota Vikings, Fallon went
north to the Canadian Football
League, where he played with the
Hamilton Tiger Cats and the Toronto
Argonauts.

He spent the next six years with
the U.S. Marine Corps, two years on
active duty and four as a reservist.

In 1967, he received his M.A. in
special education from Syracuse.

Fallon took the reigns of Wash-
ington & Lee football in 1978. Two
years later, the Generals posted their
first winning season since 1967, the
final year of Lee McLaughlin’s
coaching tenure. W&L has had only
four losing seasons since.

In 1981, the 8-2 Generals won the
ODAC for the program’s first cham-
pionship in 20 seasons. Fallon was
named the conference’s Coach of
the Year for a season that marked
the beginning ofW&L’swinningest
era since the Mclaughlin years. The
Generals capped their sixth straight
winning season by again winning
the ODAC title in 1985.

Fallon’s players have earned a
first-team All-ODAC selection 61
times and he has coached 12 All-
Americans.

This past fall, W&Lbegan Fallon’s
17th season by dropping its first
three games and totaling just two
points. However, the Generals came
together and posted a 5-1 record the
rest of the way. Included in that
stretch was a 13-7 upset of regional
power Guilford. The heavily
underdogged Generals stopped re-
peated late scoring attempts by the
7-1 Quakers, dashing the 5,300
hometown fans’ hopes for an ODAC
championship. “It was the most ex-
citing game I’ve seen in my 17
years,” Fallon said.

The Generals ended the season
with a 14-11 win at Swarthmore
College to earn a 5-4 record.

Fallon was a member of the Ameri-
can Football Coaches Association
and served on the NCAA Division

III rankings committee. He also
worked as an official for collegiate
lacrosse, working games in both the
ACC and NCAA tournaments.
Freshman Seth McKinley, whose
emergence at tailback helped spark
the team’s strong finish in ’94, said
Fallon played a large role in
McKinley’s decision to come to
W&L. “When I came to visit the
school, I had a long talk with him,”
McKinley said. “He was one of the
main reasons why I came here.”
Hull has chosen to dedicate his
final season with the Generals to his

coach’s memory.

“He was an amazing individual
who helped to forge my character,”
Hull said. “He will always live in
my memory. My senior season goes
out to the ‘great Falcon.”’

Mike Walsh, Director of Athlet-
ics, is certain that Fallon’s 17 years
at W&Lwill be known as the ‘Fallon
Era’ in memory of the “enthusiasm
and zeal, the commitment to excel-
lence, and the ability to motivate
young men toward a common goal”
that Fallon embodied.

Fallon, an avid New York Yan-

kees fan, was a man who seemed to
make his mark at W&L in more
ways than as just a football coach.
Walsh believes the W&L commu-
nity to be in “a state of shock, be-
cause we’ve lost a true friend, a
wonderful coach, and an unusually
fine person.”

A 1979 reporter from The Ring-
tum Phi seemed to know the second-
year coach well when he noted,
“Head coach Gary Fallon is a nice
guy—too nice a guy to have a 2-10
career record.”

Walsh met with the football team
and coaches last evening, providing
an opportunity for them all to be
together and share memories and
thoughts about Fallon.

A funeral service will be held
Wednesday, May 3, at 11:00 a.m. in
Lee Chapel. Burial with military
rites will follow in the Stonewall
Jackson Cemetary in Lexington. The
family will receive friends from 3 to
5 p.m. and from 7 to 9 p.m. on
Tuesday at the Harrison Funeral
Home on South Main St.

Fallon is survived by his wife,
Patricia Grant Fallon, three daugh-
ters, and seven grandchildren.

Memorial donations may be made
to St. Patrick’s Church, 221 W.
Washington Street, Lexington, VA
