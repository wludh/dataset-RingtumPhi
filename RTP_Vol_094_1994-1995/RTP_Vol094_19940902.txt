THE FRESHMAN ISSUE

By SARAH GILBERT
Phi Executive Editor

Washington and Lee’s student
governing body, called the Ex-
ecutive Committee, is basically
responsible for the care of two
important parts of the student
body: our honor and our money.

The first part of this care you
will see very soon, as Kevin
Webb, EC president, and his band
of EC representatives help_to ori-
ent you to the Washington and

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

Lee honor system.

The honor system orientation
is one of the- most important parts
of your introduction to W&L, as
we consider the honor system to
be integral to our fine tradition of
scholarship and conduct. With-
out it, we would not be half the
university we are today, and
Webb is entrusted with both edu-
cating you and implementing the
honor system in its most practi-
cal form, conducting investiga-
tions and hearings.

The EC is also concerned with

collectingandapportioningthe
money raised from your stu-
dent activities fees, and it is he
who helps to decide where the
money goes.

The EC is made up of a
representative from each law
and undergraduate class at
W&L. The elections for
upperclass officers are held in
the spring, and the freshmen
and first-year law students
elect their representatives in
the fall.

The EC typically operates

Freshmen and upperclassmen are undertaking the monumental task of moving their lives from
back home to down home Lexington.

By SARAH GILBERT
Phi Executive Editor

Problems in recent years with
freshman men doing poorly in
classes during rush has led the
lnterfraternity Council to adopt a
modified rush program.

Only one band party will be
allowed at each fraternity during
rush, as opposed to a more open
allowance last year. These band
parties must be completely dry,
with a rule that even brothers
who are of age must not drink in
the house during the party.

Associate Dean of Students

Leroy “Buddy”Atkins, who acts
as the Dean of Greek Affairs,
said that national laws were the
driving force behind the new,
stricter “dry” rules this year.
“The main point [of the new
program] is to get rid of alcohol,”
Atkins said. “We also want to

minimize the conflict [of rush];

freshmen tear their bids at last year's tear night. New restrictions on rush

, this year aim to make scenes like this less common.

‘ Abbreviated rush schedule
‘ cuts back on bands, drinking

with academics; we are trying to
do more on the weekends, so we
don't interfere with studying or
thinking about studying.’

Open houses, which were tra-
ditionally held nearthe end ofthe
rush period, will be held at the
beginning of rush this year.

Problems with two national
fraternities last year resulted in
campus suspensions, so the fra-
ternity pool is slightly smaller
than usual. Delta Tau Delta's

‘ er was suspended indefi-

1.3 itely by their national organiza-

tion last spring, and Phi Gamma
Delta was suspended for 18
months by the IFC last winter.

With 90 percent of Washing-
ton and Lee men pledging a fra-
ternity, the campus depends on a
smoothly-run rush to help the
school make a transition to a new
freshman class.

And with fourteen fraterni- -

ties to choose from, it is impor-
tant that each freshman has an
equal exposure to all the organi-
zations so he can make an in-
formed choice.

“We have implemented the
new program in an effort to see
that freshman and upperclassmeni
get off to a better start in the fall
term,” said Atkins.

After rush, the IFC and the
Student Affairs Committee will
review the issue ofdelayed rush,
which has been discussed and
proposed as an option for W&L
for several years, but never imple-
mented.

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA

with a very large budget, around
$240,000, and student organi-
zations make their proposals for
funding in the yearly budget
hearings held in September.

Last year, the Executive
Committee revised the White
Book, the bible of Washington
and Lee’s honor code.

As well as orienting the
freshmen to the honor code, the
EC must also take responsibil-
ity for breaking in the new fac-
ulty members. Each new fac-
ulty member will receive a let-

ter about the honor system dur-
ing the summer prior to his or
her employment, and will re-
ceive a visit from an EC mem-
ber upon arriving at the W&L
campus.

Organizations funded by the
EC include the student newspa-
pers, the yearbook (called the
Calyx), club sports such as la-
crosse, rugby and men’s volley-
ball, student concerts such as
next weekend’s concert at the
Pavilion. The Hoodoo Gurus
will be playing at a free concert

ognized individuals, and law
school organizations like the Stu-
dent Bar Association, which
plans social activities and lec-

Freshman class of ‘98
impressive as ever

By PHIL CARROTI‘

Phi Managing Editor

The admissions office didn’t quite hit the
male/female ratio of 60/40; the class of ‘98 is 58/

Every year at the beginning of school the
spotlight is on the incoming freshman class and
how they will size up against previous classes.

According to the bare facts, this year’s fresh-
man class looks to be one of the strongest

high school.

OPINION

 

To the Freshmen

As ifyou had not heard it enough, we at TheRing-
tum Phi would like to welcome you to our campus.

You were told at high school graduation that you
were at a turning point in your life. The end and the
beginning. And several other trite phrases (they
probably threw “Carpe Diem” in there too, but they
meant well).

Well, I hate to be repetitive, but this is a turning
point. The decisions which you make today and in
the next four years will have an extremely impor-
tant impact on your life. Perhaps more important
than any other. g

But you, we believe, are ready to make these
decisions and you have hordes of people here on
campus who are more than eager to guide you
through the tough spots.

From professors to upperclassmen, we’re all
willing to give out free advice to whomever asks for
it. If you want to know who the best professors are,
when to skip dinner at the D—hall, or how to find
Howe Hall, just ask.

Your first semester will be frustrating (probably
only the first six weeks, especially for the men
going through rush), but you’ll get the hang of it in
no time.

As you drove through Lexington this morning, it
may have seemed like a toy town, with its tourist
attractions and the picturesque but otherwise useless
shops. The diminutive town, however, has an almost
confusing array of choices whether you just want
a good sandwich or a good
haircut.

Very small or very large size people hit the jackpot
more often than the mid-ranged sizes.

Each freshman breathes fresh air into this 246

 

year old university. Each one of you has something
to offer W&L and in return it will give you four
years of memories and experiences you will never
forget, on top of an education that many will envy.

All you have to do to get the most out of W&L is
be yourself. Be the student that stood apart from the
others and was considered special enough to attend
W&L. Get involved in whatever interests you.And
have fun. These really will be the best four years of
your lives.

And tell your parents not to worry, Lexington is
one of the safest places to go to school in the
country. The administration does a good job of
keeping it that way, so tell them not to worry if you
forget to call them once in a while.

looking for a great place to take an out-of-town

tired of mass-produced food, ll Palazzo is the best bet.
And for those with tight budgets, try their delicious

The Best Coffee

You can order coffee with your meal anywhere,
but you can bet that the best place to buy coffee is a
shop wholly devoted to the magical bean. Lexington
Coffee Roasting Company pours a mean cup of
cappuccino, and their fresh-roasted coffee is the best
in town. At Christmas time, stock up on their special

“Santa’s Cinnamon Spice.”

J. Crew dress you wanted so desperately six months
ago but could not bear to pay $150 for. Once in a‘

It’s the time of the Welcoming Season

DREAM LAND
Richard Weaver

Let me begin my remarks today by
welcoming you, the class of 1998, to
“The Welcoming Season” here in Lex-
ington. In the coming days prepare to
be heartily welcomed by various deans,
professors, upper-class students, fel-
low freshmen, Jim from East Lex, W&L
Security and TheirTow—Truck Friends,
The Rockbridge County Sheriff’s De-
partment, the Cadaver Society, and
Alvin-Dennis (“The Belt People”).

I know that when I was a freshman
my, reaction was, “Who are these
people?” Then my reaction was,
“What’s for dinner?” and then “Can I
go to sleep now?“ The whole adjust-
ment process to strange little Lexing-
ton (the “Twin Peaks” of Virginia) will
take a while, but that doesn’t mean you
can't step back a minute from your
busy orientation schedule and just laugh
at the place you will soon call home.

On moving-in day two years ago
my father and I pulled up in our full-
size 4x4 Chevrolet truck, carrying all
of my earthly possessions, as well as
two ofmy friends’ things all stacked up
higher than the cab and wrapped in an
enormous blue tarp. We were the Lex-
ington Hillbillies. The various frater-
nity members who were stationed out-

_ side the dorms to help the freshmen

move in walked away from our truck,
from what I assume was fear. Does this
ring a bell with any of you?

I guess that by now you have al-
ready come, seen, and conquered Wal-
Mart, and Mom has purchased all kinds
of nice shelves and bookcases and

Tupperware and sewing kits which I
assure you will never be used for any-
thing other than building an impen-
etrable Berlin Wall between you and
your roommate. l’ll simply refer you to
a recent movie, Single White Female:
“Living with a roommate can be mur-
der.”

Now before I get some angry letters
on cute puppy stationary from people
who really liked their roommates (there
must be, what, eight or nine of those),
l’ll make itclear
nowthat just be-
cause you will
be living with
someone in a

kind of punitive cell during a war-time
rationing of space. I could sit on my
bed and without moving my body reach
any spot in my room. This made it
incredible easy to wake up at 2 p.m.,
dial the phone, pick up my wallet, and
unlock the door to allow Domino’s
Pizza (“Your Pizza Delivered in 30
Minutes Or Less By Our FleetofRolIs-
Royces”) to bring me food.

You say, “Richard, I will never buy
extra food, especially since I will be

lands on your roommate’s head while
he’s sleeping and “accidentally” seals
his mouth shut so you will no longer
hear that bizarre boiling sound that he
makes after drinking your 2-liter bottle
of Dr. Pepper.

I, of course, irresponsibly make
these generalizations drawing from the
experiences of other people. My fresh-
man year I lived alone in Graham-Lees
260, which I theorize was built as some

traces the evolu-
tion ofdining hall
entrees:

Day One:
Turkey slices wrapped around stalks of
broccoli.

Day Two: Chopped up turkey and
broccoli combination.

Day Three: Pureed turkey/broccoli
served with dumplings.

Day Four: Green .lelI—O.

Now, ifyou’ve heard enough, and if
you want to know where good food is
served, go where the truckers go, and
voila you have the Lee—Hi truck stop,

1

where waitresses will serve you 24
hours a day, seven days a week. We’re
talking waitresses that never sleep or
go home. They just watch the proces-
sion oftruckers, townies (er. .. Lexing-
ton citizens), and students who come in
to eat.

Sometimes the sleep deprivation
puts them on the edge and they’re not
quite as friendly as you might expect,
like when they throw your silverware
at you. But that’s OK; what they lack in
service they make up for eye makeup.
We’re talking Tammy Faye Bakker
territory. Or Uncle Fester from The
Addams Family.

But that’s not the point here, and the
point is, I don’t aimlessly wander from
subject to subject. Any subject I dis-
cuss, trust me, relates back to food in
some way and getting back to when
you go to Lee-Hi, you must always
have breakfast, preferably “The Gen-
eral Lee.” I won’t tell you what it
consists of (you have to find thatout for
yourself), but I will tell you I give it
five stars. (Edit0r’sNote: Richard gives
Stop-In convenience store chili dogs
ﬁve stars also, so maybe you had better
not trust his judgment.)

I’m out of space now, but look for
my commentary in the future. l’ll close
by saying: ladies and gentlemen, as
you pull down the covers and get into
your new bed tonight, questioning why
in the world your parents have left you
all alone at Washington and Lee, have
faith that in a short time you’ll be
questioning how your ever considered
any other place to go to school.

And to the current resident of Gra-
ham-Lees 260, call me here at the Phi
sometime and let me know if the old
homestead has changed much.

W&L sports gear up for 94 fall season

By STEPHEN WILLIARD
Phi Sports Editor

Each fall, every team in every sport
opens the year at 0-0. Where they go
from there depends upon the skill of
the players and coaches.

This year Washington and Lee ﬁelds
teams in four men’s and three women’s
sports. The Generals take to the water,
the court, and the ﬁeld in football,
soccer, cross—country, volleyball, and
water polo.

After a disappointing 2-8 ﬁnish last
season, the Generals have reason for
optimism this year on the gridiron.
After six narrow defeats last year, head
coach Gary Fallon returns eighteen

starters including second team All-'

Americandefensivetackle Robert Hull.

The offensive squad was hurt by the
loss of running backs Tom Mason,
who carried for over 1,000 yards last
season, and Wilson Moore, as well as
offensive lineman John Surface. Re-

turning are sophomore quarterback
Brooks Fischer, junior tackle Robert
Turner, and a stellar receiving core
includingJames Urban, Hayne Hodges,
and William Propst. The ﬁrst contest
for the Generals will be against Emory
and Henry on the tenth.

One of the most talented teams at
W&L is women’s cross-country.
Coach Jim Phemister returns almost all
of last year’s squad, including two-

time All-American Josephine Schaeffer‘

and two-time all region runner Amy
Mears, as well as co—captains Kim
Herring and Sue Deutsch.

Last year, the Generals placed sec-
ond in the South region last season
while winning their second straight
Old Dominion Athletic Conference and
state titles.

On the men’s side, coach John
Tucker ﬁelds a team centered on youth.
Leading the team are junior co—cap-
tains Tom Fink and Jeff Zeiger. Also
returning are sophomore runners Sandy
Hooper and Alvin Townley.

Football prepares for the fall season. The Generals look
to improve on last year’s 2-8 performance with the help
of several returning starters.

Both teams will open the year at the
Lebanon Valley Invitational on Satur-
day September 10, before their first
home meet against Mary Washington.

The men’s soccerteam returns seven

starters from last year. Leading the
returnees will be junior striker Shag
Drewrywho led the team in goals (7)
and points (17) last season. Also re-
turning are juniors Jeb Wofford, and
Chad Dobbins and senior Kevin Hock-
mg.
Coach Rolf Piranian returns a strong
defensive squad, led by tri-captain Alan
Christiansen, an All-ODAC midﬁelder.
Senior back Paul Wright will also aid
the defense. Anthony Mazzerelli re-
turns in goal as well.

The team looks to improve on a 5-
13 mark that dropped W&L out of the
top four in the ODAC for the ﬁrst time
ever. With the returning starters and a
strong freshman class, the Generals
could once again return to conference
prominence.

Women’s soccer will try to improve
on a solid second place ﬁnish in the
conference last year. Coach Jan
Hathorn returns a solid core ofdefend-
ers from last year’s team. Sophomore
keeper Beth Mozena leads the defense
after notching eight shutouts a year
ago. Backs Marina Jackson and
Stephanie Terwell will also lend their
experience. .

The team will have to deal with the
losses of Corinda Hankins and Angie
Carrington. Senior Anne Spruill and
sophomore Jenni Grant will shore up
the midﬁeld and Michelle Bauman will
be relied on for scoring after leading
the team in goals last season with six.

The W&L volleyball team will be
looking to move into the top ranks in
the conference for the first time this
year. The addition of assistant coach
Brenda Davis from Guilford should
help the team in the pursuit ofits goals.

The team returns captains Jennifer
Garrigus and Cheryl Taurassi as well
as a strong nucleus of players from last
year’s squad. One returning player
who wasn’t on the team last year is
junior Chrissy Hart who missed last
year with a knee injury.

W&L water polo has a strong tradi-
tion. The ﬁrst order ofbusiness for this
year’s team will be to replace senior
leader Greg Golub. Last season Golub
tallied 73 goals and 38 assists for the
Generals as they captured the Division
Ill Eastern Water Polo Association title.

Coach Paige Remillard does return
a deep team with a great deal of expe-
rience. Two All-Americans, Reuben
Munger, a second teamer, and David
Silvester, a first teamer, will be called
upon to lead the Generals in their quest
of a third straight Division III crown.

Overall the fall season holds prom-
ise for all the athletic squads at Wash-
ington and Lee. Each team has the
potential to turn in a solid season, but
only the test ofa full season can show

who will respond to the challenge.

The fall season last year was a
successful one for a number of the
teams at W&L. Those teams look to
remain at the top ofthe heap, while
some, like football, and soccer, look
to return to the upper echelons ofthe
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
and continue a strong tradition of
athletic competition at W&L. Each
team has set its own goals. It is those
goals which are important.
