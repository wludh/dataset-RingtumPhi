set up in the Co-op, the quadran-
gle in the old dorms, and the lob-
bies of Washington and Tucker
halls.

Election rules, laid out for the
candidates Monday night by Vot-
ing Board chairman Bill Kerr, are
about the same as in past elec-
tions except that the number of
large posters or banners, referr-
ed to in the past as “campaign big-
gies,” is left up to the discretion
of the candidates instead of being
limited by the E.C.

Candidates will be allowed to

limits and other regulations for
the run-off, should one become
necessary, will be decided at next
week’s E.C. meeting. The run-off

one week from today, but may
still be changed at the discretion
of the E.C,

Candidates are required to limit
the number of campaign posters
to 50, including poster-platform
displays at fraternity houses. No
posters are allowed on the Colon-
nade.

Candidates whe do not turn in

Huntley, McDowell, MacNelly,

and Breslin to lecture

The Contact °76 symposium
moves into high gear in the next
seven days with four speakers
scheduled in three varied but
promising presentations. The
speakers are W&L President
R.E.R. Huntley, Richmond Times-
Dispatch columnist and Washing-
ton correspondent Charles Mc-
Dowell, Richmond News Leader
cartoonist Jeff MacNelly, and au-
thor and columnist Jimmy Bres-
lin.

Huntley is not the first mem
ber of the W&L faculty or admini-
stration to appear in conjunction
with a Contact program, but the
Contact committee feels that his
speech tonight wil be the most
important ever made by a mem-
ber of the W&L community dur-
ing the symposium.

Huntley’s topic will be “Honor,”

REVIEWandOuTLooK "The candidates’ platforms

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
March 4, 1976

It’s election time

It's one of those times of year again that leads us to say
“it’s that time of year again.” By now the bulletin boards have
been plastered four times over with chartreuse and passion
pink posters, fraternity types and freshmen have been sub-
jected to overblown rhetoric during meals, and a certain few
smiling faces are more visible than ever in the Co-op, In other
words, the “Big Three” election is fast approaching.

In glaring contrast to previous years, every race is con-
tested; instead of exciting one-man races we have two exciting
tandem contests and even a three-way campaign.

For the office of student body president we have candidates
Scott Franklin and Tom Hunter, both rising seniors in the un-
dergraduate school. Both have been involved in campus poli-
tics for some time, although Franklin has maintained a high-
er profile (which may or may not be an asset).

The contenders for the post of vice-president include San-
dy Stradtman, “Swede” Takacs, and Rob Daniels. Stradtman,
already a member of the Executive Committee, holds the ad-
vantage, although Takacs with his Continental perspective and
Daniels, a fresh face in campus politics, could pose a semi-
serious threat.

And then there is the race for secretary, Jim Koch and Rog-
er Durham have squared off in this battle — Koch has been a
class officer; Durham is the dark horse.

There is a disturbing note in this whole affair: every can-
didate is a rising senior. The obvious implication is that there
will be no holdover talent for the following year in the top
offices. While not a serious threat to the continued mainte-
nance of our student bureaucracy, the lack of rising juniors or
candidates from the law school is not a favorable trend,

No burning issues are apparent this year: the definitive co-
education vote has been taken by the Board of Trustees, the
$5 proposal died a deserved death, and no one has proposed
any sweeping changes in the Honor System. It appears that the
issue of the day may be the candidates’ stances in regard to
yrain parties.

The lack of definition among the various contenders may
unfortunately precipitate a (not unusual) lack of interest in
the proceedings on the part of the general student body, We
hope that this does not occur, Even if there are no flamboyant
characters running for office, who advocate the abolishment of
Wednesday classes, we should still vote. That way, when
next year's Executive Committee censures the drama depart-
ment or forms its umpteenth committee, we can say “I voted
for the other guy.”

Tinseltown revisited

The salute to Hollywood on Friday night was a smashing
success. Several chairs, a few false partitions, and some silk
wallpaper were smashed or ripped; about 1300 members of the
W&L community and their dates were in similar condition by
night’s end.

The 69th annual Faney
startling finesse, and Student Activities Board co-chairmen

Dress Ball was executed with
Clark Thompson and Terry \twood, as well as their diligent
flunkies, should be commended. From the illuminated marquee
and oscillating skylights to the giant slides of Bogie and Gre
ble and Spanky and Kong, with all the live entertainment in-
between, the Student Center had nearly something for every-
one (except perhaps a life-size poster of Marilyn Monroe),

Ticket sales were between 1000 and 1100 (as of the
meeting Monday night final figures were not available), Gross
receipts were higher than expected, although expenses outran
estimations also. By the final accounting it appears that Faney
Dress will have cost slightly less than anticipated after ticket
sales are subtracted,

\ few errant partygoers arrived sans appropriate formal
wear: in most cases these were admitted, The SAL did turn
away a few souls who were wearing denim jackets or sport-
coats. Some individuals were spied at the ball wearing tennis
shoes beneath their flashy tuxedos, and a few dates wore
pants suits or cocktail dresses. Probably 956, of those in at
tendanee were in the correct attire for the occasion, which is
consoling to the traditionalists among us. We do hope that
next year 1006; will be appropriately clad, including faculty
members,

Susan Ford and her coterie of not-soeseeret service men pro
vided a little extra spice, not only Friday night but throughout
the weekend, Her visit was purely for the fun of it, and we
have been assured that she was not here to bug the Mock Con
vention offices,

\ good time was had by all...

Scott Franklin

Fellow Students:

This Monday you will be asked
to participate in the election of
the student body officers who will
represent you on the Executive
Committee next year. This is your
opportunity to voice an opinion on
issues which are of central im-
portance to all of us within the
W&L community. And as a can-
didate for Student Body Presi-
dent, I want to listen to any sug-
gestions you might have while at
the same time answering any ques-
tions you may have of me particu-
larly.

The primary thoughts when
choosing student body officers
should focus upon, I think, which
candidate will best represent your
opinions and fulfill the respon-
sibilities of the position. This en-
tails having probably, experience
with the Honor System and the
mechanics of the student govern-
ment in general. This permits the
President to guide the members
of the E. C. in their day-to-day
workings and better organize long
term projects — essential skills
for the man to have who fills the
office of President. These are sim-
ply strengths, much like that of
possessing a knowledge of the pro-
cedural aspects of honor trials,
etc., which allow the President to
more effectively carry out his re-
sponsibilities. Being a mediator is
only one duty of this office: the
President should be able to direct
the Committee from a base of ex-
perience.

Three years on the Executive
Committee have provided me
with a familiarity, and under-
standing which 1 think will be
tremendously helpful in fulfilling
my obligations if elected. I have
a practical understanding of the
committee system, for example.
In my three years here, I have
seen different approaches to the
decision-making process, heard
numerous honor cases presented
to the E.C. and learned firsthand
about the responsibilities of the
President. I would be able to be-
gin work with insight, with the
members of the Committee begin-
ning in September. This time,
which otherwise would be spent in
learning the “ins and outs” of
our student government here, will
be free so that I can direct atten-
tions to the concerns of all of us
within the community.

For instance, my attention can
be immediately turned to the even
further strengthening of the Stu-

dent Activities Board so to better
offer both direct student involve-
ment and input in the form of sug-
gestions. I see the need for yet
more energies to be expanded in
town-gown relations. This liaison
is invaluable and must be more ef-
fectively utilized. And especially
important will be the President’s
ability to retain the undergradu-
ate communication with the law
students as they move to Lewis
Hall.

An effective orientation to the
Honor System for freshmen must
be carefully planned and thought-
fully brought off. And a similar, if
not, more in-depth orientation
must be provided for first-year
law, transfer, and exchange stu-
dents. But to do this, the Presi-
dent must believe in what he will
tell these students and be able to
convey his thoughts convincingly
— an understanding stemming
from direct involvement on the
E.C. seems almost essential for
this.

I recognize my duties to the
Executive Committee, the Student
Body as a whole, but also the over-
riding obligation to meet the con-
cerns of each student individu-
ally. And I sincerely believe my
willingness to assume these duties
at any personal cost and my past
direct involvement of three years
on the Committee can enable me
to more effectively and respon-
sibly represent Washington and
Lee as Student Body President.
Thank you very much.

Scott Franklin

Tom Hunter

Fellow students,

The position of President of
the Student Body at Washington
and Lee, with its attendant re-
sponsibilities, is directed toward
the maintenance of a_ strong
Honor System. The President, as
a member of the Executive Com-
mittee, must possess a degree of
dedication, a sincerity of purpose,
and a familiarity in the process of
student government which will re-
sult in an effective Honor System.
In the past, while serving in the
office of Junior Class President
and Sophomore Vice-President, |
believe that I have attained the
qualities which would make for
an able Student Body President.

Further, I believe the office of
President provides the best oppor-
tunity for the implementation of
several policies. The financial sup-
port of groups which are of inter-

Letter To The Editor

Editor, the Ring-tum Phi:

Perhaps you have an explanation
as to what is wrong with the mem-
bers of the Student Activities
Board. Early in the Fall term a
music preference poll was con-
ducted by the SAB. The results in-
dicated that 60.2% of the stu-
dents polled preferred rock music,
23% preferred soul and 16% pre-
ferred country rock.

When this poll was conducted.
our faith in the members of the
SAB was momentarily renewed;
it appeared as though they intend-
ed to be democratic for a change.
They are to be commended for
booking both a rock and a soul
band for Homecoming Weekend.

However, it is now evident to
us that the SAB members have de-
cided to blatantly and unjustly
ignore the results of their own
poll!! Fancy Dress Weekend left
60°% of the student body musically
alienated; a much more appropri-
ate tithe would have been Fancy
Soul Weekend. We would have
preferred silence over the Mar-
vellettes and the Drifters. In our
oninion, if the SAB intends to con-
tinue to ignore the musical taste
of the majority of the student
body, all of their funds should be
allocated to the film committee,
and for grain parties open to the
entire student body.

Otherwise, the “activities fee”
should be discontinued and the

SAB should be dissolved. We sin-
cerely hope that there is no truth
to the rumor that the Spinners are
being considered for a Spring con
cert; what a worthless waste of
our money that would be!
Personal opinions aside, it is
obvious to us that when the mem-
bers of the SAB have a number of
bands under consideration for a
ziven event, they should poll the
student body beforehand. The
SAB clearly has no right to disre-
gard the musical tastes of the vast
majority of the student body.
Sincerely,
—William E. Birbick
~-Warwick Seay
~-Henry Taylor

~—Joseph G. Fitzgerald

The choice of The Drifters as the
grain party band was not made
by the SAB, but by the freshman
class, who were the sponsors of
the party. Grain parties are al-
ready “open to the entire student
body,” and it appeared to us that
no one at the parties (concerts in
question was sulking in the corner
over the music. (Music at a grain
party is of secondary importance
in any case.) In the past the rock
concerts brought to campus have
been less successful than soul con-
certs; however, your suggestion
for a poll on specific bands is a
reasonable idea.

feel that relations between the

Sandy Stradtman

Fellow Students:

The office of the Vice-President
of the Student Body is a position
which carries with it large respon-
sibilities. And, as such, it must be
occupied by someone who is well
qualified to hold that position. But
of at least equal importance, I
think, is a dedication toward the
responsibilities entailed. Through
my involvement with the Exe-
cutive Committee not only as a
class representative but as a stu-
dent body officer, I have become
quite familiar with the duties of
the Vice-President. And, | want
to do the job as best I can, a de-
dication that comes from my pre-
vious involvement.

The Vice-President is account-
able for the responsibilities allo-
cation of all student body funds.
He is a member of the Faculty
Executive Committee and is now a
voting member of the Alumni
Board of Directors. Of equal im-
portance, he is the technical ad-
viser to the accused during honor
trials. The candidate you vote for
must be qualified to fulfill at
least these duties.

The thoughts which I want to
leave you with are very simple
and, more importantly, I think,
they do not commit me to pro-
posals which I cannot singly in-
stitute: if elected, I will honor-
ably assume the responsibiliities
before mentioned, and, in so do-
ing, I will act in the best interest
of you whom I represent as effec-
tively as I know how. I made this
same promise to you last year and,
with all sincerity, my duties as
Secretary have been first in prior-
ity throughout the year. The same
will be true next year should I be
elected.

As you might recall, the one
specific promise I did make last
year was to better familiarize
members of our community with
the particularities of our Honor
System. To effect this, excerpts
from the Honor System White
Book have appeared regularly in
the Ring-tum Phi. And I have con-
tinually tried to increase my
awareness of the advantages and
problems of honor systems in
general by attending relevant con-
ferences—notably, spring discus-
sions at the University of Virginia.
The insights I gained there and
the suggestions that were offer-
ed have greatly helped me in
dealing with the specific problems
of our system here.

In essence, what I can bring to
the office and offer to you is ex-
perience, a desire to do my best,
and a promise to give all the time

It is important that we all give
careful thought to the election so
as to elect the best possible peo-
ple. I will be available to you this
week to answer any questions of
me in an effort to help you make
the best choice. Thank you.

Sincerely,
Sandy Stradtman

“Swede” Takacs

In the fall of 1974, I had the
privilege to come to W&L to get a
dose of American campus life. Al-
most two years later, the expo-
sure has generated some reac-
tions. I am sorry to note that con-
cern with student government has
been on steady decline since the
early 70’s. The per cent of the stu-
dent body voting in a campus
election is below 50.

What, then, has caused this sit-
uation?

I would, without any hesitation,
put the blame on election prac-
tices employed by candidates in
the past. Every year, at election
time, the hopeful few dig up some
“hot” issues to campaign on.
Whether they can actually deliv-
er on the promises is not viewed
as essential because the main
thing is to win the election, with
the fundamental assumption be-
ing that once you are elected, your
problems are over, whereas that
actually is just the beginning of
the process of governing. Year
after year, candidates commit the
cardinal error of overseiling hot
issues, raising peoples’ expecta-
tions and in the end creating dis-
appointment. Apathy _ results.
Faith in democracy must rest on
something Abe Lincoln said: “You
can’t fool all the people all the
time.”

Presently, candidates feel pres-
sure to provide controversial is-
sues and patent answers, regard-
less of their values, as long as
they sound good. After election
day, the great silence falls and dis-
appointment rises proportionally.
Apathy grows. It is unfortunate,
since it allows the emergence of a
clique, running the E.C. year after
year in splendid isolation. The sit-
uation has created numerous
“E.C.-majors,” siting out their col-
lege years in the Student Center
with their records mostly unques-
tioned and their reelection apa-
thetically approved.

Pluralism makes democracy.
Democracy, when operating
smoothly, must constantly find
room for people below who are
pressing their way up.

It’s with this in mind I’m run-
ning for Vice President of the E.C.
The primary function of the E.C,
is to uphold the Honor System,
which I believe is in danger unless
an effort is made by the commit-
tee to generate wide spread inter-
est on campus for student govern-
ment. I cannot and will not pro-
mise what I am not sure I can
keep, but I promise to work hard
to bring the issues of student gov-
ernment out to the student body
and thereby avoid friction be-
tween the E.C. and different in-
terest groups. Otherwise clashes
are bound to occur. The creative
freedom of the University Theatre
is an issue of concern, The Minor-
ity Affairs Coordinating Commit-
tee is in my opinion a piece of
scamping and unless its represen-
tatives are given voting rights on
the standing committees, time will
inevitably show its low value.
These are two things that interest
me and which could be worked
out rather easily.

Furthermore, I believe | have

March 4, 1976

Lacrosse season has begun

By BILL FLESHER

Spring began at Washington and
Lee at 2:05 p.m., February 28,
1976.

No, there wasn’t a sudden blos-
soming of leaves prompted by a
new discovery made in Howe Hall.
Nor was the first day of spring
moved upon executive order from
a W&L administration member, a
visiting Secret Service agent, or
Arthur Ponzarelli (and if you don’t
know who he is, well, “Hey, you’re
not cool.”),

Understand if you will. Spring
at W&L officially begins when the
referee, even if he is a W&L law
student, blows the whistle to start
the first official lacrosse activity
of the year.

All right, so it was a scrimmage,
and so it was intrasquad. That
makes no difference, for with that
first faceoff another Generals’ la-
crosse season, and another Wash-
ington and Lee spring, was under-
way.

The Generals have made the
spring months most enjoyable the
past four years, qualifying each
year for the NCAA Lacrosse
Championship tournament.

Since the arrival of head coach
Jack Emmer in Lexington in the
summer of 1972, W&L has com-
piled a three-season record of
40-9, and has annually appeared
in the NCAA semi-finals, only to
lose to the eventual national
champion each year.

Whether the spring of 1976 will
be as pleasant remains to be seen.
The Generals play 13 games and
two exhibitions this year, a busier
schedule than most teams but a
light one for W&L in comparison
to their 19, 17, and 21-game slates
of the past three years.

Defending national titleist Mary-
land, which eliminated the Gen-
erals from last year’s tournament,
is the big addition to the regular
season schedule (May 1 at College
Park). Other new opponents are
Virginia Tech (March 31 in Lex-
ington) and a traveling team of

Norberg selected
best performer
at indoor relays

Washington and Lee freshman
Jack Norberg (of Valley Forge,
Pa.) was selected the Outstanding
Performer as the Generals finish-
ed a close second in the Lynch-
burg College Indoor Relays last
week,

Norberg ran on three winning
relay teams, was on the long jump
relay team that finished second
and the mile relay team that plac-
ed fourth.

W&L also got outstanding per-
formances from team captain
John Tucker, who ran legs on
three winning relays and partici-
pated with the long jump team
that finished second, and weight-
man Phil Dunlay who won both
the 35-lb. weight throw (52 feet,
3 inches) and the shot( 42 feet,
11 inches).

The Generals swept the weight
throw, with Dunlay, Bob Propst
and Hank Phillips finishing 1-2-3,
while Dunlay and Steve Schwei-
zerhof were 1-2 in the shot.

Host Lynchburg College won
the overall competition with 56
points, folowed by W&L with 47.
Others competing were Bridge-
water, High Point and Francis
Marion.

NCAA: Wé&L out, Shepherd in

By SAMMY THOMPSON

Washington and Lee’s basket-
ball Generals’ chances of receiv-
ing a post-season National Col-
legiate Athletic Association (NC-
AA) tournament bid this year are
slim at best.

The Generals split their last two
regularly scheduled games of the
season, beating Maryville College
and losing to Madison, giving
them a 19-7 record for the year
and a 13-1 mark in Virginia Col-
lege Athletic Association (VCAA)
competition.

This record was enough to give
the Generals the VCAA crown.

As a result of W&L’s fine sea-
son play, the Division Il South
Atlantic regional committee voted
unanimously to send the Generals
to the basketball playoffs—which
start March 11.

Nevertheless, the NCAA cen-
tral office in Kansas City has de-
cided, so far, not to give W&L a
bid. Instead, bids were given to
Monmouth College of New Jersey,
Lynchburg College, Shepherd Col-
lege and Glassboro State.

Both Monmouth and Glassboro
State deserved a bid. Lynchburg,
which W&L lost to by one point at
the beginning of the year and beat
by six points the second time, got
a bid automatically by winning
the Dixie Conference. Shepherd
got the bid with a 29-2 record.
This, however, is where the ques-
tion mark comes in.

According to the W&L coach-
ing staff, Shepherd might be in-
eligible for the playoffs because of
suspected NCAA violations.

The first alleged violation is
perhaps the number of games
Shepherd played this year, NCAA
rules state that a Division III team
can play a maximum of 26 games.
Three of Shepherd's games are ex-
cluded from this rule, however.
This would leave them two games
over the limit if they did in fact
play 31 games.

W&L head coach Verne Can-
field had to drop the alumni game
and a scrimmage to comply with
this rule.

Another possible violation has
to do with when Shepherd start-
ed the season. The W&L coaches
said Shepherd may have started
too soon.

The “NCAA Division III Basket-
ball Handbook 1976” states that
Shepherd “is not eligible for post
season competition.”

Several things have been done
to protect Shepherd's selection in
the tournament,

W&L athletic director Bill Me-
Henry has sent a letter of protest

committee also has gotten in touch

Lynchburg College’s athletic di-
rector has resigned in protest, ac-
cording to an informed source.

Several school representatives
have called Canfield to express
their dismay.

But the NCAA central office of-
ficials, so far, have not budged one
inch. The only concession they
have given is that they will invest-
igate the matter with Shepherd
next month at the national meet-
ing.

This will be too late for W&L,
however, because the tournament
is in two weeks.

An NCAA spokesman said, how-
ever, that W&L’s chances of re-
ceiving a bid are not closed.

Captain John Podgajny doubts
this statement. “Our chances are

The White team never led until
Sindler scored an extra-man goal
to spark a three-goal third-quarter
burst to give the White team a

lead to 5-3, but final-period goals
by Bishop and Sindler put the
game out of reach.

Rugby club seeks official support

By KEN MASTRILLI

The W&L Rugby club is about
to embark on probably its biggest
season to date. With a fine crop of
outstanding freshmen and a num-
ber of veteran upperclassmen the
team hopes to provide the Uni-

very slim,” he said, “of getting a
bid.”

Podgajny said he was disap-
pointed with the NCAA’s action
concerning Shepherd .He said he
thought suspected violations were
brushed under the rug by the
NCAA for convenience sake.

Podgajny summed the whole
thing up saying, “It stinks.”

If Shepherd had been disquali-
fied, chances are good that the
Generals would have gotten a
NCAA bid.

W&L certainly had a fine sea-
son ,compiling a 13-game winning
streak and winning the most
games since 1967 when that team
also won 19.

The Generals’ 19th victory came
Feb. 25 against the Maryville Col-
lege Scots in which W&L trounced
their opponent, 110-82.

Did you know that:

College co-ed.

versity with but another one of
the entertaining activities which
the springtime always manages to
produce.

Due to some heavy recruiting
by last years’ members of the
freshman class, the team hopes to
build the program into one that
the student body will be proud of,
a program that the team hopes
will be supported wholeheartedly
by both administrators and other
school officials who had previous-
ly doubted the viability of the
club as an entity which merited
recognition.

By incorporating members of
the student body, especially in the
ranks of the underclassmen, the
club hopes to gain this official if
not vital recognition. The paln
calls for the gradual takeover of
the administrative duties of the
club to be placed eventually in
the hands of the underclassmen
in hopes of eventually ridding the
club of the so-called “stigma” of
domination by the law school
members and also in hopes of at-
tracting more underclassmen to
join the club.

The club would like to invite
the student body to its first match
of the year. The match will be
held somewhere on the school
grounds, but owing to some sche
duling problems the exact site has
not yet been determined. The
game will be played on March 13,
which is a Sunday, at 1:30 p.m.

Richmond compiled 361 points,
VPI - 305 and W&L had 259.

The Generals were led by sen-
ior Billy Cogar who was a double
winner in the one- and three-met-
er diving events. Cogar easily
qualified for the Nationals with
his performance.

Sophomore John Hudson won
first place in the 1650 freestyle
event though he swam with an
illness,

W&L also qualified both their
400 and 800-yard relay teams in
the Nationals.

Tad van Leer and Keith Romich
were individual qualifiers for the
Generals. Van Leer qualified in
the 50 and 100-yard freestyle and
the 100 butterfly and Romich met
the 200-yard freestyle require-
ments.

VCU was tough for the Gen-
erals and everybody else in the
meet breaking seven state records.

W&L head coach Bill Stearns
remarked that Fancy Dress Week-
end was a bad time to have the
state meet.

Maybe they will fare better
March 18-20 at Washington, Penn.
in the NCAA Division III Na-
tionals Championship.

mouth.” The Council decided to
let S.A.C. look into the matter.

Several members raised objec-
tion to the first paragraph of the
statement, which served as a very
general introduction. After some
discussion of this, Professor Bu-
ford Stephenson suggested that
the Council was making “moun-
tains out of molehills.” He con-
sidered the paragraph to be in-
nocuous.

The Council finally approved
the statement 13-1-3. This means
that it is now official policy, since
the University Council exercises
supervision over fraternity af-
fairs.

The statement reads, in part:

Social fraternities at Washing-
ton and Lee are a valuable and in-
tegral part of both the University
and Lexington communities; as
such, fraternity chapters have im-
portant privileges, as well as re-
sponsibilities to those communi-
ties.

As a particularly visible part of
the Washington and Lee commun-
ity, fraternities—through the ac-
tions and conduct of their mem-
bers—reflect directly upon the
University and affect its efforts to
attract new students and to main-
tain active alumni support. Also,
because chapters are located in
the residential areas of Lexington,
such actions and conduct affect
the city and its residents.

Chapters therefore are expect-
ed to maintain adequately the
physical appearance of fraternity
property and to assure the struc-
tural integrity of chapter houses.
Chapter members are expected to
conform to standards of gentle-
manly conduct and to exhibit a
concern for the rights and sensi-
bilities of others.

sion of these matters, the Student

The E.C. is of the opinion that
honor hearings in which both the
accused and any witnesses have
the least specific knowledge pos-
sible about the case tend best to
be the fact-finding investigations
they are meant to be. A typical
charge served to an accused stu-
dent might specify that he pos-

en on a particular day. Any evi-
dence is generally presented at
the hearing to best elicit the facts.
Witnesses are kept separate to

Fellow Students:

This coming Monday, you will
have the opportunity to cast your
vote for three members of the
W&L community whom you be-
lieve can most effectively repre-
sent your views on the Executive
Committee. The officers you elect
must be able and willing to con-
vey your concerns. Most impor-
tantly, they must be ready to ac-
tively do this.

Neither myself nor my oppon-
ent have served on the Executive
Committee. However, through my
work as a class officer and mem-
ber of the Student Control Com-
mittee the past three years, I have
learned a great deal about the
inner workings of the University.
My responsibilities have necessi-
tated my gaining an awareness of
the mechanics of the government
here and—most importantly — I
have dealt with people in these
positions. I believe I know what
the majority of students feel and
the problems we all encounter
here. This understanding is what
I would bring to the office of Sec-
retary. | would hope that this
kind of understanding would per-
mit other students to feel more
comfortable in coming to me with
suggestions and concerns.

An awareness of needs, how-
ever, is not all that is required.
The Secretary must be willing to
put in long hours of what is often
tedious work. Therefore, it was
only after learning about the re-
sponsibilities and giving careful
thought to the duties entailed in
the position that my decision to
seek election was made.

I have learned that promises
committing an entire body for
something simply cannot be made
and I refuse to do so. But a pro-
mise to devote my time and do my
best, if elected, can be made. I
will willingly commit myself to
this.

Your decision is an important
one: Please evaluate all candidates
with care. Should you have any
questions for me, I will be cam-
paigning all week on campus.

Thank you.

Respectfully submitted,

and Norm Kristoff played their
last home game in a Generals’ uni-
form, Podgajny received a stand-
ing ovation when he fouled out of
the game with two minutes left.

Podgajny led the Generals in
scoring that night with 30 points
followed by Bob Flint (15), Pat
Dennis (14), Kristoff (12) and
Chris Larson (11).

Maryville’s Randy Lambert led
all scorers with 31 points.

Against Madison, W&L led most
of the first half, but allowed the
score to be tied at intermission,
30-30.

Midway through the second half,
the Generals turned the ball over
10 out of 12 times and Madison
took the lead by as much as 11
points with eight minutes left to
play.

W&L narrowed the lead to five
points with a full-court press, but
time ran out and Madison won,
70-65.

Madison’s Pat Dosh led all scor-
ers with 26 points while Podgajny
and Larson had 16 points each for
W&L.

Podgajny’s point total left him
just 16 points short of reaching
1,000 career points. The 6-foot-2
senior captain averaged about 18
points for the season to lead the
team in that department.

Podgajny also was the Generals’
leading field goal and free throw
percentage shooter, defensive re-
bounder and leader in defensive
recoveries. He was voted most
valuable player in this year’s W&L
Invitational Tournament.

With these credentials, Podga-
jny has an excellent chance for an
All-American selection. Hopefully,
he will have better luck at this
than W&L did in receiving a
NCAA bid.

Recruitment and releases

(Continued from page 1)
cedure by reorganizing the Media
committee. Braun was put in
charge of news releases and Hat-
chett was given the job of recruit-
ing national press.

Everyone lived happily ever
afier until the Mock Convention
signed up Sen. Dale Bumpers to
speak to the convention delegates.
Someone at WLUR learned of the
MC plans and called Bumpers’ of-
ties to conifrm the facts. The
station’s news department broke
the news sometime before the
MC wanted it known.

Bumpers’ appearance was an-
nounced on a Friday afternoon.
Tuesday night following the an
nouncement by WLUR, Boctsie
Hatchett came to the Ring-tum
Phi office with a hastily-prepared
news release telling us what we al-
ready knew. It turned out the
Media committee had beer reor-
ganized once again and Hatchett
was now in charge of getting out
the news. That is how the commit-
tee stands at present.

Hatchett reports that his other
job. bringing in the press, is still
up in the air to a large extent
right now, and the process o fget-
ting people here is entering what
he calls the “crunch-month.” The
Virginia press will be well-repre-
sented and Hatchett says that peo-
ple he has contacted in the com-
monwealth are helping him con-

tact other journalists.

He said David Broder gave him
some advice on the matter during
the journalist’s visit this year.
Broder told Hatchett not to be too
psyched about having a lot of peo-
ple covering the general cam-
paign showing up here since that
was one of the few weekends be-
fore the California primary comes
off and the campaiga goes wild
{hat the newsmen can spend at
