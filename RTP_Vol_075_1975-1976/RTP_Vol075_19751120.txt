REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Thursday, November 20, 1975

A note on policy

In the past it has been the policy of the Ring-tum Phi to
allow the publication of editorials written by staff members
other than the editor. In keeping with this policy we have
decided to print the following column, written by Joseph Fitz
gerald, one of our assistant news editors, Mr. Fitzgerald has
been the Ring-tum Phi's regular political correspondent, 1.e.
on-the-scene reporter at Executive Committee meetings, for
well over a year. As such he has gained more insight into how
that body governs than nearly any other person on campus.

eht on their part. But for the first time this year that we
can remember, the F.C. met without forming any commit
tees, subcommittees, or study groups to further compound

the problems of a tangled, twisted, overweighted student gov

ernment that is so bureaucratically complex that not even

understand or control it anymore.

So far this vear the E.C. has formed committees to study
tternity house damage, recruitment activities (or lack there
of) by the Student Association for Black Unity, the govern
ent ¢ e Law School student body after they move to
Le Hall, and the formation of a new Minority Co-ordinat
