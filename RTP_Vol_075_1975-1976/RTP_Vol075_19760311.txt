The press

By PHILIP MATCHETT

The men who report the coun-
try’s politics think the press
fell down badly in the 1972
Presidential campaign. They
believe (they)...did compara-
tively well in covering the
Democratic candidate George
McGovern. But they hang their
heads in shame over what they
regard as notably a poor job
in reporting on the Republican
candidate Richard Nixon.

The race for next year’s secre-
tary is being decided in a run-
off today between junior vice-
president Jim Koch and E.C.
junior representative Radar Davis,
a write-in in Monday’s election.

The voter turnout, one of the
largest in recent years, was ex-
panded by a large number of
persons mobilized in the law
school by Hunter’s supporters.
Hunter’s vote alone, 610 to Frank-
lin’s 350, was almost as large as
the total number of voters, about
650, cast in the last Big Three
election. The unusually high num-
ber of votes may also have been
increased by the presence of 175
students in Woods Creek who
were not living on or near campus
last year.

dents got a taste of real polities

of the on-the-air statment, sta-
tion officials extended invitations
to the other two candidates for

the afternoon after Tackas’ talk,
but winner Sandy Stradtman re-
spectfully declined.

The only close race Monday
was the competition for secretary.
Radar Davis joined the race as
a last-minute write-in after de-
ciding not to go after the v.p.
slot, and managed to win only
two fewer votes than Jim Koch.

The E.C. voted Monday night
to allow Davis’ name to be placed
on the ballot in the run-off, even
though he did not formally file
for candidacy by petition. There
is precedent for such a move ac-
cording to Bobby Pugh, and be-

More than a quarter of this

the national men’s average—say
they intend to become lawyers,
according to a 366-college survey

Almost 20 per cent reported
they plan to enter business, slight-

figure for male freshmen, and 16
per cent, more than double the
national average, said they plan
to become physicians or dentists

The proportions are roughly
the same as they have been each
year since 1970. The survey is
taken each fall by the Washing
ton-based American Council of
Education with the cooperation of
the University of California at
Los Angeles, and survey results
are compiled both for every indi
vidual college and for the nation’s
freshmen as a whole. The na
tional averages are broken down
as well by sex, permitting a com
parison of W&L's all-male fresh-
man class with the rest of the
nation’s male freshmen

2 THE RING-TUM PHI

 

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
March 11, 1976

Almost 1000 votes
a new trend?

The election for student body officers turned out to be
quite interesting, after the fact. For a race in which there were
no significant issues a significant portion of the W&L student
body voted, and for that we are delighted. Perhaps we are
finally making some headway against apathy.

Scott Franklin lost to Tom Hunter in the presidential race
by 27 percentage points, a substantial margin. It has been
pointed out to us that not in recent memory has anyone been
on the Executive Committee for three years and then succeed-
ed in a bid for one of the three top spots. While Franklin was
suffering with the flu late last week and his campaigning lag-
ged, a considerable amount of the vote for Hunter must be
seen as an anti-"E.C, major” vote, as another candidate put it.
Hunter parlayed the support of those who like him, those who
dislike the current E.C., and those who dislike Franklin for
one reason or another, into a substantial victory.

The race for the number two seat was extremely interest-
ing. While Sandy Stradtman, an E.C. representative for two
years, won his bid for the position, the anti-establishment sup-
port for “Swede” Takacs was considerable. Takacs, who col-
lected 34% of the vote to Stradtman’s 57%2%, campaigned on
the slogan “Flunk E. C. majors.”

His support came from those who feel the E.C, has lost
touch with the average student, that the same students keep
running for office, and that those who run for office decide
among themselves ahead of time who will run for what posi-
tion. In short, Tackaes’ received the protest vote, against the
system, but mostly against the individuals in the system.

The race for secretary is being decided in a runoff today
between the two front-runners, Jim Koch and “Radar” Davis.
The point to note about Monday's results in this contest is
that Davis received only two votes less than Koch's 331, even
though Davis was a write-in candidate. evidently the voters
did not attach the same stigma to Davis as they did to Frank-
lin and Stradtman, although Davis has been serving on the
K.C. this year. It seems logical that the “anti” vote in this
election was registered in the 26% received by Roger Durham,
whe did not make it to the run-off.

It still bothers us that no sophomores ran for the major
positions, particularly for student body secretary. Next year
will be the first time in over four years that the secretary has
not been a member of the junior class. The class of ‘77 seems
quite political, and it is a safe bet that a large number of those
who lost this week will run for senior [..C. representative on
March 22nd; that election has the potential of becoming a

W&L-style Kentucky Derby,

This was the first set of student body elections since the
opening of the Woods Creek apartments. Although no one
can be sure just what percentage of the Creekers voted, or
which candidates they supported, it is safe to say that the er-
fect of the apartment complex on the turnout was significant,
Those residents constituted a block of 130 voters that were
easily accessible to the candidates during the week of cam-
paigning, and because of their proximity to the main campus a
high portion of their number voted in all likelihood,

All told, 960 students east ballots on Monday, out of an en
rollment of approximately 1000, That converts to exactly 60%,
Ina year when government (at least student government) has
not been held in highest esteem, it is gratifying to note that
00% of the students at WAL even bothered to vote
almost become legendary for our apathic attitude with regard

we have
to the vote. Maybe this is the start of a trend toward more
student involvement in student government, at least one day
a year.

Local citizen replies to allegation

of bias by the Lexington police force

Editor, the Ring-tum Phi:

I am writing in response to a
letter which appeared in the Feb.
26, 1976 edition of the Ring-tum
Phi concerning a questioning of
Lexington’s parking regulations,
signed by Mr. Francis J. Merkel,
Jr. To begin with, I am a resident
of Lexington and am responding
with all due respect for the gen-
eral student body of W&L.

Quoting a portion of Mr.
Merkel’s letter that distresses me:
“It seems that the good citizens
of Lexington often forget who is
(indirectly) responsible for the
very food on their tables.” Here,
he is referring to Lexington de-
pendence upon the existence of
Washington and Lee.

Hopefully, this attitude is not
representative of the W&L stu-
dent body as a whole. Seemingly,
Mr. Merkel has not resided in
this city long enough to realize
the economic complexities that
are characteristic of this area.
The sun does not rise and set
over “Old George” for a great
deal of Lexington’s citizenry.

Assuredly, the working people
of this city and county earn their
livings in a variety of ways (many
of which are in no way associated
with Washington and Lee). And,
as some of you may realize, Rock-
bridge County is presently ex-
periencing the most widespread
recession-related unemployment
of any area in the state of Vir-
ginia. Of course this problem
would be even more severe with-
out Washington and Lee. But who
provides the food for those who
have been laid off from their jobs?

In the midst of all this we see
no outward financial problem be-
setting W&L. May I suggest that
Lexington’s problems, advantages,
and population be examined by
those people who have criticisms
so they may become familiarized
with the community before draw-
ing conclusions.

Also, I am not aware of any
conspriacy aimed at W&L stu-
dents on the part of the Lexington
police force, an accusation which
appeared in Mr. Merkel’s letter.
Lexington has a reputation for
having one of the lowest crime
rates of any city of comparable
size in the country. Someone is
then obviously doing something
right.

As a resident for several years,
I too have been ticketed on oc-
casion for breaking city parking
regulations. Even though they did
seem like trivial matters to me as
well, I did break the law. I saw no
acknowledgement of that fact any-
where in Mr. Merkel’s letter. Up-

Tim Bays
well worth

By FRITZ GOLDBERG
Music Editor-at-large

I hardly paid attention when
someone told me last fall that
the SAB was going to be bring-
ing live music to the Cockpit. At
the time, the only time the Cock-
pit brought any serious thought
from my addled skull was when
I pondered the beer prices and
their relation to Gerry Ford's
economic program.

But that was before I sat down
in the Pit one night and began
talking to a stand-up comic with
a guitar, That was before a morose
and started not getting along with
flutist sat down behind the piano
the SAB. That was before a good
old boy from Yonkers and a couple
from lLforget-where spread their
musical word through the Cock-
pit.

So why did I write all those
and why am I writing this one?
Because when someone makes any
noise more blatant than a drunken
grunt in the Pit, it is time some-
one sat up and paid attention.
This especially true of Tim Bays.

This is no drunken grunt we
are hearing through the SAB’s
fancy sound system this week.
This is a Bacchic scream, a per-
former who has something to say
to all those out there who would

on breaking a law one must be
willing to pay the consequences,
naturally.

If Mr. Merkel is perhaps dis-
appointed with the law as it now
stands, then I suggest he take the
matter up with our mayor (a
W&L professor) or members of
Lexington’s city council (several
are directly associated with Wash-
ington and Lee).

It is becoming more apparent
that Mr. Merkel did indeed violate
the law. As a matter of fact he
might be classified as an habitual
offender. Perhaps, he is flattering
himself by claiming that the police
department is following a policy
of harassment of W&L students.
I think it was just a question of
being in the wrong place at the
wrong time one too many times.

The people of this city are not
to blame, nor is the police de-
partment. Mr. Merkel, you your-
self are to blame for not taking
a little extra time by placing the
nickel in the parking meter or
parking in the proper direction.
There would not be any problem
at all if you had acted within the
law in the first place.

Another point deserves atten-
tion too. Mr. Merkel insinuated
that the Lexington city police
were not providing equal treat-
ment for the city’s inhabitants
overall. However, Mr. Merkel’s
explanation for his failure to pay
one of his parking tickets on
time was due to the fact that he
was a W&L student, had a tight
schedule (it was in the middle of
a mid-term week), and _ thus
couldn’t concern himself with
such trivial matters (it slipped his
mind). Well, such a matter may
seem trivial to him but I am sure
that the people who make their
living by enforcing the law might
not agree.

What I find incredible though,
is that the gist of Mr. Merkel’s
letter was the lack of “liberty
and justice for all,” yet he acts
as though he should deserve
special consideration or special
attention in not being able to
pay his fine on time simply be-
cause of his tight schedule at
W&L. What would have happened
if he would have had to appear
in court? Did Mr. Merkel bother
to inform the police department
concerning his schedule conflict?
Maybe they would have under-
stood the problem and offered a
suggestion. A “tight schedule” is
not a legitimate excuse.

I get the impresion though, that
basically the problem is one of
a lack of understanding. Certain-
ly, one’s college experience in-

rather laugh about the back seat
of a ‘57 Chevy than talk about it
in mixed company. This is a
man with a good deal of social
comment of the sort W&L men
should appreciate, a musician
with music that acknowledges
that the back seat and “green
beer” have a place in the Ameri-
ean culture,

And lest I forget that I am
supposed to be a critic of music
and not culture, and that Tim
Bays sings about more than back
seats, I should add that the
music is very good as music, as
well as social comment.

Bays has a monologue that laces
through his songs, a monologue
that slices through everything
from grandpa’s suicide to his
sweetheart’s wig, a running train
of anecdotal and commentative
humor that picks you up by your
psychic bootstrap and carries you
to a spot several segments re-
moved from where you were a
minute ago.

And lest we forget that this man
is supposed to be a musician, you
notice that the monologue would
be a monotone if there were not
something there to add to the
words, to embellish the stream of
thoughts. There it is, resting on
his leg, a guitar that surpasses

volves more than what is learned
in the classroom. “College ex-
perience” implies a maturing in
attitude regarding associations
with one’s fellow man. Not just
with fellow students, but also a
genuine attempt at building an
understanding of those outside
the immediate realm of associa-
tion within the community. An
attitude of narrow-mindedness
can only have a damaging effect
on school-community relations. It
is a two-sided affair and all who
are involved must learn to bend
a little.

However, after reading such
drastic statements in Mr. Merkel's
letter I must respectfully resent
any inference on his part of (even
indirect) superiority regarding my
dependence on him or Washing-
ton and Lee for my well-being.
Certainly, W&L has always been
a significant asset to this com-
munity and without its presence
Lexington would exist in a wholly
different capacity than its current
state. But it would exist, and I
am sure there would still be
enough food to go around.

Again, I am writing with all due
respect for Washington and Lee
and the student body. Thank you
very much.

Sincerely,
Michael Patrick St. Clair

Editor’s reply:

Agreed, W&L does not put the
food on the table for everyone in
the Lexington-Rockbridge area,
although a significant portion of
the economy is tied to the Uni-
versity (which, by the way, does
have its share of financial prob-
lems).

Agreed also that one must be
willing to accept the consequences
of one’s actions. We believe that
Mr. Merkel was not attempting to
relieve himself of any guilt, but
was questioning the rationale be-
hind the zoning of the street on
which he resides for two-hour
parking only.

Because he has received two
tickets does not make Mr. Merkel
an “habitual offender”; if two
summons constitute evidence of
a habit, you yourself could be so
classified.

The question is not whether a
law was broken or who is to
blame, but why the law exists in
its present form. We must admit
that at times we are at odds to
reason why parking regulations
are what they are. An example:
The zoning of Lee Avenue be-
tween Washington and Nelson
Streets. Perhaps a council mem-
ber could explain to Mr. Merkel

is a Cockpit musician
listening to for awhile

most anything we've heard in the
Cockpit this year, following the
man’s fingers through the strang-
est twists and turns and then slid-
ing into the scheme of things
when the man gets around to
singing a song, or finishing the
one he’s working on.

Now do you understand what
the music of Tim Bays is doing
in the Cockpit? Do you under-
stand what this itinerant folkie
is all about? Somehow, | didn't
think you would. But at least
you can go into the Cockpit with
a little bit of background and
perhaps enjoy the music a little
more. And when you applaud,
stop and ask yourself what you're
clapping for, or what you're laugh-
ing at, and maybe you'll enjoy the
performance just a little bit more.

Bays will be performing in the
Cockpit this evening at 5:15 and
at 9 p.m. Tomorrow and Saturday
performances are scheduled for
7, 9, and 10:30 p.m,

the reasoning behind the Me-
Dowell Street zoning. Perhaps we
should attempt to write a feature
article, so that students may
understand the problem of zoning
and be more sympathetic to the
city.

As for police harassment,
while it is not the rule, there
have been incidents of which we
have knowledge that could be at-
tributed to harassment, by police
of students and vice versa, (Lex-
ington’s crime rate is so low that
its policemen have time to seek
out all parking offenders or just
cruise around.) We hope that those
incidents were just _ isolated
events, and that the Lexington
police force is even-handed in
its administraion of justice.

March 2, 1976
Editor, the Ring-tum Phi:

This past weekend I had the
pleasure of attending the Faney
Dress Ball at W&L. The decora-
tions, bands, entertainment, and
refreshments were excellent, and
the whole theme was carried out
to perfection. | had a great time,
and would like to congratulate
the Student Activities Board on
a job well done.

I have one complaint, however,
and hope that the Board will take
it inte consideration next year.
I did not think that beer, or any
other beverage should have been
allowed on the dance floor, Drink-
ing should have been limited to
the table areas, only. It was ex-
tremely messy, and when every-
one is dressed in tuxedos and
gowns, | do not think that there
should have been the risk of hav-
ing someone slosh his drink all
over another person. It reminded
me of a grain party, and spoiled
the otherwise beautiful setting
Perhaps the clean-up committee
would agree with me that the
beer and other drinks should
have remained at the tables.

Thank you,
Sheila A. Buck

N.C. State, Duke trounced

By BILL FLESHER

Imagine that Washington and
Lee’s season opening lacrosse
games had been played on friend-
ly Wilson Field rather than on
Tobacco Road last week.

Think what the scene would
have been as the Generals got
their first goal of the year. On
the field the players congratulate
the goal-scorer. In the stands, the
fans, among other things, strike
up a chorus of the W&L Swing.

And from the pressbox comes
the announcement of the goal:

“Generals’ goal scored by num-
ber 24, (pause), Tom Keigler???”

Seeing may have made believ-
ing easier, but it really did

happen. It was the junior de-
fenseman Keigler—not Donny

Carroll or Rob Morgan or even
Charlie Brown—who opened the
scoring in W&L’s 20-3 romp over
North Carolina State Friday.

Not to be outdone, senior All
American defenseman Rob Lind-
sey retaliated with a goal of his
own the next day as the Generals
walloped Duke, 19-8.

Neither of the lopsided wins
was unexpected, since North Caro-
lina State and Duke are regarded

as the weakest of the Atlantic
Coast Conference lacrosse teams.

Eighteen W&L players hit the
scoring column in the two games,
led by junior midfielder Jack
Dudley’s nine goals and two
assists.

Dudley, who totalled just 14
points last season, scored five
goals and two assists against the
Wolfpack ,and came back with
four goals against Duke.

Senior attackman Donny Carroll
took the team points lead with
four goals and nine assists (five
against N.C. State) in the two
games.

The Generals took a 3-0 first
quarter lead against N.C. State
on goals by Keigler, Jay Sindler,
and Charlie Stieff.

They stretched the margin to
6-1 at intermission, the sixth goal
coming on a Rob Morgan shot
just one second before the period
ended.

W&L then scored six straight
goals in the third quarter, three
of them by Dudley, before the
Wolfpack’s Mike Cunningham
could get State’s second goal.

After trading scores early in
the final period, the Generals reel-

Who’s playing where

A position-by-position look at
the 1976 Generals:

Attack: W&L wil carry seven
attackmen this year, all of whom
Emmer says can contribute.

The attack will be centered
around tri-captain seniors Donny
Carroll and Rob Morgan, the
team’s top two scorers in 1975.

Carrol! (85 points last year; 185
during his career) earned third-
team All-American honor last
year. Known as one of the best
“feeders” in the nation, Carroll
will continue to work from be-
hind the goal while Morgan (53
goals and 78 points in 1975) will
again play crease attack, although
Emmer did not rule out the pos-
sibility of Morgan moving behind
on certain occasions.

Emmer says that freshman Jeff
Fritz will fill the hole created by
the graduation of Dave Warfield.
A quick and aggressive player,
Fritz should give W&L an ex-
ceptional riding game.

Emmer will also have freshman
John Black and sophomore Sandy
Bishop available as behind attack
help, while senior Jim Englehart
(nine goals last year) and junior
Boyd Martin (eight goals, in-
cluding five against Duke) will
back up Morgan.

Midfield: At season’s end last
year, the only midfielder who
wasn’t expected to be back this
vear was Ken Miller, who gradu-
ated five days after the Maryland
game

Since then, however, transtes
and the plain old desire to sit
out the season has cost W&L
seven middies, including the
“Manhasset” line of Scott and
Ralph Baugher and Jay Mona
han, and faceoff specialist Brent
Miller

Many W&L lacrosse followers
are worried about a lack of ex-
perience at midfield, And, as
Emmer admits, the midfield was
the biggest question mark area
before practice began

The most experienced midfield
consists of junior Jack Dudley and
sophomore Jay Sindler and Char
lie Stieff. Dudley (14 points in
each of his two seasons) is a two
vear starter who Emmer calls
one of the steadiest players on
the team.”

Sindler, who possesses the hard
est shot on the team, could de
velop into a premier offensive
threat. according to Emmer, who
ealls Stieff (the leading ground
ball man at midfield last year
with 90) “W&L’'s best defensive
middie.”

\ second unit is made up of
ophomore Mark Derbyshire and
freshmen Bryan Sibson and Chris
Kearney, a converted crease at
tackman. Derbyshire and Kearney

Flannery. Freshmen Jim Babcock

make the W&L varsity, are a

the faceoff work. He did not indi

will be a face

off specialist this year as was the
case with Miller last season.

None of this includes Chris
Larson, W&L’s sixth leading
scorer last year with 20 points,
who will join the team within a
week of the end of the basketball
season. It would be safe to say
that Larson will find a spot in the
top three midfields.

Defense: With five of the top
six defensemen returning from
last year’s squad, W&L’s reputa-
tion as a strong defensive club
should be continued.

All three starters are back —
first-team All-American Rob Lind-
sey, third-team A-A Tom Keigler,
and crease defenseman John
Strock.

Lindsey, who, like Carroll, is
in his second year as a tri-captain,
will again draw the assignment
of stopping an opponent’s high
scorer, according to Emmer.

The senior defenseman is best
remembered for his performances
against John Hopkins, in which
he shut out two allegedly un-
stoppable attackmen, Jack
Thomas in 1974, and Mike O'Neill
last year.

While Lindsey is known for his
man-to-man play, Keigler is re-
cognized as the best stick-handl-
ing defenseman in the country.

“He’s the best I’ve ever seen,”
says Emmer of the junior’s ability
to handle the ball. Keigler has
led the Generals in ground balls
in each of his two seasons at
W&L (107 in 1974; 188 last year).

While Lndsey and Keigler get
much-deserved publicity, Strock
gets little if any. But as Emmer
and Strock’s running mates
argue, almost everyone is over-
looking a very talented lacrosse
player.

“John is a very steady player
who does everything’ well,”
Emmer says. “There is no doubt
in my mind that John is a better
player than some of the other
defensemen in the nation who
get a lot more publicity than he
does.”

The defensive talent does not
end with starters. Emmer says
that junior Steve White and senior

Dave (call him Weeb) Eubank
will see extensive action
Emmer indicated that White

and Eubank may anchor a de-
fensive midfield, a tactic the Gen
erals used quite successfully
against Johns Hopkins in last
year’s NCAA playoff game

Also an the squad are two
freshmen defensemen Jack
Wileox (from Atlanta, another
new locale for a W&L lacrosse
player) and Ed Grandes, who will
miss several games with a muscle
problem in his lower back

Goal: In sophomore Charlie
Brown, W&L has not only one of
the best netminders in the nation
but also a true offensive threat
who spends most of his time in
side the crease

Brown's 75-yard goal against
Johns Hopkins will undoubtedly
eo down as one of the great
moments in W&L sports history
However don't expect too many
long-range bombs this year

Opposing coaches came to re
spect Brown for his ability to
move the ball down the fleld last
vear. He came close to scoring
several times on full-field clears

ed off seven goals to record their
highest one quarter goal output
since 1974 (11 against Franklin
and Marshall).

It was much the same story the
next day. W&L grabbed another
early lead (5-0 at the quarter) and
controlled the rest of the penalty-
filled game (11 against Duke;
seven against W&L).

Dudley picked up three goals
before halftime (11-3), while Car-
roll tallied two of his three goals
in the third quarter.

Duke’s Mike Heldeman match-
ed Dudley with four goals.

W&L goalie Charlie Brown was
sharp in both games, with 18
saves against North Carolina State
and 13 in less than three quarters
of play against Duke.

As for W&L’s offensive defense-
men, Keigler scored his first goal
for W&L on a hard shot after a
full-field clear against N.C. State.

Some players, however, say
Lindsey’s goal was not a shot but
a pass to Morgan on the crease.

Lindsey would not comment on
the matter, saying only, “It went
in, didn’t it?”

Meanwhile, John Strock, the
third starting defenseman, says

and why

Emmer says that Brown is well
ahead of where he was last sea-
son. He adds that the sophomore
has finally made the adjustment
to college lacrosse, which Brown
admitted last year is “just a little
bit different than the high school
game.”

Backing Brown up are junior
Bill Cole and soph Julian (from
New Orleans) Good, both of
whom played junior varsity la-
crosse last year.

he’ll get his goal in due time.

W&L takes on the powerful
Mount Washington Lacrosse Club
in Baltimore Saturday.

The Wolfpack is the defending
club lacrosse champion. Their
roster is not dotted but filled with
All-Americans.

Several W&L lacrosse alumni
are playing for Mount Washing-
ton this year, including Dave
Warfield, Bryan Chasney, Sam
Englehart, and Skip Lichtfuss.

The Wolfpack stopped Virginia

in their season opener last week,
17-9.

“Butch” ran effective campaign

In a system where the monet-,
ary matters of a committee are
handled by the _ vice-president
(which gives him something bet-
ter to do than wait for the presi-
dent to kick off) it takes a coura-
geous man to run for the post of
“treasurer.” But Butch Clark was
up to the job and managed to
run one of the most successful
campaigns in recent Washington

and Lee history, striking down all
opponents to win the seat he
sought by a 15 vote margin.
Butch, born Ivan Edward in
1955 (but was like any good W&L
man, unable to live with the name
Ivan), is an English major from
Chevy Chase, Md. who did not
campaign very hard, as some of
his opponents tended to do, be-
cause he thought students were

Committee, the major reason they
failed was because McGovern was
not taken seriously in the media
in the Spring of ’72.

The other aspect of the national
press is coverage of the conven-
tion itself. The media department
of the Mock Convention is trying
to have press representatives on
hand to follow the May event. The
convention media people are tell-
ing correspondents that their col-
legiate work is the most accurate
in the Nation. So far, the re-
sponse has been better than in
past years. The reason for this
change lies in the new attitude
of reporters, as Ms. Toni Roades,
Press Secretary for the Demo-
cratic National Committee said,
“The Mock Convention is what
correspondents are searching for,
a reliable exercise that tries to
play like a real conventions works.
It will be popular with the press
because it is not a poll.”
