Faculty abolishes
Washington Break

By THE NEWS STAFF

At its regular December meet-
ing the faculty voted to strike
the Washington Holiday from the
1967-77 academic calendar.

The vote followed the presenta-
tion of three proposals submitted
by the University Council, which
had discussed the topic at length
in its meeting on November 19.

The faculty E.C. had recom-
mended to the University Council
that next year’s Washington Holi-
day last 9 days and come after
8 weeks. The student E.C. asked
that a 9-day break come after
6 weeks. The Student Activities
Board wanted a 4-day break. The
Athletic Department preferred

Several student residences were
the scenes of burglaries over the
Christmas break and _ several
checks have been forged both on
campus and in Lexington stores
over the past few months.

Both problems are being in-
vestigated at present by Univer-
sity officials and the local police.

The burglaries occurred at lo-
cations on McCorkle Ave., sev-
eral apartments on Jefferson St.,
and the large Gothic abomination
known as the Munster House.

The burglars took mostly stereo
equipment and calculators and
stole at least $2500 worth of
merchandise at the Munster loca-
tion alone.

According to one of the victims,
Doug Muir, police are checking

E.C. meeting tranquil

By THE NEWS STAFF
The Executive Committee of
the Student Body took a serious
break from legislative activity
Monday night, taking a calm mo-
ment to look over their accomp-
lishments of the last weeks of the
fall term and to look ahead to
upcoming matters of great im-
portance such as the spring town-
gown meeting, the coming of
Truman Capote, and the ninety
minutes preceding Super Bowl X.
Freshman reprsentative Billy
Webster was astounded to learn
that the wise and elder senior
members of the committee could
give him no significant answer to
his question of what would be
done on a mammoth hour-and-a
half program scheduled to precede
the Super Bowl
During the last E.C. meeting
before the Thanksgiving break,
the committee voted to form the
Minority Affairs Co-ordinating
Committee, and gave the Student
Association for Black Unity $1000
to bring Tommy Scott Young, a
black poet-jazzman, to campus

no break at all.

Members of the U.C. expressed
varying sentiments, Dr. Jay Cook
suggested having no break and
ending school a week earlier in
May, arguing that this would help
students economically. Seniors
Scott Stevenson and Keith Crocker
said that the students needed a
break to relieve mental stress.
Junior Ken Voelker pointed out
that a 9-day break forced out-
of-state students to go home and
incur an unnecessary expense.

John Gunn said that moving
graduation forward by a week
might mean that the senior class
could not graduate with the law
seniors. Dr. John DeVogt added
that financial aid students were
burdened by the many breaks.

Six motions were made during
the U.C. meeting, three of which
passed. Voelker’s resolution that
the break last for 4 days was
adopted 15-6. Crocker’s motion
that this break occur during the
seventh week passed 12-4. The
Council also approved 9-5 junior
Woody Woodell’s motion that the
9-day break proposed by the fac-
ulty E.C. come after six weeks.

it, having raised more money than
any other contender. The Jack-
son campaign strategy is handled
by Director Bob Keefe (no rela-
tion to W&L’s Director of Public
Information) and National Co-
ordinator Bill Brawley.

The Jackson brain trust has
two basic goals: refining the po-
litical time clock so as to rise
in early June and serve as the
alternative to George Wallace.

According to staff members, the
campaign is right on schedule.

Brawley is a veteran of
presidential campaigns and he
looks it. With cold eyes and a
cigarette constantly dangling from
his mouth, the South Carolinian
looks like the worst results from
a voter opinion poll. Speaking
from a cluttered office that was
once a bedroom of a two-story
home on 2nd Street, Brawley said
he was not worried about winning
or losing in the first primaries.
“This is a race of staying power
The candidate who has the stay-
ine power, and that means some
popularity but mainly the money
to pay the bills the first week
of June, is likely to be the one

“There are three or four men
in New Hampshire (Jackson is not
running there, but sticking pri
inarily to the large industrial
tates) who are almost in a dead
heat, and in a frantie effort to

come out first spend their last
dollar. And after that they are
out of money ... so I think
you will find a drastic drop off
after the New Hampshire and
Massachusetts primaries.”

After Massachusetts Jackson
will concentrate efforts on the 540
delegates to be won on June 8
in California, New Jersey and
Ohio.

To pose as an alternative to
Governor George Wallace, Jack-
son will emphasize the economy

Capote signed
for appearance

here in March
By THE NEWS STAFF

Truman Capote has been signed
for the Contact °76 symposium.
He will appear on March 15 and
speak on American literature and
give readings from his three
books, Answered Prayer, Break-
fast at Tiffany's, and In Cold
Blood,

He may also give readings from
a book scheduled for publication
in February. Capote’s appearance
also follows closely on the heels
of a movie in which the noted
author and playwright will make
his first appearance as an actor
instead of a director.

Capote’s appearance was made
possible by a last minute grant
of $1000 from the E.C. The money
given was $1100 less than Contact
co-chairman Bill Flesher’s or iginal
request.

Capote will be speaking in the
gymnasium the same week as the
visits of author George Plimpton
and Chicago 8 attorney William
Kunstler, Kunstler will speak on
the subject of civil rights, a field
in which he has argued several
controversial cases in recent
years. The lawyer will appear on
March 16, preceding Plimpton on

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Thursday, January 8, 1976

Now you see it,

now you don’t

Using logic even Aristotle would have difficulty following,
the faculty at its regular December meeting decided to
abolish the mid-winter break, at least for the '76-’77 year.
Rather than earning the displeasure of any small segment of
the student body that would have been disappointed with the
timing of the break no matter when it would have been
scheduled, our professors have chosen to dispense with the
holiday altogether, possibly earning the displeasure of all
students,

True, without the vacation it will be no problem for the
sciences to schedule the required number of labs, the athletic
department will have no difficulty in arranging home games,
and we students will arrive home one week earlier in May.

What concerns us is that there will be no break in the
monotony of twelve solid weeks of academics during the
most dreary part of the year. Many students we know had
enough difficulty in retaining their sanity during the long
haul preceding Thankskiving, a long haul at least punctuated
with a few diversions such as Homecoming and Parents’
Weekend, With only Fancy Dress to enliven the bleak winter
months, the second term could be transformed into a more
formidable period than it already is. Students will have more
difficulty working efficiently throughout the term.

There was much discussion preceding the vote on whether
to retain the break as it occurs this year, or to alter it in
some fashion, There were proposals to shorten it to two
school days, to keep it at its present length but place it in
March, and to use a combination of the two. Some people
thought a week too long; others saw no sense in a half-week
holiday. Some thought there was much to be said for leaving
the break in February, after mid-terms; others felt placement
near the end of the term would help students gather their
strength for a last lusty push toward examination.

Confronted with this bewildering array of opinions, the
laculty was stymied. So rather than take sides in the issue,
it chose to withdraw the issue altogether, ruling out the
inclusion of any vacation during next year's winter term. The
logic behind this action is obscure, if existent.

Twelve weeks plus one week of exams is an awfully long
time to work diligently at studies, without at least a mo-
mentary pause to catch our breath, We sincerely believe that
the faculty has erred, We personally saw nothing dreadfully
wrong with the short winter break of years past—at any rate
we feel that there is a definite psychological need for a holiday
partway through the term. The faculty's action was taken in
the name of expediency, and it resolved the Great Calendar
Debate, temporarily, We nevertheless question the wisdom of
the decision.

S.C.Y,

Outside the classroom

there are opportunities

It may almost seem impossible, but we are nearly half way
through another academic year. The holiday went by too
quickly, and we find ourselves suddenly confronted with a
iresh set of courses, after having just dispatched with the last
batch (or so it seems),

With the new term getting into full swing, we should stop
for a moment and reflect on what we are trying to accomplish
with our time here, Sure, we all attend classes and parties,
but what else are we doing? Have we gotten involved in
those organizations we “keep meaning to join”? Are we doing
anything more than just drifting through, studying as little
as possible but really learning much less than even that?

Most groups active on the campus would welcome new
inembers heartily right now—some need more participants
just to continue funetioning properly, Several worthwhile
etivities that come to mind inelude the Mock Convention,
the University Federation, music and drama groups, and of
course publications,

We should strive to develop ourselves as completely as
possible during our college years. Involvement in outside
ictivities should be an integral part of this development. Is it?

Valiant waitress
foils catsup heist

Several students dressed in
plain clothes were foiled in an
attempt to make Mother's restaur-
ant the scene of an end-of-term
larceny, when a determined un-
identified waitress smashed their
bizarre scheme in an admirable
display of swift thinking, courage,
integrity, and luck.

Several students were observed
departing said pizzeria on the 12th
of December. They were running
stealthily toward their getaway
vehicle at the corner of Jefferson
and Washington Streets, and mak-
ing a great deal of noise to draw
the attention of passersby away

Lexington’s
leash law

All students and other mem-
bers of the Washington and Lee
community who may own dogs
are reminded of the Lexington
City Code concerning the licens-
ing and control of dogs. Par-
ticular attention is called to the
new leash law which was passed
by the City Council in April 1975.

All dogs six months old and
over must be properly licensed
and must wear a “collar bearing
a license tag of the proper
calendar year.” Dog licenses for
the City of Lexington may be
obtained from the Office of the
City Treasurer on East Wash-
ington Street; fines are prescrib-
ed for failure to pay the license
tax.

In addition, dogs are not to be
allowed to run at large; they
must be under the control of the
owner or custodian by means of
a leash, chain, or rope when off
the owner’s property. Section 4-6
of the City Code provides the fol-
lowing:

“It shall be unlawful for any
dog to run at large in the City
of Lexington. For the purpose
of this section, a dog shall be
deemed to run at large while
roaming, running, or self-hunt-
inf off the property of its
owner or custodian and not
under its owner’s or custodian’s
immediate control by leash,
chain, rope or other restrain-
ing device securely attached to
the dog’s harness or collar.”
Fines, in the minimum amount
of five dollars for the first offense
and twenty-five dollars for each
subsequent offense, are prescribed
for violations of this ordinance.

If violations of these require-
ments of the Lexington City Code
continue to occur with frequency
on University property the re-
mainder of the academic year, the
City dog warden will be invited
to the campus periodically, with-
out prior notification, to impound
unlicensed dogs and dogs found
to be “running at large.”

Study skills
course offered

As a service to Washington and
Lee students, the University has
once again this year engaged
Baldridge Reading and Study
Skills, Inc. to offer on campus a
special program designed to im-
prove reading and learning skills
in academic subjects.

The program is not merely a
speed-reading course. Its techni-
ques are designed to increase
reading speed, to strengthen com-
prehension, to improve recall, to
sustain concentration and to
deepen analysis. A student uses
his own classroom reading ma-
terals rather than mass-prepared
instructional literature and me-
chanical training aids.

This program will be conducted
on the Washington and Lee cam-
pus by an instructor from Bald-
ridge Reading from January 12
through February 6. Scheduling
will be flexible to accommodate
individual student schedules, and
classes will be small to permit
necessary individual attention.
Each student will attend a total
of twenty sessions, five per week.
Tuition for the program will be
$75, payable by the start of the
program upon receipt of a state-
ment from Baldridge.

Further intormation and regi-
stration cards may be obtained
from the Office of the Dean of
Students, Washington Hall 25.
Interested students should regis-
ter for the course as soon as
possible,

from the catsup bottle one of the
criminals had perfidiously swiped
from an unsuspecting table.

The quick thinking waitress
copied the license number of the
offending vehicle as it sat in the
middle of the intersection with
its driver desperately attempting
to start it.

As the robbers ran about in
the street, some pushing the ve-
hicle, some perusing the area
beneath the hood and hypothisiz-
ing learnedly, the waitress boldly
strode up to the villain holding
the catsup bottle and siezed it
from him in no uncertain terms.

Although the local constabulary
had been summoned, the culprits
managed to get the vehicle start-
ed at last, spraying the area sur-
rounding the intersection with a
near-fatal cloud of carbon mon-
oxide and gravel dust.

When asked about the condi-
tion of the delinquents involved
in the foiled attempt, the waitress
replied that, “They were all drunk
as Hell.”

When asked about what police
action she expected as a result
of the incident, she speculated
that the law might also be in a
state of inebriation on the eve-
ning in question.

Dear Traveller: 1 am a freshman and am somewhat confused as to
how to get good grades in some courses. Do you have any hints?

Signed, G.P.A. 0.01

Dear Academic Pro: I really can’t give you much help—the ways of
the wild and of the profs are beyond me. However, never let it
be said that Traveller won't try. Here are some clues I gathered
while in the Co-op one day disguished as a three-legged canine.

Art 100—Let it be known that you adore Helen Reddy.
Economics 102—Keep using Drop/Add forms until you get the

right one.

Economics 219—Smoke a pipe.

Music 151—Whistle Beethoven's Fifth when you pass him on the
walk, and sit next to Shills at concerts.

Politics 230—Get to know Mrs. Miller.

History 150—Join S.A.B.U. (a slight problem for some).

History 354—Purge yourself of your Southern drawl.

Anthropology 101—Go out for the team, you fool. If you don’t
play just carry a stick around with you.

Mathematics 102—Wear bobby-socks.

Military Science 102—Transfer to V.M.I.

Geology 120—Learn to play banjo and frequent the Paramount.

Philosophy 208—Fall asleep on the Front Campus while con-

templating the Sun.

Greek 102—Go to the Toga Party.
Chemistry 101—Get your fraternity to nominate your date for

Homecoming Queen.

Chemistry 241—Sorry, fella, there’s no hope here.
French 112—Bleach your hair blond and smoke Eric cigarettes.
Drama 133—Make sure one of your friends is taking a course

in directing.

Biology 110—In lab carry a surfing magazine and a Beach Boys
album; at least one prof will be pleased.
Journalism 102—Throw a brick at the editor of the Ring-tum

Phi.
Chinese 101—Squint.

Letters to the editor

Student finds Thymes

appalling ...
Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

Upon reading the second issue
of the “‘W&L Thymes” I was even
more appalled than I was after
I read the first issue. Articles con-
taining phrases like “Amerika,”
“corporate pigs,” and ‘“macho-
boozo-frat-dubyanel trip facade”
belong somewhere else — any-
where else — besides the W&L
campus.

The typical W&L gentleman is
lambasted owing to his dress,
speech, social concerns, etc., while
the obvious minority is represent-
ed as the norm on campus.

Funds must not be appropriat-
ed for this “alternative” news-
paper. Funding a newspaper that
appeals to such an obvious mi-
nority would constitute reverse
discrimination as well as be
utterly foolish. A rag depicting
W&L in such a light has no place
on this campus. It is truly my
hope that this “thing” ceases
functioning before any prospec-
tive students obtain copies of it
and judge the merits of W&L by
it.

Respectfully,
Scott M. Stevenson, Esq., "76A

. . . but then, doesn’t
everybody?
Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:
Enclosed is a copy of a letter I
sent to the Thymes. Since this
past issue of the Thymes is prob-
ably the last we will see of it, I
would appreciate it if you would
print the letter in the Phi.
November 21, 1975
To the Editors and Staff of the
Thymes
Dear Sirs:
GROW UP OR GIVE UP
After I had read the first issue
of the Thymes, I had hoped that
it would die of natural causes.
Unfortunately, it did not; the
second issue only goes to confirm
my belief that it should have.
Your “seasoned look at Washing-
ton and Lee”’—which you so wit-
tily call it—is nothing more than
a piece of sophomoric trash.
Your stated purpose is “to bring
before the W&L community the
pertinent issues of today.” Do
you really think that Ms. Kellum’s
sugarcoated account of her peril-
ous trek to the Beta house is
“pertinent?” I am glad, however,
to know that Ms. Kellum and the
Betas lived happily ever after.
And what o% your “on-the-spot
look at W&L’s fairer neighbors?”
I fail to see anything of value in
these adolescent “reports.” Look
at the pretentious sociological
jargon you have used to conceal
what is really a sick and in-
fantile obsession with sex: “When
asked a leading question about
the development of a sexual re-
lationship after the third or fourth
date, about 15% of the girls said
simply ... “—igle, giggle, ed
nauseam.” In short, it seems as
though your writers have just
reached puberty, and are pres-
ently engaged in journalistic mas-
turbation
I do have some complimentary

things to say about the Thymes,
Rick McHan’s article, “W&L
Drama,” was well written and in-
formative, as was Mark Mendel’s,
“The Real World: New York City.”
But this type of writing does not
need the Thymes. The Ring-tum
Phi and Ariel are both available
for such writing—although I am
not sure that the Ariel staff would
accept the immature prose and
poetry that have appeared in the
Thymes.

As for your present financial
difficulties, I have absolutely no
sympathy. Fools and their money
are soon parted.

Former editor likes

“excellent” editorial
Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

My compliments to you, Sir, for
your excellent and thought pro-
voking editorial in your Novem-
ber 13 issue!

The Honor System has been
one of the glories of Washington
and Lee for over a century. A
man either is honorable or he
isn’t—there is no middle ground.

We have seen the sorry spectacle
of a President of the United
States forced to resign by public
opinion because he lied about
things which he felt were “a
second rate burglary.” The fact
was he lied. There was no matter
of degree.

I hope that the W&L students
of today are not immersed in the
cynicism of the market place and
the United Nations. As leaders
of tomorrow, respect for and
governance by the Honor System,
will furnish the basis of life long
self respect and happiness in life.

As a former Editor of the Ring-
tim Phi I read it with interest
and congratulate you for publish-
ing a newsy, well balanced paper
under the trying conditions of
1975!

With best wishes, I am,

Sincerely yours,
Emmett W. MacCorkle Jr. ’26

 

Letters-to-the-Editor are always
welcome. They should be in good
taste, refer Lo campus issues, avoid
excessive length and present a co-
herent point of view.

Basketball’s record slips to 3-3

BY SAMMY THOMPSON

Washington and Lee’s basket-
ball team opened their season
November 28 and 29 with vic-
tories over Washington College
and York College of Pennsylvania
by identical 86-67 scores. After
that, however, the Generals lost
three in a row before beating
St. Leo’s College December 18.

In the season opener against
York, coach Verne Canfield start-
ed 5-10, sophomore Bob Forlenza
and 6-2, senior John Podgajny at
the guards while 6-4, junior Chris
Larson and 6-5, senior Jeff Baum
started at the forward positions.
At center was 6-8, senior Norm
Kristoff.

The Generals got the lead early
in the York game as Larson hit
on several jump shots. The big-
gest margin of the half came
after eight minutes of playing
time had elapsed, giving W&L a
20-10 lead. Junior Bob Flint came
off the bench to grab nine first-
half rebounds while Larson led
in scoring with 14 points. York

narrowed the W&L lead to four
points with five minutes remain-
ing in the half. At intermission,
the Generals managed to stay on
top 38-37.

The second half started slowly
for the Generals as they missed
shots and committed several turn-
overs. York scored four points in
a row to take a 47-52 lead with
17 minutes remaining in the

game. York’s lead did not last
long, however, as W&L’s 6-8
center, Norm Kristoff, hit six

straight points to bring the Gen-
erals back. After this, W&L led
the rest of the game.

Larson, Baum and freshman
Dave Leunig spurred the Gen-
erals’ attack the rest of the
game. Bob Flint did a good job
for the Generals off the bench
winding up with 13 rebounds and
6 points. Larson was the game’s
leading scorer with 25 points.

The General’s second game of
the season against Washington
College gave W&L its second win
in an exciting contest in which
coach Canfield was slapped with

two technical fouls following the
injury of junior guard, Kim Sims.
The incident occurred when Sims
fell while dribbling down court.
A Washington College player
stole the ball as Sims lay on
the floor in agony. Canfield pro-
tested to the official that play
should have been halted when the
injury occurred. The official con-
tinued play, however, and Can-
field drew a technical foul after
his heavy protest. Afterwards, in
the locker room, it was determin-
ed that Sims had fractured the
middle finger on his left hand.

As coach Canfield sat on the
sidelines with two technicals,
W&L went on to outplay WC
and led at the half 35-30. The
game was tied in the second half
at 35-35 with 18:09 remaining.
Washington College went ahead
briefly before captain John
Podgajny hit a jump shot with
10:37 left that put W&L in the
lead for good. Flint, Leunig, Mike
Wenke and Don Berlin came off
the bench to rally the Generals
on to an 86-67 win.

Matmen victorious so far

“This looks like the best team
we've had in recent years,” said
Washington and Lee coach Gary
Franke. “Barring any injuries we
could go a long way.”

Coach Franke’s pre-season pre-
diction has been accurate so far
as W&L’s wrestling team is off to
one of its best starts in history
with three victories by big marg-
ins in its first three starts.

The Generals opened their sea-
son December 2 in Lexington beat-
ing Lynchburg College and Vir-
ginia State, 41-3 and 346. W&L
continued its winning ways the
next day in Harrisonburg against
Bridgewater College, 49-2.

Twenty-one members are on this
year’s squad which includes six
freshmen. Four of  Franke’s

wrestlers boast 3-0 records. These
include junior captain Jim Crytzer
(158 lbs.), senior Lee Keck (126-
134), junior Bill Cole (177) and
freshman Dan Kniffen (heavy-
weight).

Senior Rick Heldrich (167) and
freshmen Andy King (142-150)
and Kevin McFadden (167) have
won two matches.

The Generals are without the
services of junior letterman,
Steve Schweizerhof, who will be
unable to compete until some-
time in January due to an ear
injury he received playing foot-
ball.

So far the Generals have man-
aged without him, however, and
have a shot at the VCAA champ-

 

Junior captain Jim Crytzer was last year’s most valuable wrestler

compiling a 14-6-2 record.

Swimmers

continue

their winning ways

Washington and Lee's swimming
team continued its winning ways
November 20 and December 3 by
defeating the Dukes of Madison
66-47 and V.M.I, 71-44

The Generals are undefeated in
the young season and five team
members have been listed among
the nation’s top ten in NCAA
competition. Sophomore freestyler
John Hudson is listed first among
the nation’s swimmers in two
events, the 500-yard and 1000
yard freestyle, in the latest NCAA
Division I listings. Junior Tad
Van Leer likewise is first in the
fO-vard freestyle, while freshman
Chip Hoke ranks second in the
200-yard backstroke

Joining Hudson and Van Leer
m the 400-yard freestyle relay
eam which ranks fourth nation
wide are senior Gary Seldomridge
ind freshman Keith Romich

In the meet against Madison
W&L set nine Madison school rec
wds and placed first in all but

wo events

Sophomore John Hudson placed

inst in two events for the Gen
rails, the 500- and 1000-yard free
ivie. boasting times of 4:55.90 and

0:15.86. Freshman Keith Romich

placed second in the 500 while
senior Bill Tiers got third in the
1000 to further help the Gen
erals

Captain Red Scott also won two
events for W&L in the 200 indi
viduals medley, 2:09.1, and the
butterfly, 2:12.5. Freshman Chip
Hoke placed a close second behind
Seott in the 200 individual med
ley with a time of 2:10.3. Hoke
did even better, however, in the
200-yard backstroke, By swim
ming the time of 2:06.5, Hoke
broke All-American Billy Ball's
old schoo' record

Junior Tad Van Leer placed
first in the 50- and 100-yard free
style events. Keith Romich and
William Gregg placed first and
second in the 200-yvard freestyle
Gary Seldomridge won the 200
yard breast in 2:30

Billy Cogar led the Generals
in diving with first place finishes
in both the one and three meter
dives. W&L's relay teams finished
second and third in the 400-yard
medley and 400-yard freestyle re
lays

The Generals easily beat V.M.1
and will swim Saturday againat
Virginia Tech in Blacksburg

ionship. Last year W&L finished
second in VCAA competition with
a 9-8 record. The Generals will
compete in 19 matches this year
including four home appearances.

Coach Franke’s men travel to
Durham, N.C. January 10 to face
a strong Duke University team.
The next home meet is against
Hampden-Sydney January 14 at
7:30 p.m.

Lynchburg College gave the
Generals their first loss December
1, 85-84. W&L was behind the en-
tire game and trailed by as much
as 17 points at one point in the
second half. The Generals fought
back and actually took the lead
with 16 seconds remaining but
lost it as a Lynchburg player
made a layup with four seconds
left. W&L failed to score and lost
by the narrow one-point margin.
Podgajny and Larson were the
leading scorers for W&L with 26
and 20 points.

December 3 brought the Uni-
versity of Virginia Wahoos to
town in a game which saw the
Generals trampled by a much
taller team. W&L’s first half field
goal percentage was a meager 27
per cent compared to 58.6 for
UVA. The Generals never led as
a good Wahoo team won 101-57.
The only consolation for the Gen-
erals that night was an earlier
45-44 victory against the UVA
junior varsity team by a good
shooting W&L JV team.

W&L split a pair of games over
the holidays losing to Eckerd Col-
lege 87-76 and beating St. Leo’s
College 60-54. In the St. Leo’s
game, W&L led all the way for
a win that broke a three game
losing streak and brought their
season record to 3-3. Kristoff led
the Generals with 12 points, while
Podgajny and Berlin had 10 points
apiece.

The Generals travelled to
Bridgewater College yesterday
and will host the W&L Invita-
tional January 9-10 against Lycom-
ing, Lock Haven State and Salsi-
bury State.

THE RING-TUM PHI 3

Center Norm Kristoff jumps high for the ball in the season opener
against York College as John Podgajny, Bob Forlenza and Chris

Larson await the tip.

Slatcoff predicts football turnaround soon

“Within the next two years ‘the
football program is going to be
turned around, and Washington
and Lee University is going to
have a winner.”

The speaker was not the college
president soliciting funds from
the alumni, nor a football coach
trying to bolster the team’s spirits
after a 1-8-1 season. The speaker
was sophomore linebacker Jeff
Slatcoff, who is as enthusiastic
about Washington and Lee—both
the school and its football pro-
gram—today as he was when he
left Windber, Pa. two years ago
to enroll here.

‘A small school like W&L has
a lot more to offer than many big
schools,” said Slatcoff, who was
approached by several of the
larger Pennsylvania schools about
a football career there. “At W&L,
you are simply playing for your
own benefit and not being paid
for it. And in my opinion you
can't get any better education.”

Slatcoff really does talk that
way. And he “speaks” the same
language on the football field,
where he is the Generals’ lead-
ing tackler by far. In W&L’s 10
games this year, Slateoff had 189
tackles and assisted on 33 others.

,

eo

 

That's a total of 222, or over 22
a game. Plus two passes broken
up, two fumbles recovered, one
fumble caused and a blocked kick.

And those are not padded by
some publicity-happy statistician;
they’re taken from the game films
by the defensive coaches, who
don’t give any credit for merely
jumping onto a pile.

“Jeff's probably leading the
whole country in tackles,” opin-
ioned W&L defensive coordinator
Boyd Williams.

Some of Slatcoff's performances
border on the incredible, such as
the Sewanee game, when he made
8 tackles and assisted on four
more, broke up a pass and block-
ed an extra point attempt. He had
24 tackles in November against
Georgetown, 21 vs. Madison, 19
on another occasion and 18 in
three other games. And so on.
The second leading tackler for
W&L had 89 for the whole year.

There’s a great mutual ; 1
miration thing going between
Slateoff and defensive coordina-
tor Williams, who recruited him
from Windber Area High School.
Williams, a native of the same
Pennsylvania area who played for
Syracuse and the Philadelphia

Sophomore linebacker Jeff Slatcoff compiled 189 tackies and 33
assists this year to lead the General defense.

Eagles, says “I wish we had more
like Jeff. He’s a hell of a com-
petitor, he busts his tail on every
play, and he doesn’t know what
the word ‘loafing’ means.”

Williams feels Slatcoff
play football anywhere in the
country, although his relative
small size (6-0, 214) might be a
handicap at a big football school.
He’s a winner, William notes. “He
came out of a winning program
in a tough area around Pittsburgh,
he hates to lose, and he’s not used
to anything but winning. | think

could

we can count on him to con-
tribute more than his share to-
ward turning this program
around.”

Slatcoff won't go far out on
any limbs in predicting the turn-
around. He simply says, “We may
not have a winning season in my

two remaining years, but before
I leave it’s going to be turned
around in that direction, The kids
that come afterwards are going
to be winners.”

Linebacker coach Chuck O’Con-
nell attributes Slatcoff’s success to
his “nose for the football” and
his upper body strength. “Lots
of times he gets to the runner
on the other side of the line
before the linebacker on that side
does,” O’Connel notes. “And he
uses his forearms very well to
ward off blockers.”

Perhaps the ultimate compli-
ment comes from Mrs. Minnie K.
Ellis, the seamstress who repairs
the Generals’ jersies after every
game. “What's that no. 66?” Mrs.
Ellis said after one recent game.
“That's the most torn jersey I've
had yet.”

In Italy in the 1800's a chance meeting between a poor
priest and a street urchin served to create a movement of such
success that it is still growing today. Don Bosco became the
priest who brought youth back from the streets — and

back to God.

He reasoned that a program of play, learn and pray would
make useful citizens of the world. He crowded out evil with
reason, religion and kindness in a (what was then unheard of)

atmosphere of family.

The ideais of St. John Bosco are still with us today. His
work goes on in boys clubs, technical and academic schools
guidance centers, summer camps and missions, And his very
human approach is very evident in the family spirit of the
Salesians. This is the way he wanted it. This is the way it is.
The Salesian experience isn't learned — it's lived.
