The inimitable “Daddy Rabbit,” shown above
playing at the Pavilion during Saturday after-
noon’s junior class grain party, was one of the
main attractions of Springs weekend. ‘Daddy
Rabbit” was sponsored by the junior class for
the grain party and estimates of the number of
persons attending run into outrageous figures.
There is general agreement on the statement that

a lot of drunks attended.

(The members of the band are, from left to

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, APRIL 29,

E.C. tables salary dispute;
Phi, Calyx money at issue

About 250 people journeyed to Zollman’s on
Thursday to hear “Passage,” billed as a “Top-40”
band, and about the same number shook off their
hangovers to trot down to the meadow and listen
to the “Plank Road String Band” on Sunday.

In other festivities, “Daddy Rabbit’ moved on
to the Delt house Saturday night to play for a
party sponsored by the Delts, Pika, and Phi Psi.

And lest we forget, at least 2100 people attend-

ed the Spinners concert. At $5 a head, that trans-
lates to roughly $10,500.

nomic and cultural contacts,

19) Recognizing that a potential
crisis still exists in the Middle
East, the United States will con
tinue to strongly support the
existence of Israel and will de
nounce terrorism and all groups
perpetrating such acts.

20) The United States will con
tinue to support its commitment
to collective defense, as embodied
in NATO, and will encourage the
member nations to accept an
equitable share of the responsi
bilities and cost for this defense

As the United States embarks
upon her third century a8 a na
tion, a serious reevaluation of
her goals should be undertaken
Present policies must be viewed
with an open mind that considers
the future direction of the de
velopment of American society
The national spirit that establish
ed America as a great nation and
allowed it to remain so, should
be reasserted by a reawakenin
of contidence in the federal gov

ernment.

While the average U.S. citizen
enjoys one of the highest stand-
ards of living in the world, large
sections of the populace do not
share in this abundance. It js
the duty of the American gov-
ernment to provide each citizen
with the opportunity to attain an
acceptable standard of living.

1976

By MIKE GALLAGHER

The main topic of discussion at
Monday night’s E.C. meeting was
whether or not the editors and
business mangers of the Ring-
tum Phi and the Calyx should re-
ceive a salary for their duties.

A salary of $500 is split be-
tween the business manager and
editor of each organization.
Mynders Glover raised the issue,
saying he couldn’t understand
why the head of only those two
committees were paid and the
chairmen of the other committees
worked voluntarily.

The discussion around the
omiscient semicircle ranged from
Bobby Pugh’s explanation that
the heads of the RtP and Calyx
have more responsibility than the
heads of other committees since
they have to meet publication
deadlines and so on; to Leland
McCullough’s justification that
“everybody else does it,” in refer-
ence to other colleges paying their
editors.

When the discussion was open-
ed to the floor, Steve Yevich,
present editor of the Ring-tum
Phi, revealed a new salary plan
for next year. The editor and
business manager would receive
a salary of $100 each and also
receive a percentage of the profits
at the end of the fiscal year.

News editor Joe Fitzgerald
spoke out in favor of the salaries,
saying the Phi and Calyx had
“staffs” and not committees and
were run like businesses, thence
justification for the salaries.

It was also brought out that
the small salaries might be in-
centives for anyone wishing to
apply for those jobs. It was finally
decided to table discussion oa
the issue until next Monday, after
the members have had a chance

463-4303), New York (Craig
Owens; 463-9586), Ohio (Jim Falk;
463-9545) and Pennsylvania (Gary
Fitzerald; 463-9579).

Students interested in working
for these delegations should con-
tact the person indicated as soon
as possible.

Positions are also open for stu-
dents who would like to work on
the security squad during the
convention. The person to contact
is Angelo Santella at 463-2692.

Flesher, present Contact co-chair-
man. Students with questions
about how to fill out the applica-
tions should contact Flesher.
Flesher also reported to the
EC that IFC has only paid $1300
from a $3000 pledge it made to
the Contact committee at the
beginning of the year. He re-
quested EC help in collecting

this debt.
Flesher ended his report by
saying that attorney William

Kuntsler will probably not come

as a Contact speaker this year
because of previous commitments
he has, but arrangements are be-
ing made to bring other speakers
to fill out the year’s program.

Bob Rogers, representing the
newly organized Guitar Club, ap-
proached the EC for funds to buy
songbooks for the members. When
questioned, he revealed that the
members had not been assessed
dues as yet, but wanted to see
what the EC could do for them.
Since Rogers had no clear esti-
mate as to the amount of money
the club needed, Scott Franklin
suggested they assess their mem-
bers $1.50 in dues and buy their
own songbooks. If this turned out
not to be the answer to their
problems, Rogers was told to
approach the budget committee
next fall.

Adm. Elmo Zumwalt visited the campus last Friday to speak with
Mock Convention people about some of the issues facing the
Democratic party in the President campaign. Zumwalt is the only
announced candidate for the Democratic nomination to challenge
U. S. Sen. Harry F. Byrd, Jr. (Ind.) in this year’s election. Another
speaker announced this week is Don Fowler, chairman of the
South Carolina Democratic Party. Fowler, who spoke to state
chairmen on campus last month, will deliver the opening address

to the assembled delegates next Friday.

Applications for admission to

W&L’s law school next Septem-
ber rose by 12 per cent this year
over the number a year ago,
according to statistics released
last week.

In all, 1,177 applications were
received this year, compared with
last year’s total of 1,044 accord-
ing to Roy L. Steinheimer Jr.,
dean of the law school. The 1976
figures translate into almost 11
applications for each of the 110
places in September’s entering
class.

The first-year law class next
fall will be almost half again as
large as previous first-year law
classes, which have averaged 80
students. The increase, which has
been in the planning for several
years, will be possible because
the law school moves into its new
$7-million home, Lewis Hall, over
the summer.

Steinheimer reported the en-
tering class in September will in-
clude students from 30 states who
have attended about 60 different
undergraduate colleges.

He said the overall quality of
the 1976 applicants, judged by
Law School Admission Test scores
and undergraduate grade-point
averages, “is the best we’ve ever

had.” He said Washington and
Tee’s undergraduate schools led
the list of colleges attended by
those who will enroll next fall
in the law program.

10 earlier expected, and down
even farther from an outrageous

Floats for the parade will in-

Steinheimer said the number of
vomen who applied and the num-
ber accepted were ‘about the
same” as last year, when about
one-sixth of the first-year students
were women. (The law school has
been coeducational since 1972),

Currently, the Tucker Hall has
a student population of 240, with
about 80 students in each class.
With the new law building, how-
ever, total enrollment will in-
crease to between 330 and 350.
The increase will be gradual,
with about 110 students accepted
each year until the law school
is brought up to full strength in
1978.

As the student body increases
in size the faculty will be increas-
ed proportionately as well, main-
taining W&L’s traditional 1:17
teacher-student ratio in the law
school. (The national mean, ac-
cording to the Association of
American Law Students, is be-
tween 1:23 and 1:24.)

The gradual 100-student  in-
crease in the law school will allow
W&L to expand the faculty in line
with the increasing specialization
demanded in contemporary legal
education, University officials say,
without sacrificing the  smalil-
school, personal environment
which characterizes the school.

Even with a student population
of 330 or 350, Washington and
Lee’s will remain one of the
smallest law schools in the na-
tion. In its planning at both the
undergraduate and law levels,
W&L has deliberately sought to
keep its size relatively small and
its admissions selective.

Steinheimer said Lewis Hall ahs
been “an important factor” in the
increase in number of applica-
tions this year. The new facility
will give W&L one of the best-
equipped, most technologically ad-
vanced law schools in the coun-
try, he said.

In addition to classrooms, fac-
ulty and administrative offices,
and extensive areas for student
and professional activities, Lewis
Hall will house a 250,000-volume
law library and a full-size court-
room which ultimately will be
equipped with complete television
facilities to enable students to
practice their courtroom techni-
ques and then view their own
performances on videotape to see
where improvement is necessary.

Thoughout the building, elec-
tronic connections to a media-
control center will eventually
permit instantaneous information-
retrieval.

Lewis Hall has more than six
times the area Tucker Hall, which
will be used to help meet under-
graduate classroom and faculty-
office pressures when the law
school moves.

Tucker Hall had long been in-
adequate to house the law school.
A gift of $9 million to Washington
and Lee in 1972 from Sydney and
Frances Lewis enabled construc-
tion to begin on the new law
facility. The Lewises designated
$7 million of their gift to support
construction, and $2 million to
endow a law-research center.

Counting the Lewis gift, W&L
has raised almost $12.1 million
for law school purposes so far in
its development program for the
decade of the 1970s.

Generals trounce Towson

By BILL FLESHER

Washington and Lee’s drive for
the post-season tournament began
one quarter later than expected
Saturday, but did begin in time
to keep that drive alive.

The Generals, stymied by an

inspired Towson State defense
throughout the opening period,

exploded for eight second-quarter
goals en route to a 13-9 win over
the Tigers before 3500 at Wilson
Field.

W&L, now 6-3, wiped out a 3-0
first quarter deficit by scoring
on their first four sh ts of the
second period, then took the lead
for good on three tallies within
87 seconds late in the first half.

Once in command, the Generals’
defense held the ‘Tigers’ high-
powered midfielders in cheek,
which was the key to the game,
according to both coaches.

“We defensed their isolation
moves quite well,” said W&lL
coach Jack Emmer, noting that
only three of Towson State’s goals
were scored by midfielders.

middies

“WE&L's played good
basie lacrosse,’ a disappointed
Towson State mentor Carl Runk
said. “That’s what beat us—our
middies broke down, and W&L
was able to control the game.”

Another reason the Generais
were able to dominate for much
of the afternoon was the play of
freshman faceoff specialist Jim
Babcock.

The 5’11”, 195-pound first-year
man controlled 16 of 27 faceoffs,
including seven in a row during
the Generals’ second-quarter
surge. Babcock also came up with
the day’s best shot when he
leveled Towson’s Pat Maher with
a flying check near the sidelines.

The play resulted in some heat-
ed arguing by the Towson coach-
ing staff. All it earned them was

mentor Jack Emmer will coach
the South team in this year’s
North-South All-Star lacrosse
game, the Ring-tum Phi has learn-
ed.

The post-season match, which
features the nation’s top seniors,
will be played at Charlottesville’s
Scott Stadium June 5.

This will be Emmer’s first ap-
pearance as head coach in the
North-South game. While at Cort-
land State in 1972, he served as
an assistant cocch for the North
squad.

Player selection for the game
will be made sometime after the
regular season,

The weekly mystery known as
the USILA coaches’ poll again
baffled a number of people upon
its release Monday.

In case you missed it, W&L was
ranked tenth for the second
straight week, while Maryland
moved into a first-place tie with
Cornell.

There are several mind-bogglers
in this week's rankings. For ex-
ample. W&L convincingly beat
Towson State, ranked fourth in
the College Division, but did not
move ahead of number nine
Brown, a 20-10 loser to sixth
ranked Johns Hopkins.

a one minute bench penalty,
which the Generals converted into
a Jack Dudley goal that put W&L
on its way.

“We were really pleased with
the way our younger kids played.”
Emmer said, referring to Babcock
and freshmen attackmen Chris
Kearney, Jeff Fritz, and John
Black, all of whom saw extensive
action against Towson State.

Kearney led W&L with three
goals, all coming during the sec-
ond period, while Fritz, who was
starting earlier in the year, added
two goals and an assist.

“We knew Jeff could get the
job done. It was just a matter of
time before he settled down and
started playing like he can,”
Emmer said. The W&L coach al-
so praised the Generals’ blanced
scoring from the midfields. Al!
six members of the top two mid-
fielders had at least one goal,
with Charlie Stieff coming up with
a pair.

One of those middies was Don-
ny Carroll, who made the switch
from attack earlier in the week.

“It’s tough for a senior who has
been on attack for three-and-a-
half years to move to the mid-
field,’ Emmer said of the senior
tri-captain. “But Donny did what
we asked, and played a heck of
a game Saturday.”

Just about everyone wearing a
blue jersey played well, although
it took a bit more than a quarter
for W&L to get on the scoreboard.

Crease attackman Tom Nelson
scored Towson State’s first two
goals, the first in an extra-man
situation at 4:19, the second about
six minutes later when he stuffed
an attempted clearing pass by

Washington and Lee’s baseball
team won three of five games last
week in a grueling five-day sched-
ule. The Generals defeated VMI
and swept a doubleheader from
Bridgewater, and lost to Madison
and Hampden-Sydney. The Gen-
erals lost to Lynchburg on Mon-
day, 7-0.

Last Tuesday, the Generals beat
visiting VMI 12-7. The Keydets
had beaten W&L, 11-0, earlier in
the year. Senior captain Dave
Otey hit a two-out, bases-loaded
triple in the first inning to key
the scoring. Pitcher Dan West-
brook did not allow a run until
the seventh inning.

Hlampden-Sydney beat the Gen-
erals 8-3 on Wednessday. Fresh-
man Rich Wiles scored one run
and knocked in another one.

Bruce Williams allowed only
one run through five innings to
a powerful Madison club, before
he lost his control in the sixth
in a 40 loss. Mike Falcone had
two hits for W&L.

Washington and Lee swept its
second doubleheader this year on
Saturday when it beat Bridge-
water 9-0 and 7-6 at home. Dan

W&L goalie Charlie Brown and
dropped the ball into the open net.
The Tigers increased their lead
to 3-0 when attackman Paul Mul-
len backed in on All-American de-
fenseman Rob Lindsey, then drib-
bled a low bouncer past Brown
from about four yeards out.

Throughout the first period
W&L got several good shots on
goal, only to see Towson State
goalie Jeff Jones turn each of
them away. Jones came up with
cight of his 17 saves during the
first quarter, two of them to stop
point blank shots by Chris Law-
son and Jack Dudley.

But the Generals’ shots began
to find the cage soon enough. Rob
Morgan took a feed from Carroll
on the crease and beat Jones with
a high shot at 2:15 of the second
peiiod to put W&L on the board.

Forty-seven seconds later Fritz
moved W&L to within a goal
with a hard bounce shot from

WéeL netters win VCAA tennis crown

Host Washington and Lee won
six of nine matches to win the
fourth annual VCAA _ tennis
championship here Saturday.

The Generals won the title with
66 points to 34 for runner-up
Emory & Henry. Third went to
Hampden-Sydney, followed by
George Mason, Madison, and
Bridgewater.

W&L’s Ben Johns, who won the
no. 1 singles championship, was
voted the VCAA’s Player-of-the-
Year and W&L coach Dennis Bus-

Westbrook shut out the Eagles
on two hits in the first game and
Dave Otey had two RBI's. Otey
also knocked in the tying runs in
the bottom of the sixth inning
of the second game with a two-run
homer. Bill Gregg was the win-
ning pitcher.

sard was named Coach-of-the-Year.
Other individual champions for
W&L were Ken Voelker at no. 4
and Rob Smith at no. 6. The Gen-
erals swept the doubles competi-
tion, with Johns and Voelker win-
ning at no. 1, Ben Caffery and
Smith at no. 2, and Jim Fisher
and Robert Wilson at no. 3.

The Generals saw their season
record drop to 9-7 when they
dropped two of their three match-
es during the past week.

ing the VCAA tournament, which
begins Saturday in Lynchburg.

That enigma, the USILA coaches’ poll, again spurns the Generals

(Continued trom page 3)

Meanwhile Virginia held on to
sixth place even they had to go
to overtime to beat Towson State
(a game which has been pro-
tested by the Tigers), 16-15, while
William and Mary, not one of the
lacrosse biggies, stayed with the
Cavaliers before falling, 15-7.

Then there’s the strange case
of Hofstra. After a slow start, the
Flying Dutchmen have beaten
W&L and Adelphi (number two
in the College Division) in their

last two outings. Yet they are
ranked eighth, right behind

Hofstra early in the season.

Possibly the most perplexing
development in this week’s poll
is the tie for the top spot. First-
place deadlocks have happened
before, but rarely when an odd
number of coaches vote in the
poll. Cornell received five first-
place votes this week, while Mary-
land was named on four ballots.
The tie occurred when one coach
who picked the Terps as the top
team went with Navy over Corne}l
for second.

It’s interesting to note that
Maryland coach Buddy Beardmore
is one of ten coaches who votes
in the University Division poll,
while Cornell’s Richie Moran must
keep his preferences to himself.

Keep in mind throughout ali
this confusion that the poll has
little impact on which eight
teams receive bids to the NCAA
tournament.

The NCAA selection committee
relies more on season records and
performances against key  op-
ponents in making its picks—at
least they have in the past.

Freshman attac ane Jeff Fritz,
who played his best game of the
year Saturday, was given the Can-
non Award for his two goals, one

assist effort against Towson State
The nine-game statistics show
the Generals’ scoring to be more
balanced this year than during
the past five seasons. Donny
Carroll leads the team with 31
total points, while three other
players—Rob Morgan, Chris Kear-
ney, and Jack Dudley—are over
the 20-point mark. Another five
players are in double figures...
Kearney has a team-high 18 goals,
while Carroll leads with 19 assists
. Tom Keigler is far and away
the ground ball leader with 109.
Mark your calendars and sched-
ules. The W&L-Virginia game has
been moved up to noon on May
15. The time change was nec-
cessitated because of commence-
ment exercises that weekend in
Charlottesville . . . Maybe it was
the unique practice methods that
had something to do with W&L’s
performance Saturday. The Gen-
erals opened the week with a
lacrosse softball game on Mon-
day—hit the ball with a bat, but
play the field with lacrosse sticks.
Then the team held a_ sunrise
practice—how does lacrosse af
6:45 in the morning sound? — on
Wednesday so that the players
and coaches could take in the Vir-
ginia-Towson State game that

test of that game stands a good
chance of being upheld by the

USILA, according to many _ ob-
serves. Apparently the Cavaliers

asked for a stick check at the
wrong time, It resulted in a three-
minute penalty against the Tigers,
who lost a two-goal lead during
the overtime and ended up drop-

Led by its two
teams, Washington

of 11 teams in last weekend's
Virginia Collegiate Athletic As-
sociation (VCAA) track and field
championships.

W&L’s 440-yard relay finished
second behind Virginia State with
a time of :43.7. The Generals’ mile
relay took a fourth place finish.

Only two individual performers
placed for W&L. Senior Jack
Berry was fourth in the javelin,
while junior Paul Thompson ran
third in the 880-yar drun.

Virginia State ran away with
the team championship, scoring
117 points.

eight yards out. Then Kearney
picked up a pair of extra-man
goals, the first on a low screamer
at 4:23, the second on a high
sidearm shot that hit the top
corner at 6:21 of the period.

The Tigers came back to tie
the game at 4-4 on Mitch Lekas’
extra-‘man goal at 8:11. But Kear-
ney and Fritz worked a_ perfect
attack play behind the goal at
10:11, Kearney scoring his third
goal to put the Generals ahead to
stay.

W&L increased their lead to 7
4 as Stieff worked an isolation
move to set up a hard bounce shot
that beat Jones, followed by Dud-
ley’s extra-man score that was
made possible by the bench pen-
alty against Towson State.

The two teams traded goals un-
til midway through the third
period, when W&L middies Stieff,

Towson State came back to

quarter on goals by Nelson and
Andrew Paris, but six final period
saves by Brown, who finished the
day with 22 stops, and a goal by
Fritz with 3:06 left put the game
out of Towson State’s reach.

The win set up a very im-
