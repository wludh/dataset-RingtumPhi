Arkansas senator to deliver
unity address at convention

By The News Staff

Arkansas Senator Dale Bumpers
will speak to the Mock Conven-
tion on Saturday, May 8, to
deliver the Democratic Party
Unity Speech. Bumpers’ address
will begin before the nominating
process,

Bumpers’ appearance was an-
nounced Friday by WLUR-FM
and confirmed Monday by the MC
Media committee.

The purpose of the address, ac-
cording to MC political chairman
Reed Morgan, is to define the
qualities expected of the Demo-

crats’ Presidential nominee and
to emphasize W&L’s responsibility
to uphold its convention’s record.

Bumpers was selected by the
convention to give some regional
diversity to the slate of speakers
scheduled to appear during the
two-day convention. Bumpers
joins keynote speaker William
Proxmire, a senator from the Mid-
west, and platform speaker Don
Riegle, a representative, also from
the Midwest.

Bumpers was selected to repre-
sent the Southern wing of the
party at the Mock Convention be-

EC splits on vote
to fund “The Boys’

By BOB CHIAVIELLO

The Executive Committee voted
7-4 Monday night to appropriate
$50 for director Brian Garr’s pro-
duction of The Boys in the Band
in March. The vote followed much
heated discussion.

The EC had made an informal
poll of the student body to see
how it would react to a play with
homosexual overtones. A major
objection to the play was the
possibly offensive nature of the
script. Bill Garrison said, “I can’t
sanction the activity because it
won't be a family type entertain-
ment for the townspeople.”

When a student remarked if
the EC appropriated $50 a week
to such activities it would cost
the student body $1500, Leland
McCullough said, “I don’t know
nothin "bout math,” but quickly
added that it wasn’t the money
but the moral issue involved.

Radar Davis cited that in ‘The
Devil in Miss Jones” there were
homosexual acts and no one
minded,

At the end of the discussion
Brian Garr thanked the EC for
a job well done in polling the
University community about the
play

The curriculum committee re
ported that it is on schedule with
its course survey. They have a
“computer expert” working on
the project trying to iron out a
few of the remaining problems.

Rick Wolf reported that all the
speakers have been signed for the
Mock Convention, but that nothing

is real rosy. They have met with
Coach Miller and all is well:
Doremus Gym will be available
for the convention!

Jay McCann, the editor of
Ariel, reported that a nice big
winter issue is at the printer now.
There will be 300 copies of the

cause of his reputation as a “suc-
cessful Southern Governor and
popular Democrat,” according to
the Media committee.

Bumpers, the junior senator
from Arkansas, received national
prominence in 1974 by unseating
incumbent J. William Fulbright

in the Senate primary, taking
65° of the vote.

Bumpers was governor of
Arkansas from 1970-74, leaving

the post partly because of the low
pay. Arkansas pays its executive
$10,000 a year, the lowest gub-
ernatorial remuneration in the
nation.

Part of Bumpers’ campaign for
governor in 1970 ineluded his
declaration that segregation is
“immoral.” As governor of Ark-
ansas, he served as chairman of
the National Democratic Gover-
nors’ Caucus.

The 50-year old senator cur-
rently serves on the Aeronautical
and Space Sciences Committee,
and on two subcommittees of the
Interior and Insular Affairs Com-
mittee. The subcommittees are
the Energy Research and Water
Resources, and the Environmental
and Land Resources.

Caucus victories benefit Carter

By DORMAN WALKER

Jimmy Carter may be Washing-
ton and Lee’s Democratic nomi-
nee if the Mock Convention tradi-
tion of grass-roots accuracy is in
evidence this Spring. With caucus
victories in lowa and Maine, and
near-victories in Oklahoma and
Mississippi, Carter will roll into
the Convention with a lot of
delegates and a lot of support.

His caucus victories result in
part from his well-organized cam-
paign staff, and this same staff
is expected to help Carter win
in New Hampshire.

The New Hampshire primary
will be a three-way battle be-
tween Carter, Udall, and Birch
Bayh, according to Chris Brown,

Carter was born in Georgia and

from the Naval Academy in
Annapolis he did research in nu-

the Navy and started a peanut
farm in Georgia. Seventeen years
later he was elected governor of
that state.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Thursday, February 12, 1976

Potpourri

The Executive Committee voted to fund the upcoming
production of the play, “The Boys in the Band.” Members of
that august body did go out among their fellow classmates and
did poll them on the issue—although the responses were fairly
divided, it appears that slightly more students supported the
use of student body funds for the presentation than were
opposed to the idea.

In the end, the individual members of the E.C. voted not
on the basis of their personal prejudices. They voted the way
they felt their constituents would want them to—which is
how they are supposed to vote.

Ss es eS

In the drama debate, it was mentioned a number of times
that the play should not be sanctioned by the E.C. (or even
be produced, for that matter) because it might prove offensive
to members of the Lexington community-at-large. We do not
agree with that objection, and we do not feel that our dramatic
productions should cater to the preferences of the com-
munity—there are other means to develop beneficial relations
between “town” and “gown” than to hamstring ourselves
artistically.

A further item on Monday night's agenda illustrated this
that the Mock
Convention Secretariat has been in contact with members of
the senior class at Lexington High School, and has thus far
received encouraging replies concerning involvement of high

point well, we thought. It was disclosed

school students in the upcoming mock Democratic Conven-
tion. Townspeople enjoy observing the quadrennial parade
and other festivities, but the inclusion of Lexington students
in the actual operations of the convention is an idea worthy
of full consideration and support (and would aid in com-
munity relations, no doubt).

\ preliminary survey has been taken among the members
of the junior and senior classes regarding the re-establish-
ment of a mandatory Freshman English Composition course.
Of the ninety or so students polled, roughly 75% were in
favor of reinstating such a requirement. After all the brouhaha
in the Sixties before specific course requirements were abolish-
ed, we find it curious to note the trend exhibited in recent
polls on the subject, both here and at other colleges. It seems
that a student who is graduated under the “liberalized” system
frequently finds that he cannot compose a coherent, gram-
matically accurate sentence, find the hypotenuse of a right
triangle, or even name the beligerents in the Thirty Years’
War. Perhaps basic requirments, at least in English, would
put us back on the road leading toward liberal education, in
the true sense of the phrase.

The student whose auto was damaged several weeks ago
by a band of disorderly students discovered last Wednesday
that the roof of his car had been slashed. We did not condone
the original damage, although we may have implied it in-
advertently. We find this newest episode deplorable, and are
disgusted by the fact that there is a student on this campus
who would even consider such action, It is indeed a depraved
person that would continue to harass the owner of the car,
and it is our hope that, if and when it catches the criminal(s)
involved in this latest incident, Student Control will not be
lenient in its determination of the proper punishment.

* * * * *

Speakng of students and criminal acts, we understand that
in recent weeks there have been a number of individuals who
have either been going through the meal line in Evans Dining
Hall twice or have been lending their meal cards to un-
authorized individuals. Students are reminded that either of
these practices is considered an Honor Violation,

We would also like to remind all freshmen who belong to
fraternities that they are required to eat at their respective
houses on the indicated nights. The practice of eating at a
fraternity house and then again at dining hall is questionable,
and offenders will be dealt with severely when apprehended

‘The Visit’: the good, the bad,
and the possibly confusing

By W. S. BAKER

At a school where only four or
five plays are presented each year
one must criticize carefully. After
all, they might stop putting them
on altogether. And yet in the case
of “The Visit” I can’t help but
think this might be best.

Friedrich Durrenmatt’s  tragi-
comic vision of the victory of
greed in a world without God is
currently being produced by the
University Theatre, under the di-
rection of Robert Mish. There will
be one last performance, tonight
at 8:00 p.m., and all who have yet
to see the show are highly recom-
mended to do so. Despite minor
technical problems and some con-
fusing thematic inconsistencies,
the morality tale is still worth
the two hours the play lasts.

The play centers on the town
of Guellen, its citizens, and a
group of visitors, the most promi-
nent of which is Mme. Clare
Zachanassian (played by Jennifer
Taylor.) The town is being strangl-
ed by poverty, a financial desti-
tution that mysteriously beset the
once-prosperous community some
years before. Later in the play we
learn more of Guellen’s history;
specifically of the trial of a 17
year old girl, the court’s decision
of guilt, her pregnancy and her
ignoble depature from town. This
girl (Clare) then became a whore,
met and married an oil ty-

The 1972 Mock Convention was
big. The Ring-tum Phi of that day
and year frequently mentioned
this fact. As evidence of the MC's
size, the newspaper often noted
that the budget for the affair was
a massive $12,000. The funds for
this year’s extravaganza approach
$32,000, as noted in the title of
this column. The total student
body budget for this school year
is about $56,000.

The student body funds are con-
trolled by the Executive Commit-
tee, which meets once a week to
review how the various commit-
tees are spending the money
given them in September. In its
Monday night meetings, the E.C.
will also give out more student
body money on occasion, to fund
such projects as jazz trumpeteers,
ethnic poets, and an issue or two
of an alternative rag.

The MC funds are controlled by
a steering committee, which meets
once a week to review the various
projects essential to the success
of the MC. In its Sunday night
meetings the steering committee
looks at the progress of the sev-
eral committees and delegations
that will converge on Doremus
Gym in three months to decide in
two days what the Democratic
Party will decide in a week.

The meetings of the E.C. are
open to the press with one stipula-
tion: the committee regularly goes
into executive session to discuss
appointments to student body sub-
committees, even though the stu-
dent body constitution states that
the E.C. may close its meetings
only to discuss “matters of honor.”

The meetings of the steering
committee of the MC are open
to the press with one stipulation
they are “open, but off the ree-
ord,” according to political chair:
man Reed Morgan. The student
body constitution makes no com-

One final note. A member of the Executive Committee

The Executive Committee in

Students who suspect that
another student is being charged
with a possible honor violation,
or hear rumors to that effect, have
an obligation to that student not
only to keep silent, but also to
encourage others to do so. The
reason for this silence becomes
quite clear when one imagines
himself as the accused student

coon and became Clare Zachnas-
sian, “the richest woman in the
world.”

Eight husbands later Clare has
returned to Guellen to purchase
the justice denied on that fateful
day long ago. It was on that day
that Anton Schill (played by Brock
Johnson) denied Clare in court
(even as she carried his child.)
Clare offers to restore Guellen’s
prosperity by donating a billion

The SCC and student

By PAUL MORELLA
and STEPHEN YEVICH

Originally created by the Uni-
versity faculty, the Student Con-
trol Committee (SCC) was de-
signed to investigate, act upon
and exercise the faculty's inherent
power to control student conduct.

With all the rumors that have
been circulating in recent weeks
about the SCC, and the notice
which appeared on __ bulletin
boards concerning SCC action on
a marijuana case, the Ring-tum
Phi thought it would be appropri-
ate to present some basic in-

ment on when these meetings may
be closed.

Tradition would seem to indi-
cate that this body, commanding
a third of the student body
budget, should hold its meetings
in private. After all, when the
Democrats meet in New York this
summer, chances are the hysteria
on the floor will be little more
than a warm-up for the headline
performance in the notorious
smoke-filled back room.

The MC office is not exactly a
moke-filled room, but it will have
to serve the purpose this time,
even if it does look like the room
where the next president of the
Jaycees would be picked, not
the President of the United States.
The walls are lined with several
American flags, one Bicentennial
flag, and several posters which
might be considered tasteful de-
pending on one’s views of the
Democratic field of prospective
nominees.

In one corner of the room is
a large metal box which holds
the switching circuitry for the
four telephones in the room.
There are also several desks and
filing eabinets and the other ac-
couterments of modern bureau-
cracy. In the center of the room
is a long conference table where

appear uncomfortable and out of
place amidst the filth and enough
style to emphasize that one with
her money doesn’t need to “fit in”
anywhere. Ms. Taylor charact-
erizes Clare with a quiet determi-
nation; unfortunately this is at
the expense of removing all ve-
hemence, power, and animism
from the character. Although I
agree that Clare is somewhat in-
human, a figure of evil, a patch-
work of artificial limbs, I see a
certain “justice” in her vengeance,
Although perverse to the ex-
treme, her “justice” is one of the
central paradoxes of the play:

formation on the committee and
its functions.

“The SCC works through and
with the Executive Committee to
determine those cases that in-
volve Honor Code violations and
those that require other forms of
disciplinary action,” according to
Gary Seldomridge, chairman of
the committee.

Seldomridge continued by say-
ing that the committee acts and
investigates all complaints of stu-
dent misconduct which are not
under the jurisdiction of the EC,
“Most of the time it is pretty

In the coming weeks, God,

uled to get off its lackadaisical
track, and begin running pro-
files of the several committees
represented around that long gray
table every Sunday, and try to

clear-cut which actions are under
our command and which actions
are under control by the EC,”
he said.

The SCC at W&L is unique in
the sense that it is run by the
students for the students, and the
only way the system can success-
fully function is if student honor
is maintained. “The committee
works well because of the trust
the students put in us as well as
in their fellow students,” said
Seldomridge.

SCC jurisdiction extends to all
student conduct in Lexington and
Rockbridge County, at surround-
ing colleges, and at any Univer-
sity-related activity, wherever
held. This would cover athletic
events at other colleges, and
definitely includes University
housing, according to Lewis John,
Dean of Students. “The commit-
tee’s jurisdiction covers the
Woods Creek apartments, just as
it covers the dormitories,” said
John. “Both types of housing are
University-owned and controlled,
and both fall under the same
regulations and supervision.”

When the committee receives
a complaint of student miscon-
duct, the normal procedure is to
notify the student of the charges
and instruct him to appear be-
fore the committee. The complaint
is considered, investigated, and
acted upon by the committee. A
two-thirds vote of those commit-
tee members present is required
for a finding of student mis-
conduct; thereupon a penalty is
decided by a simple majority
vote.

If the SCC determines that a
student should be penalized, the

secret delight in going to the
“Grill,” late at night, to view
the often bizzare, motley-clad
locals, who found its Mordor-like
inner recesses a congenial place
to alight for the evening.

The establishment now occupy-

ing the late “Corner Grill” is
called, as I've indicated, the
“Good Trencherman Deli” (it

would have been a good joke to
retain the former name). The
interior has been completely
renovated, and painted a sani-
tary white. The decor remains a
bit stark, especially when com-
pied to the turn-of-the-century
motif of the “Palm Parlor’ down
the street; no doubt plans exist
to enliven the walls a bit. The
mot delightful surprise was the
hackground music; one does not
even expect background music in
Lexington, and this was not of
the objectionable 101-Strings-den-
tist-office variety, but rather mel-
low Gershwinesque jazz piano.

While recently visiting for
lunch, I had my favorite deli
sandwich, Pastrami, and a mug
of coffee, The pastrami was pass
able, though it could have been
leaner. My coffee mug was kept
full by the waitress, a fine restau
rant practice, and the service was
efficient by local standards, even
though the luncheon crowd was
large

The menu includes sandwiches,
salads and cheeses. A nice touch
to the beverage list is cider, and
application has been made for a
liquor license

In sum, the “Treneherman”
has the potential to offer a good
lunch or dinner in comfortable
surroundings, and | suspect the
proprietors are truly concerned
with doing things right. You
should go in expecting to pay over
two dollars. The hours are 11 am
to 7pm. and cold-cuts are avail
able by the pound at the counter

Generals snap long winning
streak, succumbing to ODU

By SAMMY THOMPSON

Washington and Lee’s basket-
ball team won its 13th game in a
row last week before losing to
Old Dominion University in Nor-
folk Saturday.

Thursday the Generals beat
Emory and Henry College by the
lopsided score, 98-53.

Six players ended up in double
figures for the Generals and the
team as a whole outshot their
opponents from the floor, 48 per
cent to 28 per cent.

W&L did not waste any time
getting started as they grabbed a
6-0 lead two minutes and 15 sec-
onds into the first half. Mike Clark
and Jerry Stewart kept Emory and
Henry close in the first half, how-
ever, and the Generals led by 10
points at intermission.

half, it was all W&L. The Gen-
erals scored nine straight points
before an E&H player connected
with a free throw to make the
score 40-22 in favor of W&L.
Head coach Verne Canfield de-
cided to ease up on his op-
ponents most of the second half
by substituting freely. To his sur-
prise, however, the W&L lead
only increased.

Don Berlin led all scorers with
16 points followed by Pat Dennis
(14), John Podgajny (13), Bob
Flint (12), Chris Larson (11) and
Norm Kristoff (11).

The Generals, led by Flint with
10, outrebounded E&H, 63-45.

Saturday W&L traveled to Nor-
folk looking for their 16th win of
the year against defending Di-
vision II national champion Old
Dominion University.

Old Dominion had a tough time
in the first half as they shot a
miserable 17.1 per cent from the
floor. W&L Captain John Podgajny
was the leading scorer at the half
and the Generals led, 30-24.

In the second half Old Do-
minion came alive, however. Joey
Caruthers hit five of his first
second half shots to tie the game
at 32 all. At the 12:37 mark he
made a layup that gave ODU the
lead for good.

Podgajny had 17 points for the
Generals and Flint had 14. Four
players finished in double figures
for ODU. Caruthers led all scor-
ers with 22. The final score was
ODU 78, W&L 66.

The Generals now have a 15-4
record and a chance to clinch the
Virginia College Athletic Associa-
tion (VCAA) championship, A win
over Christopher Newport Tues-
day and Eastern Mennonite Thurs-
day would give them the title.
Both games are being played in
Doremus Gym at 8 p.m.

Crytzer retains state crown
Generals place third in tourney

By KENNETH MASTRILLI

Team captain Jimmy Crytzer
successfully defended his state
championship crown at 158 pounds
as W&L placed four wrestlers in
the finals of the VCAA state
tournament. Although they
wrestled admirably the Generals
only managed to finish a close
third in the overall standings.

Of the seven teams entered
WA&L totaled 67% points behind
team champion George Mason's
86 and runner-up Madison's 68%.
Other teams behind the Generals
were Virginia State 49%, host
Eastern Mennonite 19'2, Hamp-
den-Sydney 16 3/4 and Lynchburg
11%.

Lee Keck at 134, Graham
Hudgins at 142, and Kevin Me-
Fadden at 150 all wrestled well
before losing in the finals of their
particular matches. Rick Heldrich

Only 21 more days, folks, till you-know-what season

Lacrosse season is almost here.

Head coach Jack Emmer said
the final team cut should come
this weekend and would leave him
with about 33 players.

The season opens March 5 at
North Carolina State and March
6 at Duke University. The first

are the only two seniors from last
year’s team that were lost to
graduation.

The General’s offense will be
led once again by Donnie Carroll
and Rob Morgan. Last year Car-
roll led the team in total points
with 40 goals and 45 assists for

Charlie Brown, who had 146 saves
in the goal.

The midfield will be better this
year but still will be W&L’s least
experienced position.

Last year’s leading faceoff men,
Rick Kulp and Brent Miller, are
not out for the team this year.

 

at 167, Bob Rogers at 177, Steve
Schweizerhof at 190 and heavy-
weight Dan Kniffen all won their
consolation finals matches for
third place.

Just threedays before’ the
VCAA meet, W&L scored one of
its biggest and most unexpected
victories of the current season
with a convincing 28-12 victory
over Madison College, the defend-
ing VCAA champions. After los-
ing the first two matches, W&L
was trailing at one point in the
match by a score of 7-0, but then
came on to win six of the last
8 matches.

WEL swimmers
despite relay team

The swimming team won just
four of 13 events but could still
defeat host American University
by winning the last event, the 400-
yard freestyle relay, last Satur-
day in Washington, D.C.

The Generals’ four-man team
then posted its best time of the
year (3:18.87) and easily qualified
for the NCAA national champion-
ship meet. But W&L lost both the
race and the meet as American’s
team swam a 3:17.4.

En route to the dramatic finish,
W&L had outstanding perform-
ances from John Hudson, who won
both the 200-yard and 500-yard
freestyle events, and Billy Cogar,
who swept both diving events.
Both have qualified for the na-
tional meet, along with the 400-
yard relay team of Keith Romich,
Hudson, Tad Van Leer and Gary
Seldomridge.

Hudson remains undefeated in
his freestyle specialties and now
leads the nation in Division II in
three events—the 200, 500 and
1000 freestyle.

The Generals, now 6-2 in dual
meets, take to the road this week-
end to meet Old Dominion Friday
and always strong University of
Richmond Monday.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

J-prof warns of TV abuses

The enormously useful potential
of international television broad-
casting by satellite is in danger of
being entirely lost to narrow
political interests and power
structures, according to a retired
W&L journalism professor—and
a major share of the blame, he
says, should be placed with the
world’s intellectual community
for its indifference in the face of
the problem.

The observations are made by
O. W. Riegel, who taught journ-
alism here for 43 years until re-
tiring in 1973, in a new anthology
of articles presented to the ninth
General Assembly of the Inter-
national Association for Mass
Communication Research.

In the essay, Riegel expresses
alarm at the apparently unchal-
lenged trend among the world’s
governments—especially those of
“the so-called ‘underdeveloped’
nations’—to view international
television communication as a
tool of political self-interest.

Riegel notes his keen disap-
pointment in the United Nations,
particularly with UNESCO, “a
body presumably dedicated to the
expansion of the knowledge and
experience of all the people of
the world.”

He points to a single UNESCO-
sponsored resolution, adopted by
the United Nations General As-
sembly in 1972, which “proclaims
at one and the same time (a) the
sanctity of world freedom of in-
formation, and (b) the right of
governments to interfere unilat-
erally with communications at any

time for what they claim to be
‘self-defense’.”

The future of direct satellite
broadcasting, he declares, is in
jeopardy of being lost to “power
politics, suspicion, fear and the
arguments of the lawyers.”

Particularly disturbing, Riegel
observes, is the failure of the
world’s scholars to develop ways
to influence these policies by
means of objective research into
ways new technology can be used
“to increase the flow of informa-
tion” by satellite broadcasting
and parallel ways to identify and
alert “the ordinary people of the
world’—as distinguished from
governments—about the nature
of policies which “tend to re-
strict such a flow.”

In new nations in particular, he
says, governments “apparently
propose to seal off a possible new

window to the world before it is
even opened . .. New communica-
tions facilities have been man-
-yleajs pue posi, ‘jueq ‘pease
jacketed in the interests of op-
pressive nationalistic oligarchies
whose paramount concern is not
the enlightenment of their peoples
but their own self-preservation.”

Riegel concludes that if there
exists a consensus among the
world’s scholars based on both
research and “conscience,” it must
be used to “press its judgments
and recommendations upon na-
tional leaders and the world pub-
lic.”

The alternative, he predicts, is
that the international intellectual
community can ‘wait for the ac-
complished fact, and then in the
tradition of ‘scholarship’ produce
inventories, analyses, schematics
—or, perhaps, an epitaph.”

(Continued from page 2)
play through his physical appear-
ance as well as his speech. His
accurate portrayal of Schill led
me to a _ perception of Clare
and his fate and a judgment of
Guellen’s townfolk.

The supporting roles in “The
characters who represent the
Visit” are crucial; they are the
town’s self image. As the School
teacher, Dan Scott lends the play
enough of a humanist plea to
seize our sympathy in Schill’s
favor. The God-forsaken nature of
Guellen was aptly presented by
Lecky Stone as the Priest. Though
we expect moral strength, the
Priest is a man unable to resist
the temptation Clare places in
front of him.

Less pleasing were the roles of
the Burgomaster and the Police-
man played by Warren Mowry
and John Hollinger respectively.
Each of these roles demands a

student may appeal the case to
the Student Affairs Committee
within 48 hours. The SAC, a stu-
dent-faculty committee under the
aegis of the University Council
which aets as a review board, may
alter the findings or penalty of
the committee in any manner
whatsoever.

One of the difficulties that the
SCC presents, according to Sel-
domridge, is that it is difficult
to discipline a fellow student. But
problems that were expected in
this area have not developed, as
Dean John explains. “Originally,
every SCC decision had to go to
the SAC, and the SAC had to
review and act upon each and
every disciplinary matter,” said
John. “When the procedure was
revised, and every SCC decision
was not subjected to review,
there were fears that the SCC
would not be hard enough on stu-
dents, since Student Control is a
student-only committee.” It has
frequently worked out the other
way, with SCC handing down stiff
penalties, which the SAC oe-
casionally feels obligated to re-
duce.

“In most cases which are ap-
pealed, the SAC has either up-
held or lightened the penalties,’
continued John. ‘These fears
were unfounded, as te SCC has
dealt fairly, yet wit sufficient
firmness, in matters o° discipline.”

The basic penalties which can
be imposed upon individuals
found guilty of misconduct in-
clude:

1) Monetary fines in amounts

up to $5.

2) Social Probation.

3) Dormitory Probation,

4) Specific tasks related to the
nature of the misconduct.

5) Reprimand.

The SCC can also, in extraordi-
nary cases, recommend to the
SAC that a student be suspended
or expelled from the University,
but the SCC itself does not have
the power to take such drastic
action. Recommendations of this
magnitude appear to be rare.

Dean John believes that one of
the main strengths in the system
is that it is totally student-run
at the SCC level, and Seldomridge
agrees. “The system is unique at
W&L in that all business is con-
ducted by the students,” said
Seldomridge, “and this creates a
‘genuine’ student government.”

One area that still needs resolu-
tion is the delineation between
matters that should be handled by
the IFC and those that should be
dealt with by the SCC.

John feels that overall the sys-
tem has worked quite well, par-
ticularly since composition of the
SCC was altered to include elect-
ed class officers; he noted that the
SCC has acted responsibly in
nearly all matters.

“We try to emphasize the im-
portance of the individual in a
trustworthy nature,” said Seldom-
ridge. “We are not a police force
but rather a committee designed
to help the students and help to
incorporate the _ institutional
philosophy.”

tight discipline befitting their
positions as “enforcers of justice.”
Though the roles seem to have
great comic potential they were
played halfway between the comic
and the tragic, rather farcical. It’s
as if the actors tried to keep them-
selves in both of these dramatic
worlds and ended up falling
through the abyss which lies be-
tween.

Such a confusion permeated
the whole play. At the heart of
this production of “The Visit’ lies
a failure to define the play. Is it
tragic? Or is it comic? Are we to
be aghast at Aaton’s fate? Does
Clare align her version of justice
with his cruel fate? Does she spin
the web of Anton’s fate and then
cut the thread?

Or is Clare a human extension
of the moral infirmity of all men?
Is Clare human?

At times the action of the play
unravels so furiously that one
can't help but feel the actors will
collapse in a loud and dusty heap
in the middle of the stage. This
is when it is at its best. At other
times the play slows down to the
pace of a meander. The only
effect of this changing rhythm was

jor Carter issue, however. Carter
defines the most crucial issue as
unemployment. In addition he
promises federal administration
of welfare, reduced defense spend-
ing, an honest government, a
solution to the energy crisis, tax
reform, and better health care.

The issues are proving at-
tractive not only to New Hamp-
shire voters, but also to the
people in other primary states.
For Carter, the key primaries, be-
sides New Hampshire, are New
York, Pennsylvania, and Illinois.
Carter is reducing his Massachu-
set's effort so that he can spend
more time and money against
Wallace in the Florida primary.

Carter’s success in these states
will no doubt be important when
the real Democratic Presidential
Convention opens later this year.
But chanees are that by the time
that body meets, Carter will al-
ready have received the nod from
W&L’s own Democratic conven-
tion.
