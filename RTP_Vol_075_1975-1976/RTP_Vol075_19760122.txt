‘A Salute to Hollywood’
is Fancy Dress theme

By RYLAND OWEN

The 69th Annual Fancy Dress
Weekend will be held February
26-27, according to the Student
Activities Board. The theme for
(his vear’s activities, comparative-
ly unique since it has no bicenten-
nial significance, will be “A Sa-
lute to Hollywood.” Tickets for
the weekend's activities will be

on sale the first week in February.
Each ticket will cost ten dollars
in advance and $12 at the door.
Fancy Dress Weekend will start
off with a dance at the Pavillion,
with The Marvelettes providing
the music. The dance will have
the same status as a regular com-
bo party; in other words, no for-
mal dress will be required and a

Cook asks EC for veep,
reports threatened suit

By JOE FITZGERALD
Assistant News Editor

Rodney Cook, president of the
class of °78, came before the Exe-
cutive Committee Monday night
to ask them to appoint David
Lowe, one of the two sophomore
representaives on the University
Council, to fill the seat of sopho-
more class vice-president, vacated
by the departure of David Bau-
man.

Cook asked that the E.C. ap-
point Lowe because the UC.
member has the support of the
class, as evidenced by his election
last Spring, and because he is
someone Cook says he can work
with well in the possible troubles
the sophomore class may have to
face later.

The class has been threatened
with an $1800 lawsuit from the
band who played at the Home-
coming Grain Party, a party spon-
sored by the sophomore class. The
hand members are claiming dam-
ages to their equipment and ve-
hicles.

According to Cook, the only vis-
ible damage to the band’s machi-
nery was a slashed screen on one
of the speakers. Cook also said
(hat Bauman told a member of
the band that the sophomore class

Student Center at 7:45 p.m. on

would be responsible for the dam-
age.

Cook said he had hired a law-
yer for the class to handle the
case.. The class has $1300 in its
budget, $500 of which was left
over from last year’s funds after
the class held a Fancy Dress Grain
Party, as well as two beer parties
for the freshmen in the Spring.

The E.C. declined to favor
Cook’s request, deciding instead
to hold a special election on Feb-
ruary 2nd to fill the post.

The decision to hold an election
was one of three options discussed
by the E.C. The other choices were
to appoint someone to take the
position until the general election
on March 22nd, or to leave the
seat empty until that date.

The choice of leaving the office
vacant was at first voted in by the
E.C. but then rejected on a revote.

The option of appointing some-
one was considered but defeated
in a vote on the matter. The E.C.
decided to hold the election by a
vote of 9-2.

“bring your own” policy will be
in effect. The dance will com-
mence at 8:30 on Thursday night.

Friday night, The Fabulous
Jimmy Dorsey Orchestra, directed
by Lee Castle, will be playing at
Evans Dining Hall. The orchestra
has recently completed successful
engagements in Atlantic City and
New York. Free beer will be avail-
able at the bar.

In the E. C. Room, the movie
“That’s Entertainment” will be
shown continually throughout the
evening.

Edwin Barron, a “master hy-
pnotist,” will demonstrate various
feats of hypnotism in an audience
participation show. The hypno-
tism show will take place in the
T.V. Room of the student center.

Old newsreels and cartoon first
= will be shown in Room

In addition to the orchestra in
Evans Dining Hall, Co-chairman
Terry Atwood promises there will
be “a prominent jazz band” play-
ing in the Cockpit.

A professional photographer,
Tom Bradshaw, will be in the Stu-
dent Center library Friday night.
All couples wishing to have pic-
tures taken should make arrange-
ments with him at that time.

 

Big time comedy comes to Lexington on Friday as the touring Na-
tional Lampoon Show plays at Doremus Gymnasium at 9 p.m.
Some of the highlights of the show are its parodies of presidential

prison life on some of the Watergate conspirators. Admission is $1.

MG damaged,
prank termed
“practical joke”

By BOB CHIAVIELLO

Over $500 worth of damage was
done to a student’s car in the
parking lot of the ZBT house dur-
ing a party Saturday night.

As a practical joke, several stu-
dents were moving the car, an MG,
when they were joined by another
group, reportedly from the SAE
house.

Students from each group be-
gan pounding on the car before
being discouraged by their more
sober companions. The car was
left with extensive damage to the
hood and sides and the owner was
left with a $512 damage bill.

The owner of the car reported
it to both student and local au-
thorities. At least one member has
been interviewed by the police.
The matter is presently being in-
vestigated by the Student Control
Committee.

The student’s father has report-
edly threatened criminal charges
if the University’s punishment is
not severe enough.

The student is frequently the
subject of practical jokes, such as
having his car placed on the side
walk. According to one of the stu-
dents involved, “He’s not very
popular as it is.”

Kappa, the national leadership
society, at an assembly on Mon-
day.

Ten undergraduates and three
law students were also elected to
membership in the organization,
which was founded at W&L in
1914. Omicron Delta Kappa now
has chapters on more than 100
college campuses throughout the
nation.

The induction of the two hon-
orary members — both graduates
of Washington and Lee —and the
13 students took place at a joint
convocation marking the birthday
of Robert E. Lee and W&L’s
Founders’ Day. Dr. William W.
Pusey III, head of the German de-

partment and former dean of The
College and acting president in
1967-68, delivered the principal
address, “Robert E. Lee: The Im-
plausible Magician,” a study of
Lee’s impact on the curriculum at
Washington College during his
years as president from 1965 un-
til his death in 1870.

Dr. Pusey remarked upon the
devastating effects of the War Be-
tween the States on Washington
College. Higher education thro-
ughout the South wa sin a state of
chaos, and the college was kept
alive only through the determin-
ed efforts of its faculty. By the
time the fighting had stopped,
conditions at the school were so
bad as to cause one observer to

Wallace injury slows campaign

By PHILIP HATCHETT

In every presidential election
year Alabama Governor George
C. Wallace musters up enough
political strength to die a slow
death. And 1976 proves to be p-
exception.

Bill Brawley of the Jackson for
President campaign seemed to
speak for the majority of cam-
paign offices in Washington when
he said, “Whatever Wallace gets
in the primaries and state conven-
lions is all he can hope for; be
that his usual 15-18%. He'll start
losing delegates after that.”

But even this year’s usual grass-
roots support appears to be in jeo-
pardy. For the first time in his
political career Wallace is being
challenged for that expected 15-
18°% by fellow Southerner Jimmy
Carter and Washington Senator
Henry Jackson.

For Wallace the first big test
will come on March 2 in the Mass-
achusetts primary. Wallace is hop-
ing to cash in on the present un-
popular forced busing issue in
Boston. As Wallace said on the
day he announced his candidacy,
“The issue is of forced busing
(and) the answer to forced busing
is to stop it.”

Notice

Petitions are now being accept
ed for the position of sophomore
class vice-president Petitions
should be in the E.C. room by 7
p.m. Monday, Jan. 26. They should
have 50 signatures of persons in
the sophomore class and the can
didate must be willing to attend
the E.C. meeting this Monday
night. The E.C. wishes to make
clear that the person elected to
this position will have no legal
liahilities in any eases involving
the sophomore class

Although the Boston people are
against foreed busing, they don’t
seem to be in favor of Wallace. In
a survey of five television stations
in the Boston area, the general
consensus is that Wallace has fail-
ed to make the voters put aside
their natural liberal tendencies to
crusade against busing.

One reason for the apparent
failure in Massachusetts is the un-
satisfactory nature of the cam-
paign in the Bay State. Wallace
shifted from his standard shop-
ping center-carnival type appear-
ances to a low-key media cam-
paign with a multitude of taped
television interviews.

From the start the press has
questioned this strategy, asking
if it could be due to health rea-
sons. Since the May shooting three
and a half years ago, Wallace has
accumulated many medical com-
plications. The governor is paraly-
zed from the wasit down, making
his brittle legs susceptible to in
jury. In fact when he broke his

Counselor

Applications are invited for the
positions of Freshman and Up
perelass Dormitory Counselors for
the 1976-77 academic year, These
posiiions are considered to be
wneng the most responsible en
trusted to Washington and Lee
students

On the basis of past experience,
certain guidelines for the selec
tion of Dormitory Counselors have
been established, Applicants must
be at least current sophomores,
and should not have routine com
mitments after 8:00 p.m. that
would normally take them from
the dormitory for any appreciable
time

While
awarded on an academic basis, a

eounselorships are not

left leg this summer, Wallace
didn’t realize it for several days.
Moreover the Alabamian suffers
from poor hearing, spasmodic
pains around the waist and the
loss of bladder control. Still his
personal doctors believe he is cap-
able of withstanding the trauma
of a campaign and the pressures
of the office he pursues.

To counter the persistent health
question, Wallace is changing his
campaign style for his second
major hurdle. Last week Wallace
initiated a schedule of 25 personal
appearances in Florida before the
March 9 primary. Wallace captur-
ed 42° of the vote in '72 but that
phenomenon will be hard to dup-
licate. Jimmy Carter will spend a
total of 45 days in the state com-
pared to the 20-22 days by Wal-
lace. However the governor still
expects a majority of delegates.

This time around the Wallace
campaign staff knows the dele-
gate selection rules. That misin-

note that its only remaining as-
sets were a long and distinguish-
ed history, and a picturesque land-
scape.

Gen. Lee’s acceptance of the
college’s presidency, according to
Pusey, caused the most startling
and dramatic turnaround in the
school’s history. Enrollment shot
up as young men from all over
the South were attracted by the
prestige afforded by Lee's pres-
ence. Many changes and innova-
tions were instituted, many of
them authored by Lee himself and
all of them bearing his unmis-
takable influence and stamp of
approval.

Dr. Pusey listed some of Gen.
Lee’s notable accomplishments,
including: nine separate schools
of study, with a limited program
of electives; five new professor-
ships; merging with a local law
school: expansion of the business
school to include agriculture,
chemistry, and commerce, and the
hiring of several graduate assis-
tants. Particularly remarkable,
noted Dr. Pusey, were Lee’s pro-
gram of scholarships to local men
in pursuit of journalistic train-
ing, and his abolishment of man-
datory Chapel attendance.

Pusey gave several reasons for
the University’s steep decline af-
ter Lee's death. The emergence of
other Southern colleges, the new
emphasis on scholarship and re-
search at new schools like Johns
Hopkins, and the lack of involve-
ment on the part of President
Custis Lee led to a faculty and
student exodus, and the conse-
quent decline in revenues left the
University in a state of depres-
sion for many years.

Following Pusey's remarks, th»
new members of ODK were call-
ed forward for recognition.

In order to insure their greatest
possible availability to counselees,
counselors are provided with a

Executive buffoonery

There are times when we wonder whether the members of
the Executive Committee have ever read the Student Body

can read, but that is not the subject here. The subject is
is required to fill an elective office that be-

they go about filling it.

The question came up Monday night at the i.C. meeting
when Rodney Cook, president of the sophomore class, reported
that David Bauman, vice-president of that class, had left the
University. Cook asked that the E-.C. appoint one of the sopho-
more University Council representatives to the position for the
remainder of the year.

The decision of what to do about the vacancy might have
been easy to resolve if not for two factors: the v.p. of each
class is a member of the Student Control Committee, and the
band that played the Homecoming Cocktail Party in Red
Square is threatening to sue the sophomore class for damage
done to their equipment and vehicles during the party.

The question led to a parliamentary quagmire. Jim Under
hill moved that the E.C.
stitution and appoint someone to fill the post until the general
March 22.
Pugh moved that the E.C

invoke Article 5 section f of the Con
election on His motion was defeated and Bobby
_ for the first time in recorded his
tory, do nothing. The vote in favor of doing nothing was five
to three with three abstentions. This led to quibbling over
whether that was a legal margin in favor of inactivity, and
by the time the E.C. decided that the vote was sufficient, Jim
Underhill had called for a revote, which defeated the motion,
which led to a motion to hold a general election on Feb. 2,
which led Mynders Glover to ask if they were just going to
appoint some “buffoon” to fill the office, which led Gary Sel
domridge to speak up and say that the Student Control Com
mittee did not want just any buffoon joining its ranks, which
led Bobby

and members of student committee) and

Bobby Pugh mentioning that “It would be nice to have the
class choose” their own vice-president. Pugh later added, “I
don't like sophomores anyway.’

One would have to have seen the debate to appreciate the
true farcical quality of the proceedings, which proved one
again that while this lofty board is perfeetly capable of givin

away money to damn near anvone who asks for it, en a real

problem arises the I.C, is likely to be caught with its khaki
down, wondering why General Lee did not put anything
about this in his memoirs.

“May I help you?”

“Yes, I’d like a ‘Bagpipe’.”

“All right, that'll be $1.40.”

“May I help you?”

“I'd like a ‘Mombo’.”

“That'll be $1.35.”

A “Bagpipe”? “Mombo”? No,
it is not Scotland or some distant
planet with some bizarre langu-
age. It is the Palm Parlor Ice
Cream Cafe on the corner of
Jefferson and Nelson streets.

Up two steps and suddenly
enter the Victorian era with
palms and ferns (including a big
100-year-old Boston fern in one
corner), two fans hanging from
the ceiling, a row of six hanging
globe lights and a shiny wood
plank floor.

But that’s not all. There are
bamboo curtains over the win-
dows and on the back wall, a row
of early 20th century pictures on

one, several small round
wooden tables accompanied by
four metal parlor-type chairs

apiece, two snuff advertisements
and finally a display of the ice
cream at least 25 flavors.
Among these delectables are cho-
colate chunk, rum raisin, rainbow
and dutch apple, to name a few.

Behind the counter is a huge
mirror surrounded by an extrava-
gant wooden frame (only adding
to the turn of the century-late Vic-
torian atmosphere), On the count-
er is a stack of hand printed me-
nus. Inside is a list of sandwiches
(among these, a “Dagwood” and
“Coney Dogs”) and ice cream
creations including the aforemen-
tioned “Bagpipe” and “Mombo”
as well as a “Black Cow,” an “Am-
brosia Shake” (“shake of the
gods”), a “Bicentennial Parfait”
and a “Georgetowner.”

Behind the counter stand one
or two of the seven employees.
One may be a short 23-year-old
man with sandy blond collar-
length wavey hair and a thick
matching beard. He’s Doug Hig-
gins, a °73 VCU graduate and the
Palm Parlor owner.

Higgins received a degree in
art, was a substitute teacher in
Richmond for about six months
and traveled “from Nova Scotia to
the Keys” before settling down in
the ice cream business in Lexing-
ton.

He chose Lexington to set up his
business because his grandmother
(the contributor of the 100-year-
old Boston fern) lives here and his

father came from here. Besides,
“T just wanted to get away from
big cities,” he said.

The Palm Parlor opened Aug.
4. Higgins said the transition from
Ray Miller’s “Den of Antiquities”
to the Palm Parlor took about
two months.

It was an expensive project. Ac-
cording to Higgins, the initial re-
novation cost the most, but the
restaurant equipment ran a close
second.

Higins selected the turn-of-the-
century-late-Victorian atmosphere
because “that’s when ice cream
was in its hey day. It was big busi-
ness, as American as the Ameri-
can flag, you know, the national

%,

pastime — the whole bit.’

Higgins said the business is do-
ing well. The Parlor is breaking
even now but Higgins said that it
will enter the profit-making stage
soon.

By the way, a “Bagpipe” con-
sists of “butter pecan, vanilla and
black walnut ice cream covered
with butterscotch and marshmal-
low and crowned with mounds of
whipped cream and a cluster of
crushed pecans.” A ‘“Mombo’’ is
simply a “scoop of banana and va-
nilla ice cream laced with rasp-
berry and chocolate topping, toast-
ed almonds and our own ‘Jamai-
can Magic’ with whipped cream
and cherries.”

The title of this column is not
an attempt to plagiarize the title
of a Chicago song. It is an at-
tempt to capture the scope of the
Mock Convention, an event where-
by three and a half years of
planning goes into spending 32,-
000 dollars in 48 hours.

The column will be a regular
feature of the Ring-tum Phi be-
tween now and May. It’s purpose
is to keep an eye on the progress
of the preparaitons for the Mock
Convention, and to answer any
questions our readers may have
about the quadrennial game of
political prediction. Persons hav-
ing questions about the Mock
Convention or comments on this

floor of Reid Hall. Just drop them
in the box marked Edit/Opin.

The personnel of the Athletic
Department must have bad dreams
every night about the idea of

a few of the delegates imbibing

\ few years later, when | was
accepted at W&L, I received a
note from one of the fraternities,
first welcoming me to “The Coun-
try Club” and, secondly, warning
me that I would have to run a
mile and a half in less than twelve
minutes, After I read that, the
rest of my summer was not quite
the same. I was determined to
pass the test the first time and
underwent a vigorous (for me)
training program. I went to the
track every morning from that
day on, trying to run at least a
mile a day. I usually ended up
walking at least half that amount.

Convention, there wil be no such
problems during this year’s
event. Besides the damage that
might be done to the facilities,
there is also the effect that
alcohol might have on the dele-
gates’ determination for accuracy.
Wolf (as well as the _ political
chairman for the ’72 MC) specu-
lated that the MC making its first
wrong choice in 24 years in '72
may have been due to an inability
to concentrate on political matters
in the jovial atmosphere that pre-
vailed on the floor. People may
have chosen Kennedy just to get
the thing over with.

While Wolf agreed with my
belief that drinking is one of the
fun parts of the Mock Conven-
tion, he said people will have to
be more discreet about it this
time. There will be tighter se-
curity on the floor, a whole squad
of Mock Secret Servicemen, pre-
sumably out-of-season football
jocks with no tests coming up,

From the

White Book

The accused “shall be told that
the purpose of the Committee is to
ascertain the facts of the case and
not to prosecute him, that he may
call witnesses who possess perti-
nent information concerning the
matter, and that the Vice-Presi-
dent of the Student Body shall be
his technical advisor.”

He “shall be permitted to re-
main present throughout the ques-
tioning of witnesses and all other
proceedings of the Executive Com-
mittee hearing except the delib-
eration of the Executive Commit-
tee, which can occur at any time.”

  

(see notice elsewhere in_ this
paper) patrolling the floor in
silk-sereen T-shirts bearing the
word “GUARD.”

The MC people may also print
up some silk-screen T-shirts for
general consumption, both to
raise money and to help with the
job of getting students interest-
ed in the Mock Convention. One
has to wonder what will go on
these T-shirts that will gather
the attention of the student body
and make them wear the things.
The Mock Convention logo might
work but it looks too much like
the American flag, and wearing
the Stars and Stripes went out
when “Easy Rider” made its last
theater run.

Perhaps they could take a cue
from the ’72 convention and re-
print a panel from “O Wicked

Wanda” showing Ted Kennedy
waist deep in water, grinning,

spreading his arms to the masses,
and wearing a button saying “76.”

Black Awareness Week finale

 

Although Black Awareness Week went by without the fanfare seen
in past years, the Black Ball (above) was as vigorous as ever. The
annual tribute to Black culture this year included William Syp-
hax, a leading black businessman, and imamu Amira Baraka, the
former Leroi Jones, a poet, dram atist, and author.

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

After two issues the W&L Thy-
mes has ceased to exist. The major
difficulty of the Thymes was in
feting participation from the stu
dents. Many had criticized the es
tablished publications for not
meeting the needs of the students
and wished for something more
so the Thymes was formed with
this express purpose, that it would
be a medium of student opinion
We learned quickly that though
almost everyone does have an
opinion, few feel strongly enough

This letter is addressed to those

As a resident of Lexington, |

would like to urge you to PLEASE
put dogs in a kennel while
you gone for weekends and
holidays, instead of boarding
them with families. It is
MOST exasperating to listen to a
dog, large or small, bark for hours
on end while he is on a leash. I
really don't believe this is the care

I should like to take this oppor
tunity to thank the postal workers
in Lexington, Va. for their help to
the many Washington and Lee stu
dents who rent postal boxes. Last
July ist, the rates of those boxes
rose from $5 to $14. Many of us
rented the boxes at the old rate
and have now been confronted
with the post office's request for
payment of the remaining $9.00
Thanks to the Lexington office
W&L students will not have to pay
the increased portion that cover
ed July to thereby re
sulting in a saving of $4.50 per
student. Students will be re
quired to pay for only the portion
covering January Ist to whenever
their box expires

Baum, Flint, Podgajny lead in win

By SAMMY THOMPSON

For all of you sports fans who
were somewhere other than the
W&L basketball game Saturday
night, The Generals won their
sixth straight game by beating
Virginia Wesleyan 77-62 and are
now tied with them for first place
in VCAA league competition.

Head Coach Verne Canfield cre
dits Jeff Baum, Bob Flint and cap-
tain John Podgajny as the reason
for the Generals’ latest success.

Canfield had plenty of good
things to say about Baum, a 6-5
senior from Carlisle, Pa. “He has
added mobility and has played
good defense,’ Canfield — said.
Baum is one of the leading re-
bounders on the team.

“Flint has been the most con-
‘istent player for us.” Canfield
said. “He has some of the best
inside moves on the team.” Flint

is the team’s leading rebounder
and is also the team leader in
steals.

Podgajny has provided good
leadership and is the most accur-
ate shooter on the team, Canfield
said.

The Generals have had to play
without the services of two key
players lately in Norm Kristoff
and Bob Forlenza. Kristoff has not

seen action since January 9 and
Forlenza was just recently injur-
ed in practice.

3ut this year’s depth has aided
the Generals so far. Canfield not-
ed, however, that W&L basically
has a very young team. Freshmen
starters Mike Wenke and Dave
Leunig attribute to this fact.

Saturday night the “Blue Mar-
lins” from Virginia Wesleyan were
totally outplayed by W&L. After
trailing 8-6 early in the game,
Chris Larson came off the bench
and scored 8 straight points to
give the Generals the lead for
good.

W&L took a 9-point lead with
7:16 left after three straight bas-
kets by Podgajny, Kim Sims and
Don Berlin. The Generals’ defense
merits special credit in the first

Wrestlers post
win over H-S

The wrestling team increased
its season record to 4-2 with a 44-5
drubbing of Hampden-Sydney and
a 29-10 loss to George Mason in
action last week.

The Generals scored five pins in
easily outdistancing Hampden-
Sydney. Pinning their opponents
for W&L were Howdy Knipp at
126, Lee Keck at 134, Graham
Hudgins at 142, Andy King of
Buena Vista at 150 and heavy-
weight Dan Kniffen. Scoring de-
cisions were Kevin McFadden of
Lexington at 167 and Rick Held-
rich at 177.

King also posted a superior de-
cision against his George Mason
opponent with an 11-3 decision,
while McFadden pulled out an 8-7
come-from-behind win at 150 and
Kniffen won at heavyweight, 8-2.

Keck and Kniffen have the best
overall records for W&L with 5-1
records, while close behind are
King and McFadden (both 4-1) and
team captain Jim Crytzer, 4-1-1.

half as Virginian Wesleyan scored
only 20 points. Canfield said four
different defenses were used in
the game which might have
thrown the Marlins out of bal-
ance.

The Generals wound up the
first half by holding Virginia Wes-
leyan scoreless for the last four
minutes while reeling off ten
straight points. This gave W&L a
38-20 half time lead.

Virginia Wesleyan hit only 32
per cent of their first-half field
goals compared to 53 per cent for
W&L. The Generals were a per-
fect 6-6 in free throws and wound
up 11-12 in the game. Chris Lar-
son jed the Generals’ scoring at-
tack in the half with 8 points
while Baum led in rebounds with
5. Mike Wenke played an excel-
lent half with 4 steals and 3 as-
sists.

The start of the second half saw
the Generals increase their lead to
20 points after a Podgajny hot
streak scoring three baskets in as
many attempts. The biggest mar-
gin was 22 points, however, at
12:25 after a layup by Art Col-
lins.

Canfield substituted freely after
that and the W&L lead fell slight-
ly. Butch Sheppard and Del Bat-
tle were hard to stop for W&L as
they scored 19 and 14 points re-
spectively. The Marlins started
coming back the last five minutes
of the game but it was too late.

The Generals held on for a 15-
point 77-62 win.

The Generals had three men in
double figures as Podgajny and
Larson each had 14 points while
Baum had 10. Bob Flint added 9
points and 5 rebounds. Mike Wen-
ke ended the game with 6 points,
6 steals and 4 assists for a fine de-
fensive effort. W&L shot a little
better than 50 per cent from the
field and only missed one free
throw in 12 attempts .

Canfield was satisfied after the
Generals’ victory but admitted
that the team’s best effort of the
year came last Wednesday in their
victory over Emory and Henry
College. The team’s record now
stands at 8-3.

There are still 15 games re-
maining in the Generals’ schedule
including four important contests
against Hampden-Sydney, Old Do-
minion, Madison, and Randolph-
Macon. Yesterday W&L traveled
to Eastern Mennonite College and
will face Hampden-Sydney Satur-
day afternoon at 2 p.m.

Spring football banned by NCAA

Washington and Lee’s annual
Spring Football Game, a popular
“good time” for athletic alumni,
was a victim of NCAA legislation
last week.

The National Collegiate Athletic

Swimmers take first loss

W&L swimming star John Hud-
son vastly improved his nation-
leading times in two events as the
Generals split a pair of meets last
week.

Iludson remained undefeated in
his specialties, the 500-yard and
1000-yard freestyles, as W&L
dropped its first meet of the sea-
son to strong Virginia Common-
wealth, 68-45 ,and then defeated
Davidson, 51-42. Hudson posted a
9:54.0 in the 1000, which is 9.3
seconds faster than any other col-
lege division swimmer in the coun-
try. His 4:45.93 in the 500 is 5.8
seconds ahead of anyone else in
the college division.

Tad Van Leer remained unde-
feated in the 50-yard freestyle as

he beat the defending state cham-
pion, VCU’s Tony Barney, in
Richmond. He also won the 100-
yard freestyle against Davidson.

Van Leer and Hudson teamed
with Keith Romich and Gary Sel-
domridge to post a 3:20.6 in the
400-yard freestyle relay, which
ranks third nationally among
Division III schools.

Coach Bill Stearns’ Generals,
now 4-1 for the year, will be host
to Baltimore Loyola Saturday in
Doremus Gym. The meet will be-
gin at 2:00 p.m.

Association (NCAA), in its annual
meeting in St. Louis, voted to
abolish spring football practice for
Division III schools. W&L tradi-
tionally concluded its spring foot-
ball practice with the annual Var-
sity-Alumni Game, which drew
scores of former football players
back to the campus for the event,
which included a post-game ban-
quet and social function.

The legislation also works an
unfair advantage for Division III
schools which play Division II
teams in football, since spring
practice was retained for Divisions
I and Il. W&L has two such op-
ponents in its schedule next sea-
son, Gettysburg and Millersville.

W&L also was affected by an-
other NCAA vote, to rescind team
squad limits and travel restric-
tions. The University has had such
limits of its own for many years,
but the NCAA ones—hastily pass-
ed at last year’s NCAA national

convention — were much more
strict.

W&L athletic director William
D. McHenry attended the NCAA
meeting in St. Louis and voted
against the ban on spring football
practice and for the lifting of the
travel and squad restrictions.

“We haven't yet received noti-
fication of all the changes that
took place in St. Louis,’ McHenry
commented, “but the abolition of
spring football practice and the
squad and travel limitations are
the ones that affect us most direct-
yy”

In clarifying his vote on spring
football practice, McHenry said
“I favor abolition of all out-of-
season practices for all sports,
and I feel that it is discriminatory
to ban spring practice for just one
division in football, while allow-
ing the other two divisions to con-
tinue their practices.”

Dining Hall manager Jerry Darrell wanted to do somaihing to include everyone eating in the Commons
in the SuperBowl. So Saturday night he set up a box and told people to predict the score of the game.
The winner was to win ten dollars. The only problen with the winner was there were three of them.
Darrell had said that in case of multiple winners, the money would be divided equally, but rather than
iry dividing a penny into thirds, he decided to give each winner five dolars. Pictured, from left to right,
are Darrell, Mike Powell, the box, Harold Royal, and Harold Fung.
