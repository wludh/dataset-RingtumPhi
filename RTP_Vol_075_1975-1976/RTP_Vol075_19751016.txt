Fraternal cosmetics
and alumni appeal

Over a period three days last week a select group of
Washington and Lee alumni attended a special series of con-
designed to aid them in understanding W&L as it
now exists. They came to Lexington still clinging to images
of the W&L of their day, but left with a better comprehension
of the W&L of our day.

Some of the returning graduates had not visited Lexington

ferences

lor many a year. In several instances individuals were shocked
by the lack of a uniform dress code and appalled at the lack
of gentility displayed by students toward one another (par-
ticularly in greeting one another on campus).

Several regulations concerning student conduct and dress
were dispensed with in the late 1960's, when students were
challenging all manner of rules and laws. The general spirit
of the gentleman remains, however, even though the coat
and tie is missing. Students today are no less worthy of being
called “gentlemen” than they ever were—this point was
stressed to the alumni.

One complaint aired by a significant portion of
tending the conference, and one which has been aired before

 

those at-

on several occasions, concerned the physical state of the fra-
houses. Many shocked by the de-
conditions found in and around some houses,

We find it hard to believe that things are so different now
from the days of earlier students. From what we can gather,
the physical condition of many houses was far from excellent
in most days gone by, and in one case an alumnus admitted
that his house had actually improved in its appearance.

Che point is well taken, though, that some work is in order
for present fraternity members. The city is currently involved
in a massive effort to beautify Lexington, but the whole effort

“Any individual witnessing a pos

ed and asking for an explanation of
the incident. If the explanation is
satisfactory, then the matter should
not be brought before the E.C. If
it is unsatisfactory, the has
an obligation to bring it before the

This option of individual
frontation, which has always been im
plicit in the Honor System, is another

con

way of insuring the personal signi-
ficance of the System and, thus,
strengthening it. It must be clear

that this option extends to a student
accuser only, in hopes that some mis-
understanding might be settled by
one who wishes to assume the re-
sponsibility of deciding a question of

honor, rather than give it to the
B.C. The E.C, does not prefer one

option over the other, but feels that
the choice should exist to allow a
student faced with such a question
the opportunity to have it answered
to his greater satisfaction,

Letters to the editor

Student clarifies

attack on newspaper

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

I had thought I had written a let-
ter so clear that even the Phi staff
could understand it, Obviously 1 was
wrong. T will attempt to straighten
out the writers of the replies.

According to the Student Hand-
book, the Publications Board is made
up of all editors and business man-
agers of the publications and all
former editors and business managers
still at Washington and Lee, plus one
faculty member. This year the editor
of the Phi is the president of the

Board, Five of the seven student
members this year belong to Pi
Kappa Phi Fraternity, That is fact.

My proposal for a revised Publica-
tions Board does merit comment be-
cause it is the only way the W&L
student body wil get a deeent news-
paper.

Mr. Coleman has obviously not
read my letter, I quite clearly state
how the Phi can be improved. I put
in 60 hours a week participating in
different campus activities, which
is why IT haven't been to any of the
Phi meetings. How much time does
Mr. Coleman put in at the Phi?
Obviously very litth, for he de-
himself as being only an
“occasional” contributor, In the more
than two years that I have been
here | have seen the Phi deteriorate
from a decent paper to what it now
is. Mr. Coleman has been here not
quite four weeks. Perhaps he should
refrain from speaking on subjects
about which he has lithe knowledge.

Perhaps yould should refrain from
speaking on subjects about which
you have little knowledge, Mr.
Meschutt. As quite clearly stated in
last week's Ring-tum Phi, there are
men sitting on the Publications
Board who are not listed in the
Student Handbook; these persons
serve on the Board ex ollicio, and
hold full voting rights. It is true
that five members of the same fra-
ternity sit on the Board this
but have you troubled yourself
find out how many of these
for their positions unopposed, when
no one else even bothered to run?
Ind although Mr. Coleman has only
been here for four weeks, by virtue
of the work he has put in on the
newspaper he has more knowledge
of it than yourself.

Generals fall short
of homecoming hopes

hy ONIL COTE
Sports Stalf

Playing the role of the spoilers, the
Lynx from Southwestern University
took advantage of some typical Wash-
ington and Lee schizophrenia and
went on to disappoint some 4,000
Homecoming fans by overtaking the
Generals, 27-14, ‘The loss dippe:t
Wk&L's record to 0-3-1.

“Tm very disappointed over oul
inconsistency,” moaned a sullen
Coach McHenry as he replayed
crucial moments of the game in his
mind. “We had three good oportuni-
ties to score but each time we failed
to capitalize, We came back in the
second half with some good offense
and defense but we simply couldn't
put it all together when we really
needed it.’ McHenry went on to
praise the efforts of quarterback Jack
Berry, wide receiver Mark George

and punter Bruce Howard. Although
he didn’t say, it was as obvious as
the grey hairs in his scalp that the
Generals needed a victory to bolster
the esprit. de corps.

The Generals’ overall efficiency dur-
ing the first half was plagued with
mistakes which proved costly in the
final score, the most crucial of which
occured when Berry coughed up the
pigskin in Lynx territory after being
blindsided by a Southwestern line-
man. Berry, as brilliant in defeat as
the Lynx’s Soloman was in victory,
came back just minutes later with
another threat but a heavy rush by
Southwestern rattled the field) gen-
eral and forced him to throw a drive-
killing interception, Both the Gen-
erals and the Lynx used their highly
touted defenses to held cach other
scoreless after the first period,

Southwestern finally broke — the

ond quarter by virtue of quarter-

Soccer Generals
trounce Radford

By SANDY BISHOP

Producing their best soccer match
to date, the Generals of W&L came
up with their first victory of the
season, as well as dropping a hard
fought contest to a tough Lynchburg
squad.

Using crisp passing and more plays
to the wings, W&L mustered a 5-0
win over Radford, In their best per-
formance offensively, the Generals
cominually peppered Radford’s goal
and allowed few balls to enter their
defensive half of the field.

Mike Monahan scored the initial
goal after a hustling collision with
the Radford goalie. Woods King
made it 2-0 on a nice header off a
Bill Stone cross. The Generals’ third
goal came early in the second half
off the foot of Bill Cogar. The final
woals were scored by freshman Todd
Tyson. Mark Bennett had to make
very few close saves in the shutout.

Saturday W&L faced Lynchburg’s
Hornets before a large Homecoming
crowd, Lynehburg's offense was led
by All-American Bob Coote, but
WEkL was able to keep him some-
what in check, W&L played a very
fine first half, getting some good
shots off and only allowing one mix-
up which Coote converted into a
1-0 halftime lead.

Exhaustion and the heat were fac-
tors in the second half, as Lynech-

burg blasted away at goalie Mark
Bennett, but the Hornets were con-
tinually stopped, W&L could muster
little offense as Coote came up with
his second goal and then a penatly
shot was made after Coote was
tripped, W&L played tough through-
out the match, and as the young
squad continues to play it will con
tinue to improve and convert close
matches to its favor. The Generals
go after their second win this week
against V.M.I.

Harriers Win

Tem Washington led the Generals
to a much deserved victory in cross
country competition by finishing with
a solid 27:58 time in the five mile
run to lift W&L over both Lyneh-
burg College and Virginia Wesleyan
last Saturday. The victory, which
upped the Generals’ slate to 7-2,
went largely unnoticed due to the
Homecoming football game against
Southwestern later that afternoon,
Despite the lack of publicity, Coach
Miller was pleased with the way
things went and hopes the good
fortune will continue.

The Generals overcame Lynchburg
24-31 and easily outran Virginia
Wesleyan. Paul Thompson, jim

_ Frantz, Al Weeks and Mike Burns all

earned respectable finishes in addi-
tion to Washington.

back John Loebel’s three yard run.
McConkey made good on the extra
point attempt to give the Lynx a
7-4 lead, W&L avenged the score
several minutes later by putting
Loebel out of service with shoulder
injury. Loebel’s back-up, Craig
Soloman, made his presence known
and regretted by the Generals when
he pitched a five yard touchdown
pass to Rick Talley to make it 13-0.
Late in the first half Berry engaged
in a desperate race against the clock
in a futile effort to put the Gen-
crals on the scoreboard. Berry and
his comrades ripped and snorted their
way to the Cat's 4 yard line before
time ran out sending W&L into the
locker room against a 13 point deficit.

‘The outlook wasn't encouraging
when the Generals took the field in
the third quarter, W&L found itself
under the shadows of its own goal
post on its own ten yard line. Berry,
teamed with the likes of his two
deep threats, Mike George and ‘Tony
Berry, were more than equal to the
task, however, as the three waged
their own private war against the
Lynx's secondary. Berry hit on three
passes to bring the Generals to the
Southwestern 9 yard line, Eamon Cas-
sell then carried the ball into the
end zone for the long over-due score.
‘Thompson's extra point attempt split
the uprights to reduce the Lynx’s
lead to 18-7, One minute later WKL’'s
Charlie Brown picked off an errant
Soloman pass at Southwestern’s 35
yard line, From there Cassell carried
for five yards and then Berry arched
a 30 yard aerial strike which Mark
George hauled in to even the score.
‘Thompson then gave the Generals
lead on the extra point,

The Generals had their fun in the
third quarter but Southwestern
under Soloman’s leadership re-took
the lead early in the final period.
Phe Lynx played a ball control game
the rest of the way and Seloman
picked the W&L defense apart like
a surgeon. He tossed a 9 yard scor-
ing pass which climaxed a ten play
drive to put the Lynx out in front
21-14, Soloman'’s teammate, defensive
buck Jon Mischke (who had previ-
ously been beat by W&L’'s receivers),
applied the coup de grace to the
Generals by intercepting a Berry
pass and returning it to the W&L 25
vard line. Irish McConkey kicked a
23 yard field goal two minutes later
to all but put the game out of reach.
Berry, refusing to give up, came out
passing again but the ubiquitous
Mischke stole yet another pass and
the vexing McConkey booted yet
another field goal to make the final
score 27-14,
