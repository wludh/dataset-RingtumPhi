Four persons presented peti-
tions to the Executive Committee
Monday night for the position of
Vice-President of the sophomore
class.

Gordon reveals
production idea
for ‘Peer Gynt’

By GRAY COLEMAN

Dr. Albert Gordon, Fine Arts
Caairman and drama_ professor,
recently announced the final plans
for the six-week Spring Theatre
Program, The featured presenta-
(ion will be Henrik Ibsen’s Peer
Gynt, a romantic-fantasy-epic.

“This will be a totall) new
concept in drama for the W&L
heatre,” Gordon commented. “It
will be completely staged and
produced outdoors, in a natural
theatre setting—the ruins of an
old lime kiln just a bit out of
town on Lime Kiln Road. This
ea has been used once before

a theatre stage, during the
vell-remembered Lexington civic
production of Shakespeare’s A
Midsummer Night's Dream in
1967. Not only were a large num
ber of townspeople involved then
but passing airplanes were re
routed to avoid noisy interfer-
ence during the show.”

The play will be entirely staged
and produced by the Total Theatre
tudents of Drama 139. Perform
ance dates are May 26, 27, and 28
and anyone interested about work

wasting your time putting them
on the freshman or law dorms.”

In other business, Scott Frank-
lin suggested that E.C. members
and others using the Student
Center begin swearing out war-
rants on local youngsters who are
causing problems in the Center
at night.

sill Webster suggested that the
problem could be handled by a
student “police committee,” a
group students

of who would

patrol the halls of the Student
Center at night and eject un-
wanted visitors.

Webster’s suggested committee
would also help with control of
traffic problems at the Mock Con
vention parade this Spring and
would act year-round as a go-be-
tween to help with communica-
tions problems between W&L stu-
dents and Lexington Police.

Law school ready

The structure of Washington
and Lee’s new law building, Lewis
Hall, has been essentially com-
pleted, and work now concen-
trates principally on finishing the
interior and landscaping. W&L
expects to begin moving into the
121,000-square-foot, $7-million
facility this spring, and it will be
ready for classes in September.

Construction of the building is
supported by the $9-million gift
in 1972 from Frances and Sydney
Lewis of Richmond, for whom it
is named. Mr. Lewis, a W&L
graduate and trustee, is president
and board chairman of Best
Products Ine., the catalogue-show-
room retail chain; Mrs. Lewis is
executive vice president of Best.

The building, located just to
the west of the long-developed
Front Campus area, will also
contain some of the nation’s most
sophiticated facilities for law
study and legal research.

Every student will have his or
her own office-type study area,
connected electronically to a cen-
tral audio-visual “media control
room” and closed-circuit produc-
tion studio, Lewis Hall will also

REVIEWandOUTLOOK Criticism and Comment

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Thursday, January 29, 1976

Are closed faculty
meetings necessary?

Recently we were admonished by a member of the faculty
for alleged inaccuracies in our editorial column on January 8
dealing with the abolishment of the Washington Holiday.
We were told that our observations were superficial and seem-
ed to indicate a basic ignorance of what really occurred at
the December faculty meeting.

We could argue that the
faculty meetings may be incomplete or even unintentionally
misleading on occasion—of necessity we receive our facts
through second-hand accounts of the proceedings. No students
are allowed to sit in on faculty meetings.

Faculty meetings are among the most important gather-
ings that occur on this campus, and each meeting produces
something that will affect some student in some way. It is
the obligation of the student media to report on these gather-
ings, in which students may have such a vital interest. But if

information we receive on

the meetings are to be reported on factually and responsibly,
an arrangement better than the current one needs to be made.
Why must we gain our knowledge of actions taken by the
faculty through secondary sources? Why cannot faculty
meetings be open to the public?

We realize that there are times and there are issues that
should not be acted upon while under the scrutiny of student
observers. In matters such as when specific students are
discussed, the faculty could go into closed session, in a manner
similar to that used by the student Executive Committee.

The point might be raised that students would observe
how various professors vote on specific matters. Fine. If
faculty members are really concerned about how students
think of them (which is doubtful in many cases), then they
will vote on delicate issues with more care and judgment.

It might be pointed out that the coverage given by student
media to open faculty meetings would be biased. Perhaps.
But then again, the coverage given at present is biased, toward
the faculty's point of view. We are only allowed to know
what that body chooses to release through its spokesman.

Perhaps we should not raise this issue. Perhaps we should
be content with the way things are set up at present. But
somehow we get the feeling that students should have the
right to know what the faculty-—-whose decisions in academic
and other matters affect us all—is doing in those mysterious
meetings on the first Monday of each month.

A tale of the Tux

The Student Activities Board has announced its plans for
Fancy Dress ‘76, as reported in last week's Ring-tum Phi. This
year’s gala ball will attempt to recreate the mood of the Holly-
wood of a bygone era, when the Gables and Harlows and
Bogarts reigned supreme at the State and the Lyric.

Last year’s Fancy Dress was a grand success, with 1,000
couples in attendance, yet the S.\.B. made a series of con-
cessions which disturbed us at the time. Initially Faney
Dress '75 was to have been a Black Tie affair; under limited
student pressure, the board downgraded the formal dance from
Black Tie to Suit Required. Still finding itself facing opposi-
tion, the board denigrated the event further, to Coat and
Tie status.

We hope that the current Student Activities Board ex-
hibits more backbone than its predecessor if it is confronted
by those students who prefer a minimal dress requirement,
Last year more than 90% of those who attended were in
formal attire (through no small effort on the part of our local
clothiers, who cut the rental fees on their tuxedos greatly ).

The S.A.B. plans a variety of activities which appeal to
different segments of the student body, from events for lovers
of rhythm and blues to shows for vulgarity aficionados. Faney
Dress is geared toward those of us who enjoy stepping out
in grand style on rare occasions, and who appreciate secing
our female companions in something other than blue jeans
and peasant blouses,

lhe past two years have seen Faney Dress slowly pull it-
self from the pit into whieh it had fallen, and begin the slow
ascent back into the limelight as the collegiate social event of
the Valley. Let's not compromise the spirit of the weekend,
but let's keep the dress truly fancy.

Sophomore class told
of threatened legal suit
by Homecoming band

To The Sophomore Class:

As of now, it is very possible
that the Sophomore Class may be
sued by “The Devil’s Workshop,”
the band we employed during
Homecoming. It is also possible
that I will be sued personally. It
is legally difficult to sue a ‘‘sopho-
more class” and my signature is
on the contract. Their total is
$1400 which they claim will pay
for damaged equipment and cars.
An extra $400 is being charged
to us by “Devil’s Workshop” for
rented equipment. The only dam-
age I saw was a speaker with a
ripped screen. The band managed
to play our entire engagement
and at a fraternity party later
that night.

The band leader started calling
me at six o’clock and seven o’clock
in the morning, starting in late
October, demanding his money.
I went to Dean Noell and he
thought it would be wise to get
a lawyer. On this advice, I then
went to Leland McCullough who
directed me to Thomas Spencer,
the lawyer for the Executive Com-
mittee. He has since been in touch
with the band leader several
times. He says that if they sue,
our chances would be about fifty-
fifty. My lawyer in Atlanta says
I should expect to be sued myself.

Also this term Dave Bauman
did not return to W&L. This
leaves us without a Vice-President
at a time when we need one most.
I requested the E.C. to appoint
a Vice-President until the next
election in March. I thought the
logical temporary choice would
be David Low. Running for the
University Council he received
the most votes in a field of five.
He is also familiar with the case
and has met the lawyer.

The E.C. decided to have an
election which has left the class
without a Vice-President for an
extra two weeks. I was trying to
act in the best interest of the
class as quickly as I could.

The Sophomore Class Treasury
now stands at $1,300.00. We have
paid for everything we need to
this year, and this remaining
money can be spent on anything
we want, should we not be sued.
This would easily pay for two
or three parties in the spring such
as the ones we had last year, still

in the Treasury for our Junior
year. We have now started paying
Mr. Spencer, our lawer. He has
asked for a $100.00 retainer which
is normal in any type of case. We
have also incurred an additional
$25.00 legal bill for Mr. Spencer’s
communications with the band and
his legal research on the case.
As the case develops I will keep
you informed through the Ring-
tum Phi.

The election for the Vice-Presi-
dent will be held on Monday.
Please vote for the man you
think most qualified for the job
at this time.

Rodney Cook
President of the
Sophomore Class

J.G.F.’s editorial cited
as “obtuse,” “abysmal

failure” by E.C. rep.
Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

W&L has indeed come to a
pitiable state of affairs when a
reporter is so obtuse that he can-
not differentiate between a humor-
ous remark and a serious state-
ment. Let me try to educate
J.G.F. about the difference:

1) I did not mean to imply that
some Student Control Committee
members are buffoons. I voted for
and supported all of the seniors.
I count (counted?) the other mem-
bers as close personal friends. I
would have made the same re-
mark in just about any other
organization (including the E.C.)
if there was no possibility of my
being taken seriously. This quali-
fication obviously does not in-
clude the Phi.

2) 1 like sophomores. Many of
them are (were?) my good friends.
There were also several factual
inaccuracies and misleading sate-
ments, a common occurence in
J.F.F.’s articles as well as edi-
torials.

1) I did not move that the E.C.
“do nothing.” I suggested that we
wait until the March class elec-
tion, and appoint the victor of
that contest as interim Vice Presi-
dent.

2) Scott Franklin contended that
the E.C. should not appoint a
student to fill an elected position
when more than half the year
remained. This is obviously not
the same thing as choosing a stu-
dent for an appointed position.
The sophomore class certainly de-
serves to choose their Vice Presi-

leaving several hundred dollars dent.

Lemmings managed to insult
nearly everyone at show

By RYLAND OWEN

“Is nothing sacred?” Doubtless,
at some time during the evening
last Friday, this question was
posed by nearly everyone in at-
tendance at The National Lam-
poon Show. The answer was an
unmistakably obscene “no.” The
six-member cast performed a vari-
ety of skits, songs, and uniquely
choreographed numbers, with
sometimes a dash, and more often
an overdose, of vulgarity and
profanity.

Audience reaction to the skits
was usually mixed. Those familiar
with National Lampoon Magazine
were surely braced for the bom-
bardment of explicit language
and gesticulations hurled at the
audience for almost two hours.
Yet a significant number of specta-
tors obviously underestimated the
Lampoon's passion for the offen-
sive; these people, some more
tolerant than others, made up the
small stream of disgusted onlook-
ers who left the performance after
particularly scurrilous skits.

But the performers were con-
fident, almost arrogant, in the
way they rattled off extremely
vulgar lines without the slight-
est hesitation. Frequently, the
audience was barely able to react
to one nasty punchline before be-
ing subjected to another merci-
less parody.

Among the more distasteful ma-
terial was a reference to the
infirmities of Karen Ann Quinlan
and Betty Ford, as well as a highly
sacrilegious crucifixion scene

There were also several
sketches which, in addition to
being terribly obscene, were

monotonous and uninteresting. A
rather disguesting discussion of
female anatomy among a group
of housewives dragged on and on,
quickly reaching the point of
ludicrousness.

Still, the evening had its high
points. A musical number en-
titled “Prison Farm” was an ex-
cellent satire on the comfortable
life of the Watergate conspira-
tors. A superficial interpretation
of Dostoevskis The tdiot also

earned a few good chuckles. Sur-
prisingly, a splendid take-off on
the typical Jewish night club
comedian did not get a favorable
response from the audience, even

though it was tastefully done.
This stand-up comic routine and
a cynical appeal to all plant
lovers were probably the best
skits of the show.

3) Although he began his
column by excoriating us for al-
legedly not reading the Student
Body Constitution, J.G.F. never
deigned to enlighten us about the
correct interpretation. Actually,
the wording does not mandate
election or appointment.

In general, the editorial was
replete with glib generalities,
while missing the most important
point of the whole affair. J.G.F.
apparently could not comprehend
the absurdity of the Sophomore
President’s request. Cook wanted
the E.C. to appoint one of his
friends as Vice President without
the formality of any hearings,
interviews, or other selection pro-
cedures. The sophomore class and
the Phi could indeed be dis-
mayed had the E.C. chosen so
dictatorial a course. Instead, we
concentrated on deciding the tim-
ing of a new election. The dis-
cussion at times waxed humorous
because several of us prefer a
healthy cynicism and a little
humor to the pomposity and
ridiculous formality which often
pervades student government
organizations.

As an incisive and perceptive
editorial worthy of the attention
of its readers, J.G.F.’s effort was
an abysmal failure. As an example
of worthless reporting, quoting
out of context, and attempted
character assassination, the edi-
torial is a masterpiece worthy of
inclusion in a journalism text-
book.

Robert Pugh
Class of 1976

Healthy cynicism and a little
humor is indeed preferable
to pomposity and ridiculous
formality. Cynicism to the point
of absurdity and humor which
insults others is not.

Article condones crime
in secretary’s opinion;
dislike of “‘alternative

reporting style’’ aired
Jan. 22, 1976
To the Editor and Bob Chiaviello:
This week there is an article
in the Ring-tum Phi about student
vandals who caused $500.00 dam-
age to a fellow student’s car. Your
newspaper treats this incident as
if it were a humorous human in-
terest story. It isn’t funny that
students are vandals—no one is
amused. In fact, I am disgusted
that vou would report the incident
and then brush it off by saying
that the victim involved is “not
very popular as it is.” (That is
really adding insult to injury
and is not newsworthy.) You
must not condone these illegal
actions—yet the Ringtum Phi
repeatedly makes light of stu-
dents who are caught stealing
from Mother's Restaurant or who
are drunk and damage vroperty.
Bob Chiaviello says in a letter
to the Editor this week that
former contributors to the
Thymes will now take part in the
more established campus publica-

tions—‘“hopefully in that way the
University can benefit from some
new ideas.” Thanks, Bob, but re-
porting acts of vandalism and
then pinning them on the victim
because of his personality is a
bad “idea.”

I notice you always run quota-
tions from the WHITE BOOK on
page two. What good does it do?
The Honor Code is a joke as long
as you make light of the serious
crimes that students commit.

Why don’t you ever name the
victims and offenders in these
cases? After all you are a news-
paper! You should report the
nows in full—rather than _hint-
ing at it—like a gossip column.

Jan Shivel

Names were omitted in the
article, not because we prefer
to report news like gossip
items, but because the incident
is under investigation by the
Executive Committee in regard
to a possible Honor Violation.
The uncomplimentary reference
to the student whose car was
damaged exhibited a poor lack
of judgment on our part, and
we apologize for it. In any case,
we do not condone vandalism
or theft, as you insinuate.

Inter-Varsity explained
Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

As a new organization on
campus, Inter-Varsity faces the
same misconceptions of its pur-
pose and activities that any new
campus organization confronts.
One of the two most frequent
misconceptions about Inter-Var-
sity stems from the name itself.
Inter-Varsity Christian Fellow-
ship is a national organization
that had its origin at Cambridge
University, England, about a cen-
tury ago. Inter-Varsity is the
British term meaning “between
Universities” —as the Cambridge
movement soon spread to other
campuses—although the name to-
day is usually tied to athletics.
The other most common mis-
conception is that the campus
Inter-Varsity chapter is a club
open to members only. However,
anyone who is interested in at-
tending chapter meetings is in-
vited and welcome to come.

The purpose of 1-V is to pro-
vide a meeting time on campus
for Christians. There is singing
accompanied by acoustical guitar
in addition to frequent speakers
and small group discussion which
attemp! to help a student better
understand his faith and to relate
his commitment to his personal
circumstances and to contempor-
ary society in general. In fulfilling
these functions. an |-V chapter
secks to keep the Christian posi
tion open on campus as a live
option from which to choose.

For further information about
Inter-Varsity or its activilies, con-
tact me or look for weekly an-
nouncements posted around
campus.

Tav Lupton °76

Washington and Lee’s basketball
Generals won two games last
week, improving their record to
10-3 and giving them sole pos-
session of first place in VCAA
competition.

But the two victories did not
come easy for W&L as one game
went into double overtime and
both games were won by only
one point.

In a game played last Wednes
day against Eastern Mennonite
College, the Generals battled
against a team that had won only
one game this year and won
in the second overtime period,
70-69. And even then the victory
came with no time showing on
the clock as Bob Flint hit a free
throw to give W&L the win.

Head coach Verne Canfield said
the Generals played poorly and
gave credit to the opponents for
a fine effort.

The W&L wrestling team had a
chance to knock off the Keydets

of V.M.L for the first time in
years at a meet last Wednesda)
night in the V.M.I. Fieldhouse

rhey looked like they were going
to do it until the Keydets swept
the last four weight classes, show-
ing that they were not to be out
don by their civilian neighbors.
The final score was 28-18, but the
Generals were ahead at one point
during the event by a score of
18-16. W&L’s only pin of the meet
was accomplished by Kevin Mec
Fadden, who pinned his man
ith 1:48 left in the first period.

Jimmy Crytzer scored a decisive
decision over his opponent by a
score of 12-

The Generals bounced back last
Saturday for a very strong show
ne in the Citadel Invitational
Tournament, finishing up in third
place in a very impressive six
team field. Coach Gary Franke’s
wrestlers were just edged for the
runner-up spot by hosting team
Citadel. Pembrok won the over
all title with 85 3/4 points, fol

lowed by the Citadel with 66!

Saturday in Doremus Gym W&L
took on the Tigers of Hampden-
Sydney, who were 9-3 going into
the game. The Tigers had two of
the VCAA’s leading scorers in
Dick Ponti and Ed Tiernan. Ponti
hurt the Generals with 26 points
but Tiernan only got five points
and fouled out of the game with
three minutes left.

W&L led most of the first half
as Hampden-Sydney missed shots
and turned the ball over several
times. The Generals hit 8 points
in a row early in the half to take
a 11-4 lead. Ponti brought the
Tigers back, however, and the
W&L margin fell to a point with
9:38 remaining. Pat Dennis came
off the bench to get the Generals’
offense moving by scoring 8 points
in a little more than _ three
minutes. This did not stop the
Tigers as they tied it at 32-32
with 4:30 left in the half. Chris
Larson, John Podgajny and Flint

ace third

W&L with 6344, Davidson 53',
Clemson 1115, and College ol
Charleston 11'4.

W&L had six wrestlers reach
the finals but none of them were

able to take first. The Generals
did manage to take two third

place spots and one fourth place.
Reaching the finals for W&L were
Tom Morville at 118, Graham
Hudgins at 142, McFadden at 150,
Crytzer at 158, Bill Cole at 177
and heavyweight Dan _ Kniffen.

individual championship as he

to give W&L a 40-34 lead at
intermission.
Podgajny led both teams in

scoring in the first half with 12
points while Don Berlin led in
rebounds with 5. Both teams shot
poorly from the field at 45 per
cent. W&L did better in free
throws, however, hitiing 6-8 to
Ilampden-Sydney’s 8-14.

The start of the second half
saw a determined Hampden-Syd-
ney team come back to tie the
Generals at 41-41. Ponti and Tom-
my Jackson were hard to stop
underneath and the Tigers took
a 46-44 lead with 14 minutes left
to play.

The Generals’ hopes were weak-
ened with 12:39 left as their
tall center, Don Berlin, committed
his fourth foul. Jeff Baum and
Norm Kristoff, who made his first
appearance since injuring his
shoulder in early January, filled

Bill Cole upset the tournament’s

in the vacancy to keep W&L even
under the boards.

Hampden-Sydney took a_ six-
point lead 58-53, after an easy
Marty McNerney layup with eight
minutes showing on the clock.
With that, Coach Canfield called
timeout and reorganized the team
with a few inspirational words.

And his strategy payed off as
the Generals came back with two
baskets by Flint and one by Kim
Sims to take a 59-58 lead. The
Tigers did not give up, however,
and the lead bounced back and
forth. Chris Larson hit a free
throw to tie the game at 63 all
with 3:33 remaining.

A lot happened in the last three
minutes but W&L led 70-69 with
33 seconds left. A Hampden-Syd-
ney player fouled Larson with
18 seconds remaining to send him
to the foul line. Larson converted
both attempts to give the Gen
erals a three-point lead and Hamp-
den-Sydney called timeout.

Things looked good for W&L
with only 12 seconds left on the

clock and a 72-69 lead. The Tigers
threw the ball in hoping to con
truct a three-point play. Only
half of their wish came true as
Ponti connected underneath for
a basket right at the buzzer but
was not fouled. The Generals won
72-71.

Three Generals, Podgajny, Lar
son and Flint, ended up scoring
double figures as W&L won its
eighth game in a row. Ponti led
both teams in scoring with 26
points. The Generals finished the
game shooting a poor 41 per cent
from the field. Hampden-Sydney
helped by missing 12 free throws
in 29 attempts.

changes reflect conciliatory mood between factions

are to be allocated to the candi-
dates and uncommitted groups in
proportion to the vote each re-
ceived (provided that is at least
15% of the vote).

What these changes seem to
indicate is more segmentation of
the vote, and, in a year when a
dozen are campaigning, it would
seem that everybody will get a
little piece of the cake. A ma-
jority will be hard to form on
the first ballot. Also, because the
candidates may hand pick their
delegates, those ‘smoke-filled’

rooms will be hard pre‘sed to

form a workable compromise.
But the rules changes represent
a lot more than procedure to the
Democratic Party—they are a
compromise between the McGov-
ern forces and the party’s regul-
ars. Each group has manhandled
one of the last two conventions;
the regulars in ’68 and the Mc-
Govern forces in ’72. In 1976,
neither faction can win the gen-
eral election in November with-
out the support of the other, so
it is about time for each to learn

The liberals were able to ‘bring
it home’ with smaller voting dis-
tricts or units, while the door
was reopened to the established
party people with 25% of the
delegates elected by the state
party committee. The 1976 Demo-
cratic Convention will still house
a large percentage of novice
delegates, but returning from a
four-year absence will be the
party’s established. The nominec
will have to identify with both
of these wings.

SAB chairmen Atwood
and Thompson report

on NatLamp revenues
(Continued from page 1)

Thompson, co-chairmen of the Stu-
dent Activities Board, reported
that the National Lampoon show
last Friday night brought in $1150
for the SAB. The board had been
expecting about $500.

Atwood also reported that the
SAB has purchased a new piano.
The piano cost the SAB $225, part
of which was paid by Student
Center director Mike Cappeto’s
funds.

Also Jay duRivage, chairman of
the Cold Check Committee, re-
ported that his committee has
$150 in the bank and is owed $190
in outstanding accounts,

DuRivage also questioned the
E.C. about the possibility of issu-
ing ID ecards which are color-cod-
ed by year. This would help Lex-
ington merchants in identifying
current W&L students, according
to duRivage.

McCullough told duRivage he
might talk to Colonel Harold
Head, the University registrar,
about the possibility of the idea.
