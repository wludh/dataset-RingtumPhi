the end is near

Admissions up— considerably!

Preliminary statistics indicate
that the freshman class entering
in the fall will be largest in
W&L history.

According to James Farrar,
Director of Admissions, 421 stu-
dents are currently enrolled for
the fall semester, an increase of
42 over 1975. (This figure does not
take into account those men who
may cancel during the summer.)

Applications were off 99 this
year, down to 1300 from 1399
in 1975. Numbers of students ap-
plying had been increasing since
1968 until last year.

Sixty-one per cent Accepted

W&L accepted 791 applicants
this year, or 61% of those who
filed applications. Last year the
figures were 819 and 58%, re-
spectively. And this year to date
there have been 421 confirmations,
from 379 the previous year.

43 of those entering in the fall
were admitted under W&L’s Early
Decision Plan. Five students are
from Rockbridge County, leaving
the University the dilemma of
where to house the remaining 400
or so who will show in Sept.

No definite housing arrange-
ments have been made yet. Ac-
cording to Farrar, specific plans
for handling the overflow will not
be made until it is seen just how
many applicants will withdraw
their confirmations in the next
four weeks.

Lustre, depth lacking

By RICHARD S. WOLF

The University Theatre ended
its season this week with an out-
door staging of Henrik Ibsen's

poetic epic Peer Gynt. The pas-
toral setting of the old lime kiln
was enchanting and did much to
enhance this nineteenth century

Norwegian classic. Unfortunately,
the production did not live up to
its backdrop.

There are certain’ inherent
problems in Peer Gynt that must
be overcome before the play can
be successfully staged. Its prolix
nature demands a plethora of

dated in Davis and also in Lee
I and Il. But that still will leave
a good number of men “home-
less.” Suggestions range from ex-
cess fraternity space to a few
floors of the Robert E. Lee Hotel.

Farrar, while surprised at the
response this eyar, is nonetheless
pleased at the results of this
year’s admissions efforts. The
yield (the number of confirma-
tions over the number of those
accepted) is 53%, the highest
ever except for 1965, when the
ratio was 54%. Preliminary
figures also suggest that this will
be one of the most highly quali-
fied classes in recent W&L his-
tory.

Although the Admissions staff
will not know for sure until the
results of the freshman survey
are compiled after Orientation, it
appears that this year’s acceptance
rate indicates a higher percentage
of applicants who filed at only
two or three colleges rather than
applying at half-a-dozen schools.

Number 29

 

Management team for W&L dining service will remain the same when the University brings it under its
wing this summer: from left, Rodney Rogers, baker; Charles Dunn, chef; and Jerry Darrell, manager.

WeéL assumes Evans control

W&L will bring its dining-hall
service under its own manage-
ment at the end of the current
academic year and has named
Gerald J. Darrell permanent man-
ager of the operation.

Until now, the university, like
many other colleges and similar
institutions, has contracted with
ARA-Slater Services Inc. to pro-
vide food service to resident stu-
dents and for university functions.

Darrell has been Slater’s resi-
dent manager at Washington and
Lee since 1970.

University officials said the
move is being made to assure

the greatest possible economy and
efficiency, while maintaining a
superior level of meal service.
The university credits Darrell
with keeping costs low and qual-
ity high as well as with building
an extraordinary rapport with stu-
dents. In four years, the cost of
the 21-meals-a-week plan at W&L
has risen only $150, from $600 to
$800 next year, despite a dra-
matic rise in the cost of food
and the cost of preparing it, a
university spokesman said.
Darrell said he plans no per-
sonnel changes in the dining hall
when he brings it under W&L

Curriculum committee reviewed

By J. MICHAEL GALLAGHER

The Curriculum Committee here
at W&L has in the past performed
the function of conducting a sur-
vey of courses to inform the stu-
dent body, professors, and in-
coming freshmen how different
courses and different professors
rate in the eyes of the students.
This survey should not be in-

in play,
an asset

scene changes as well as a
shortening of Ibsen's original
script. Technically, Mr. Roman-

chuck and his students did an
admirable job with the numerous
rearrangements of the set. The
only exception to this was the
attempt to portray the sinking of
Peer’s yacht at the beginning of
Act Il; it would have been better
were it left out than to be treated
so amateurishly.

Another difficulty in doing this
play is that while it is meant to
be a spectacle, the psychological
subtleties must not be forfeited
for grandiosity. Bill Hirschmann,
in the title role, offered a super-
ficial portrayal of a very complex
character. An honest interpreta
tion of Peer demands the dis-
play of a wide range of emotions
Mr. Hirschmann tended to remain
at an emotional high. He did not
investigate the multi-faceted per-
sonality that makes Peer Gynt
the archetypal figure that he is.
Technically, however, the actor
did a fine job with an extremely
difficult role.

The translation and adaption
chosen for the production varies
from the original in many ways
The most important difference is
in the role of the Button Molde:
Mr. Jurgensen’s adaption greatly
expands this part, making it sec-
ondary only to Peers in im
portance, And while Taylor Harbi
son gave a consistant perform-
ance, one had the impression that
much more could have been done
with this role

The criticism of
ance would again have to be
that the spectacular aspects of
the character were blown out of
proportion. Consequently, the
complexities of the Button Mold

terpreted as a vendetta against
the faculty, but rather as a means
of conveying to the faculty and
administration student ideas
about the curriculum.

Data used to be collected three
times a year until professors’
complaints about the survey dis-
rupting their class schedules
reduced it to twice a year, and
this year to only once. After the
compilation of the data, copies
are distributed to the individual
professors; the heads of the dif-
ferent departments; the deans of
the school and two copies (for
student use) to the library.

How is the survey regarded’
During registration, the survey is
in great demand by the students.
But it is debatable whether or
not the faculty pays any attention
to it. It seems as though the
faculty is divided on the question
of the student survey. Some fac-
ulty think it is a useful device
that will help them improve their
course and possibly their methods
of teaching. Some even go so far
as to make suggestions for ques-
tions that could possibly be added
to the survey.

Then there are those on the
other side of the fence, who be-
lieve that the students aren't
qualified to rate their professors

‘In a mental institution, the
patients don’t rate their doctors.”
It is also thought that the survey
only sets a disharmonic atmos-
phere among the faculty. It has
a tendency to injure the feelings
of some, and ruffle the feathers of
others.

Other faculty believe that the
survey is only a popularity con-
test and doesn’t actually give a
true evaluation of teachers and
courses; therefore, it doesn't serve

a useful purpose. One outspoken
faculty member remarked, “At
the University of Michigan or any
other Behemoth University, such
an evaluation could serve a use-
ful purpose when there are thous-
ands of faculty members; but
W&L is about as small as three
telephone booths. The ‘grapevine’
would do the job.” These faculty
believe that the dorm counselors
and upperclassmen should pass
the word about courses instead of
a formal survey doing the job.

Washington Hall seems to sup-
port the committee in its under-
takings. Dean Watt says the com-
mittee is doing a fine job, but he
would ask a couple of different
questions and remove some exist-
ing questions from the survey.
Though he believes that the sur-
vey is accurate in its findings
about courses and teachers, he
never makes any recommenda-
tions when studying salaries for
the upcoming year.

While the survey is the most
important function of the six man
committee, it isn’t the only one.
Besides directly reporting to the
E.C., it has two members who
sit on the faculty Committee of
Courses and Degrees. They make
recommendations about the cur:
riculum to the committee, and
receive suggestions about the
survey in return,

Next year’s committee, co-
chaired by Carl Baker and
Tom McCarthy, plans to rid itself
of the do-nothing label it has
acquired during the past years
and adopt a work-horse attitude
for next year. There are going to
be two surveys next year, one in
the fall and one in the winter

management. He said his two key
employees under Slater’s manage-
ment of the dining service will
remain in their posts with the
new arrangement—chef Charles
Dunn, who came to W&L five
years ago after a decade at Roa-
noke College, and baker Rodney
Rogers, a 13-year veteran at W&L
under the Slater system.

Darrell said he also plans a
staff reorganization which will in-
volve promotions from within the
existing staff and which will also
create additional student jobs.

Currently, the dining hall under
Slater management has a full-
time staff of 15 and six part-time
employees, as well as 35 students
who earn part of their college
costs by working in the dining
hall.

This year there are 470 students
who eat their meals regularly in
the dining hall. The service also
has a considerable amount of ban-
quet, catering and other special-
event business for university-re-
lated events from meetings of the
Board of Trustees to student
groups. In recent years the din-
ing-hall service has also become
much sought-after for dinners
sponsored by civic and other local
organizations which involve mem-
bers of the W&L community,
ranging from the Rockbridge
Historical Society to area garden
clubs and the Chamber of Com-
merce.

Frequently Darrell plans special
events for his student patrons,
from outdoor barbecues to
“theme” dinners and elaborate
spreads to mark holidays.

WDBJ documentary
on Mock Convention
to be broadcast here

The 1976 Mock Democratic Con.
vention will be the topic of a
half-hour television documentary
to be re-broadeast on Cable Nine
the W&L-operated local television
station, this Friday.

The program—-produced and
originally broadcast last weeken¢
by WDBJ-TV, Channel 7, Roanoke
— Will be broadcast on the cable
station at 7 p.m., just before the
evening news.

Tom Mattesky and Paul Lan
caster are the writers and re
porters of the program. Both are
W&L graduates who are now
members of the Channel 7 news
staff. In addition, Mattesky pro
duced the program, as part of
the Roanoke station's “Assign
ment” series of documentaries
and public-affairs programs. The
program’s film editor, Doug Hig.
gins, also has Lexington con
nections. He is the son of Mrs
Douglas S. Higgins of Lexington
and the late Mr. Higgins.

The program is entitled “Wash
ington and Lee’s Mock Conven
tion: Emphasis on Accuracy,’
and is described by WDBJ as “an
in-depth report on what has been
labeled by political observers as
the most accurate and closely
watched collegiate political event
in the country.”

Farewell

For many students the academic year will grind to a halt
on Monday. For seniors, though, the finish is postponed until
next Thursday, when they receive their diplomas from Presi-
dent Huntley, flip their tassels to the left, and step out into
the cold, cruel, “real” world,

Four years of life in Lexington, a life of grueling studies,
of nights spent down the road, of times both good and bad;
four very long and yet exceedingly short years will suddenly
come to an end for you, the Class of 1976, You will be leaving
this sleepy little town without streets and embarking on a
new voyage in your lives, and at a time when conditions are
slowly improving, but still quite difficult economically, socially
and politically.

We feel confident that those of you who are about to leave
here will come to grips with any problems you happen
upon and overcome them handily, Washington and Lee has
hopefully taught you how to cope with more than just term
papers and lab practicals and comprehensive exams. Your
time spent in Lexington has presumably benefited you in a
variety of ways, aiding you in your mental, physical, and
spiritual development. All those mid-terms, Red Square and
Pavilion parties, late-night bull sessions, road trips and tubing
trips, cramming for exams, Truck-Stop runs, and afternoons
at Wilson Field have had their effects on each of you, and
hopefully you are better men for it.

We hope that you graduates-to-be are leaving W&L with
a deep appreciation for the school and for what it has done
for you. We extend our best wishes and hopes for successful
careers, whether they entail further education, a year off for
contemplation, or a foray into the business world, To the
Class of '76 we also say, “Thanks for the contributions you
have made to Washington and Lee during your stay here.”

(none in the spring because of
lack of time and funds). They
plan on improving their public
relations with the faculty, and
reducing the number of com-
plaints they have had in the past
about the haphazard running of
their program. While these actions
will no doubt improve the quality
of the survey, the committee (for
the first time) will also follow up
on the results of the survey and
demand some action. Their im-
mediate target for next year will
be the Math Department.

The average failure rate for the
whole university is 3.4%, while
the Math department’s is 13.8%.
McCarthy attributes this to the
department’s 101 and 102 cal-
culus courses. McCarthy argues
that some incoming freshmen are
not qualified to take calculus
courses, but do so anyway to
fulfill their distribution require-
ments.

Although there are four other
departments offered in Division
Ill, McCarthy says the freshmen
choose math because they are
more familiar with it. As a result,
close to 11% of the freshmen
who take math are “weeded out.”
Therefore, the commitee is going
to push for a pre-calculus course
concentrating on trigonometry to
prepare underqualified students
for the calculus. The course
would count three credits, but
not count towards distribution

The broadcast also explores the

with particular emphasis on 1924,
when the W&L students chose
John W. Davis, correctly—but to
the surprise of observers at the
time—and on 1956, when former
Vice President Alben Barkley,
then a U.S. Senator from Ken-

He likened it to English 100.

Professor Roberts, head of the
Math department, doesn’t believe
a pre-calculus course would help
much, and doesn’t think many
students would take it because it
would be an underlevel course.
He considers the high failure rate
as normal in comparison to other
universities, and gives the reason
as the department’s efforts to
“deliberately change the concep-
tions of intended math majors
about math.”

He believes that many of the
incoming freshmen take math for
one of two reasns: a.) they really
want arithmetic, b.) they like
science and liken math to science.
Math, he says, is not a science by
the conventional understanding of
science. It is more abstract, more
theory, while science can be di-
rectly applied; and being theory,
it is certainly not arithmetic
(working with numbers).

Roberts is opposed to a pre-
calculus course. Most entering
freshmen have a good background
in math for calculus. If some
freshmen do have an inadequate
background in math for the cal-
culus, it is because they didn't
learn it, and not because they
were underexposed. The depart-
ment wouldn’t be able to teach it
to them, because they would be
bored by pre-calculus, having
probably already been exposed to
it in high school and not learn-
ing it. Roberts believes a pre-
calculus course would actually
form a barrier between the stvu-
dents and calculus. Besides, cal-
culus 101 doesn’t have any trigo-
nometry in it and a good math
student should be able to pick up

He would implement a pre-

were a strong demand for it, but,
“I have to be convinced of a
contribution to people’s educa-
tion.” In talking with Washing-
ton Hall, it seems there exists a
strong agreement with and sup-
port of Roberts’ position.

Next year will definitely show
whether or not a committee with
a formerly passive role can suc-
cessfully take upon itself an
active role in determining the stu-
dent body curriculum. Even if
unsuccessful in their first quest,
they still would have made the
attempt, which is something the
committee lacked in the past. It
would be to the benefit of the
student body if more student com-
mittees followed up on their sur-
veys and saw their ideas through
to the end.

er’s personality were lost in this
display of showmanship.

The best performances of the
evening were given by Warren
Mowry as the Goblin King and
by Mrs. Kahn as Aase. The latter
was particularly effective as
Peer’s old mother; though she
may hit him with her cane a few
times too often. Other notable per-
formances were given by Brian
Garr and Tama Natkin, both in
various supportive roles.

Overall, Dr. Gordon and the
University Theatre did a fine job
with a very difficult play. The
major underlying fault was a mis-
interpretation of Ibsen’s inten-
tions for the work. Peer Gynt is
meant to be fantastical and spec-
tacular, but it is also a serious
study in human psychology. The
cast created an imbalance by
pushing for too many laughs and
by ignoring the profundity of
Ibsen’s characterizations.

New library bids proposed

By the News Staff

New bids for the proposed
library have been submitted to
W&L, but there is only a remote
possibility that site preparation
may begin within the next year.

According to Frank Parsons,
Assistant to the President, new
construction bids were sought
because the previous one were
outdated and rendered practically
useless by the effect of inflation.

In April of 1974, when the last
cost estimates were submitted,
the total project cost for the
library, including all sitework,
was $8.7 million. Adding incre-
ments for the past two years, in-
flation, the University had a
figure of $10.7 million, an amount
that was considered unreasonably
high and somewhat inaccurate.

A totally new assessment was
deemed advisable, so that realis-
tic figures could be available for
planning purposes. The new bids
have been developed, and the
current cost is estimated at $9.2
million.

Deducting architectural fees
that have been paid and landscap-
ing and furnishing costs that
would not be incurred for sev-
eral years, the immediate project
cost is reduced to about $7.8 mil-
lion. The contractors who sub-
mitted the bids have indicated
that construction costs will con-
tinue to climb in the future.

It is thought that the Board of
Trustees may approve commence-
ment of the site preparation when
a major portion of the needed
funds are in hand. A continuing
impediment to the construction
is the existence of a large out-
standing loan assumed by W&L
to cover construction costs for
Doremus Gym; that loan was in-
curred when interest rates were
uncomfortably high. It would be
desirable to retire the debt be-
fore any major new project is
undertaken.

To date several million dol
lars have been collected that
might be applied to the library
construction.

Much of the efforts of the De-
velopment Office are being turned
toward retiring the gym loan and
raising enough money to begin
the library project. According to
the original timetable, funds for
the library were to have been
raised by this year, and the
people working on the develop-
ment program realize the press-
ing need for a new undergraduate
library facility.

Automatic Rule

The Committee on the Auto-
matic Rule will meet at 1:30 a.m.
on Tuesday, June 8, 1976. At that
time the Committee will consider
the following groups of students,
who have fallen under the Auto-
matic Rule, for possible immediate
reinstatement:

1. those students who failed to
meet the conditions of Academic
Probation required of them at the
end of the current Spring Term;

2. those students completing a
full academic year who failed to
meet the cumulative average re-
quired of their class.

The Committee will consider for
immediate reinstatement all stu-
dents who fall under the Auto-
matic Rule. If any student wishes
to inform the Committee of ex-
tenuating circumstances present
in his case, he may write a letter
to the Committee and deliver it
to the Office of the Dean of the
College before June 7. Immediate
reinstatement is the exception
rather than the rule.

As soon as possible after the
Committee’s meeting, each stu-
dent falling under the Automatic
Rule will receive a letter ex-
plaining his status; his parents
will receive a copy of that letter.
Any student who is not sub-
ject to the Automatic Rule in
June and who fails to achieve
the cumulative average required
at the end of a full year for his
class will be on Academic Proba-
tion for the Fall Term, and he and
= parents will receive notifica-
ion.
