(OUTLOOK andREVIEW
Practicality and the EC

Idealism grounded in reality is a wonderful concept, fot

 

through it we may improve our condition. Idealistic proposals
having little or no practical basis, however can develop into
constructions bearing little resemblance to the original idea.

Keeping this in mind, the members of the Executive Com
mittee should be lauded on their rejection of a propo a: to
set aside $5 of each student's comprehensive activities fee for
that student to designate for spending as he wishes.

Without even considering the increased paperwork and
administrative hassles such a plan would entail, the so-called
doubtless have been encumbered

“$5 check-off plan” would

with a plethora of troubles. A large portion of student fund

would have been suspended from the working budget for some

months, and ruthless campaigning for funds by established

committees would have been inevitable.

\pparent lack of interest in the proposal on the part of!
the student body would have subverted the original aim, that
being to get students involved in the budgetary process and
have them designate areas where they feel further monetar;
aid is required. The highly visible standing committees would

check-off, conceivably

have received the lion’s share of any
ending up with a larger budget than originally requested from
the EC,

Students interested in organizing a new club would have
been forced to canvass the student body to find support and
sufficient numbers of undesignated five dollar bills, Once

The load of work the EC would have saddled itself with 1

incredible. Not only would it have had to listen to exist
societies’ proposals, but it would have had to sit down and sort
out the truely valid small projec rom the really hairbrained

schemes that may have been submitted, The clerical work in

volved in keeping track of who had designated his $5 and who

had not would also have kept the EC secretary on his toes.

The idealism behind the proposal may be justifiable—giy

ing some of the power of the purse back to the student. But
that would have been pried open by in
plementation of this
