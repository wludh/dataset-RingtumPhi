A BLAST FROM THE PAST—The 1972 Mock Convention, the only

clue anyone has to what this weekend’s circus will look like phy-
sically. (The political appearance is still up in the air.) At right,
the McGovern campaign leaves the floor after the last convention
made the resounding mistake of nominating Ted Kennedy instead

of the South Dakota senator.

S.A.B. budget reviewed

The Student Activities Board
ran a deficit of about $3000 on
their four-day celebration of
Springs according to unofficial
figures released at Monday night's
Executive Committee meeting.

The board had budgeted a loss
of $6000 according to Mynders
Glover, E.C. vice-president and
treasurer. The weekend cost $17,-
900 and brought in $7,955 in gate
receipts from the Spinners con-
cert, according to the report.

Glovers said the SAB also lost
money on the Coffee House Cir-
cuit, the series of itinerant musi-
cians who play the Cockpit

The deficits were made up by
surpluses on other activities, in-
cluding the Fancy Dress Weekend,
which was budgeted to cost the
S.A.B. a net amount of $7000 and
wound up costing $3500.

Surpluses also came on the Na-
tional Lampoon Show, which cost

Nominations for the Gilliam
Award are due by 7 p.m. Monday
in the E.C. room. Any student
may be nominated, and any stu-
dent or faculty member may sub-
mit a formal letter letter of nomi-
nation. The E. C. will make the se-
lection Monday and the presenta-
tion of the award will be Thurs-
day.

$1700. The comedy routine was
budgeted to cost about $2100.

The final figures are contingent
on the outcome of an SAB dispute
with the group that engineered
the sound and lights for the Spin-
ners concert. The SAB is negotiat-
ing a reduced fee for the group
because certain persons and equip-
ment contracted for were not
brought to the concert.

The first meeting of the newly-
formed Student Activities Board
was held Sunday night in the SAB
office. Co-chairmen John Berley
and Mike Armstrong made a few
introductory statements about the
aims and focus of the new board,
and outlined the responsibilities
of each of the board positions.

Discussion was held concerning
possible themes for next year’s
Fancy Dress Bali, plans for the
November homecoming and the
construction of a musie survey
that will be distributed to stu
dents during matriculation next
year. Discussion on these topics
will resume at the next meeting.

SAB meetings will be held every
Sunday night at 6:30 and are open
to anyone who wishes to attend.
The board intends to represent
as broad a cross section of the stu-
dent body as is practically pos-
sible, and will appreciate any con-
structive “feedback” and/or “in-
put” that students present.

Mock Convention arrives:
who will Wé#L nominate?

By FRITZ GOLDBERG

At press time the telephones
in the Mock Convention offices
were never on the hooks for more
than a few seconds. Campus cam-
paign managers for the multitude
of candidates were caucusing
around a rat-infested couch argu-
ing against the conventional wis-

staying with the defending na-
tional champion for the entire
game before dropping a 16-14 de-
cision at College Park.

The Generals, 6-4, never allow-
ed the Terrapins’ 6-0, to break the
game wide open, as Maryland had
done in almost all of its previous
games.

The Terps held leads of four
goals on three occasions, but each
time W&L splashed across the
water-covered Byrd Stadium turf
to pull within a goal.

The Generals were as close as
13-12 with ten minutes remaining
before Maryland's Roger Tuck and
Greg Rumpf scored within 29 sec-

men and campaign co-ordinators
began realizing that the Mock Con-
vention is going to happen this
weekend and there is nothing
they can do about it except pick

 

onds to increase the Terps’ lead
to three.

W&L’s Jack Dudley pulled the
Generals within a pair of goals at
7:17 of the final quarter, then put
a shot past Maryland goalkeeper
Jake Reed 1 minute after, only to
have the ball carom off a goal
post.

In the resulting scramble for
the ball, W&L’s Donny Carroll
was slapped with a tripping pen-
alty, leading to Rumpf’s second
goal of the quarter which again
gave Maryland a three-goal lead,
16-13.

Kearney seored his third goal of

convention picks somebody else in

Surprisingly enough, a lot of
the political people involved with
the Mock Convention are not
ready to make a firm prediction
right now about what the out-
come of the game will be. The
same people who were saying two
weeks ago that Pennsylvania
would be the final determinant
are now sitting around looking al-
ternatively glum and _ nervous.
Others are seeming less nervous
but no less uncertain. One person
in the credentials hierarchy in-
sists that he doesn’t know who
the nominee will be, but claims
that he will be the right choice
whoever he is. Of course this is
the same nervous source who
didn't want his name used a while
back when he predicted that the
nod would go to Truman on the
fifth ballot.

The main point of concern with
the political predictors right now
seems to be whether the inevit-
able ABC, as in Anybody-But-Car-
ter, movement will be strong
enough or organized enough to
keep the piano-faced plowboy out
of the running, and if so, who do
the ABC people have to run in-
stead. Humphrey would seem the
natural choice except that no one
is sure what he will do when faced
with the choice of being the kind-
ly elder statesman of the party—
and Senate Majority Leader on
the side—or the crass gutter poli-
tico who stole the nomination

Publication people’s pay
retained for time being

The Executive Committee voted
8-3, with one abstention, not to
make any recommendation Mon-
day night to next year’s E.C. con-
cerning salaries for the editors
and business managers of the two
main student publications.

The decision on whether to con-
tinue the practice of paying the
heads of the Ring-tum Phi and
Calyx will be made next year by
the Hunter regime during its Sep-
tember budget hearings.

Out-going viee president Myn-
ders Glover argued, during a pre-
liminary discussion of whether the
F.C. should discuss the issue, that
the present E.C. should set a pre-
cedent in making some policy on
the salaries, and not “pass the
buck” te the incoming E .C

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
Thursday, May 6, 1976

Another case of double standards

Earlier in the year this column took note of an E.C, comedy
we referred to as a “parliamentary quagmire.” The editorial
Was answered in no uncertain terms by an E.C. member who
felt he and the committee had been maligned by the column,
We hope to receive an equally lucid response to this writing.
The quicksand in question this time around is constitutional,
not parliamentary, and the issue involves the spirit and the
letter of the law, and which concept the E.C.-elect is re-
quired to uphold.

In choosing the committees for next year the E.C, is con-
ducting itself for the most part as if it were already in power.
The student body constitution says committee personnel shall
be chosen by the president-elect, Tom Hunter, “subject to
the approval of the Executive Committee.” The way we read
tha clause, the appointments must be approved by the present
E.C., ie, the McCullough regime, since the new E.C. has not
yet been sworn in.

Instead the appointees are being chosen by a vote of the
E.C.—elect, a body which has no official power as yet, even
though the constitution calls for their installation “within
one week of election.” The E.C.-elect is acting as if it were
already in power in another way: by closing their meetings
when they interview applicants, a practice followed by the
present E.C. as well, in spite of a constitutional amendment
a few years back which says, “The Executive Committee shall
not go into executive session except in the case of possible
honor violations.”

In its use of power in appointing next year’s committees,

the .C.elect is acting as if it were already in office; in closing
the meetings, they claim that since the appointments are
technically the acts of Mr. Hunter alone, the meeting for
interviews is not a meeting, therefore it does not have to be
open in accordance with the constitution,

The E.C.-elect is engaging in a corrupt double-standard
in this situation, They assume enough power to choose the
people who will spend $64,000 of our money next year but
not enough that they are required to obey a direct consti-
tutional rule against closed meetings.

For the record, members of the Hunter regime who argue
for closing the interviews state that the reason for conduct-
ing the sessions in secret is so that applicants can be “more
frank.” In our office lexicon, frank means “open... candid...
sincere” (American College Dictionary) among other things.
Unless we are mistaken, these words imply honesty, a quality
that knows no degree. A man is honest or he is not—there is
no more or less involved.

We wonder whether the E.C. would not be more fair to
the persons applying for committee assignments if they
opened the meetings. By saying that the applicants cannot
be as honest in open sessions, the E.C. is implying that the
applicants are all corrupt. The E.C.-elect owes apologies to
every person interviewed in last week's closed sessions, as
well as to the 1000 students who were excluded from meetings
where the groundwork is laid for spending $40 out of every
student’s pocket next year.

—J.GF.

Of budgets, stipends and kitchens

The lame-duck committee presiding over student affairs
continues to amaze us. The outgoing E.C. once again at-
tempted to legislate a matter not in its realm of jurisdiction,
This time it was a budgetary affair that properly falls in the
lap of the E.C.-elect.

The issue at stake was the salary policy of the Publica-
tions Board, specifically, the salaries paid to editors and
business manager of campus publications. In the name of
economy Mynders Glover proposed that such stipends (for
indeed they are not salaries but bonuses given if the publica
tions operate in the black) be abolished by executive decree
Mr. Glover's main contention was that since heads of E.C.
standing committees are not given any remuneration, editors
should not be given consideration. Mr. Glover and several
other Executive Committee members continually ignored the
differentiation between bureaucratic committees and campus
media services, of which the publications are a necessary part.

A case might possibly be made for stipends for a few other
student positions, but a case for abolishment of all “salaries”
cannot logically be made. Fortunately a majority of the E.C.
members failed to follow the convoluted logic of Mr, Glover.
(Our own interests were not at stake, but those of future
editors were.) It is not as though the publications men are
being paid for the honor of the job—the constant deadline
pressures, negative reactions from students and administrators

(but little praise), contractual business dealings with the loca!
merchants, reporting directly to the Board of Trustees as
well as alumni and parents, lost sleep and grades, and the
ultimate responsibility for producing a document (single-
handedly if all subordinates leave): these are a few of the
items that differentiate the Ring-tum Phi and the Calyx from
the Contact committee and the Voting Regulations Board.
The honor of running a publication is short-lived, and the
bonus is an incentive of sorts to stick it out; otherwise the
turnover of editors would be high indeed.

Mr. Glover had a further argument, that even if some sort
of salary is justified, the fact that others don’t receive money
coupled with the fact that the funds come from the student
tax makes the current situation inequitable. What Mr, Glover
and a few others failed to realize is that the student tax does
not even cover the primary printing costs of publications,
much less attendant expenses—these items, and the “salaries,”
must be paid for from advertising revenues.

Mr. Glover, is trying to conserve energy, attempted to pull
the plug on the small electric fan in the kitchen, expecting
that the occupants would stay and swelter in the heat, After
lengthy debate, the majority of the E.C. decided that the
slight amount of electricity was worth not having a different
cook for each meal.

“Historical” synopsis
of the University

In 1749 the Augusta Academy
was established fifteen miles south
of Staunton on the road leading
from that city to New Orleans
and thence to South America.
The first equipment of the school
consisted of one building, four
tons of beans, and various minor
considerations, such as a Faculty,
class bell, and a registrar. In those
days, American history was a
popular subject, because there
wasn’t much of it and the Revo-
lution and other wars had not
come along to complicate the
course. In 1760, King George of
England paid a visit to the school
and spoke on the stamp act; this
visit was repaid in the interest
of the University by the present
head of the institution in 1921.

In 1793, Augusta Academy was
combined with Liberty Hall and
moved to Lexington. The Fancy
Dress Ball was already a flourish-
ing institution, ranking with the
Boston Tea Party and other no-
table social events. In 1802, the
academy building was getting old
and the authorities decided they
would rather have the school
about a quarter mile south. The
building was heavily insured, so
when the fire broke out it burned
rapidly; the Lexington Fire De-
partment wagon reached the scene
in 1805, but of course the flames
had already made such headway
that, fighting valiantly as they did,
they were unable to save the
structure. The ruins may be seen
to this day, standing on the very
spot where the building burned.

Two buildings were built .n
1804, but they later burned down
and are hence not standing at
the present time. In 1824, the
present main building was erected
on the spot on which it now
stands. The building has since
been propped up on each side by
wings which serve to prevent a
collapse. There are 2,456,645
burned places on the floors where
cigarette stubbs have been drop-
ped, but the house simply will
not burn.

In 1861, the Faculty declared
holiday in order that the Student
Body might take part in the
athletic games then in progress
between the North and the South.
Lexington was shelled during the
games by Northern forces, but
unfortunately neither the main
building nor V.M.I. was struck.

In 1866, the Lexington Law
School was annexed te the Col-
lege and has been regarded as
one of her most valuable liabili-
ties ever since. . . . The School
of Engineering was established
the same year, and since that
time, graduates of this department
have been connected with the con-
struction of such projects as the
Castle Hill bridge, the Lexington
Steam Roller Mill, the Rockbridge
Laundry, an dthe C.&0. station.

The Carnegie Library was form-
ally opened in 1909, and since
that time no less than three per

cent of the Student Body has
made use of the volumes therein.
In 1913, Henry Louis Smith be-
came President of the University.
Under his administration the In-
stitution has become the school
for the cream of the South, and
the Faculty has established a golf
score heretofore unheard of. Paul
M. Penick became treasurer in the
Same year; since that time there
have been but two fires, the one
in Lee’s Dormitory, which was
only partially successful, and the
Law School fire of the Spring of
1923, which was a keen disap-
pointment to the rest of the Uni-
versity on account of the heroic
work of a few Law students.

In 1919, the million-dollar
campaign was started and has now
begun to pay expenses. Consid-
erable construction work has been
done during the present year, in-
cluding a new ditch across the
front Campus for waterpipes.

From the
White Book

In a public hearing the “ac-
cused may have no more than two
advisors. These advisors may be
present at the hearing and may
ask questions of any witnesses
and the accused. The E.C. shall
have no more than two of its
own members who may ask ques-
tions of the witnesses and the
accused, and who may call any
witnesses.”

The 1975-76 Executive Commit-
tee adopted this adversary system
in hopes of achieving a more
equitable hearing than with the
former system. Under this cur-
rent procedure both the E.C. and
the accused have an equal op-
portunity to present their cases to
an unbiased jury, rather than
have the jury serve somewhat as
a prosecution.

Issue of student tax raised again

Is the current method
of dividing the student
tax an effective one?

Editor, the Ring-tum Phi:

As one of the students who
signed the petition requesting re-
fund of that portion of the stu-
dent activity fee which helped to
finance the Spinners’ concert, I've
been surprised that no one has
expressed interest in the issue
which underlies the petition. Not
only the EC, but also the editor
of the Phi and the very man who
organized the petition effort have
dismissed the petition as a rheto-
rical device. When I signed the
petition, however, | had some-
thing more in mind than merely
a theatrical gesture aimed at the
SAB.

Each semester I've been re-
quired to cough up $20 for the
activity fee, which goes to the
EC for dispersal to various campus
activities. I'm billed for the
activity fee when I pay my tuition,
which effectively means that the
treasurer's office acts as the EC's
collection agency. Now, what
have been the effects of this sweet
deal (for the EC and for the
organizations which receive a cut
of the take) upon students’ con-
trol over campus activities?

First, it has rendered pointiess
any debate about the legitimacy
of student government; for if an
agency of the administration acts
as “tax collector,” the implication

is that student government is
merely an arm of the administra-
tion.

Secondly, the current arrange-
ment eliminates student control
over campus activities, I have no
choice but to fork over $40 each
year in order to subsidize activi-
ties in which I may or may not
choose to participate. Regardless
of my feelings about, eg. the
adequacy of the Ring-tum Phi, I
know it will be supported by my
money.

Thirdly—and perhaps most im-
portantly-—the activity fee re-
moves the subsidized activities
from the pressures of real-world
financing. Our economics depart-
ment tells us that enterprizes sink
or swim on the basis of their
ability to deliver what people
want; in a sense, our dollars are
votes for or against products and
services. Not so for subsidized
campus activities. The Phi or the
SAB can do whatever they wish,
‘cause they've already gotten our
money, When you consider that
students have no control over
who runs most of the subsidized
outfits (the EC graciously screens
applicants), then it is clear that
we are doubly powerless: hence,
the Spinners debacle.

It's a curious circumstance,
given the allegedly “conservative”
bent of W&L students. We appear
to be willing to subsidize organi-
zations and publications that
wouldn't stand a chance if they
had to sell themselves to stu

dents; in fact, in conversations
with EC members concerning this
issue, I've observed that the EC
explicitly assumes that the sub-
sidized activities couldn't make it
on their own, It seems to me that
if, e.g., the Phi can’t make it on
its own merits, then it should
die.

The activity fee is, in fact, of
relatively recent origin. It used to
be that students paid a nickel for
the Phi, and they bought Calyx
at the end of the year. There was
a Contact fee. I would suggest
that arguments which see such
piecemeal financing as “imprac-
tical” are self-serving evasions
of the real issue of student con-
trol, Le., if students aren't willing
to pay for concerts, yearbooks, or
newspapers, who's to say the
students are wrong? The cus-
tomer is always right, but the
current arrangement renders the
customer irrelevant.

Thus, I saw the recent petition
as a means of getting at the
matter of subsidies, I'd very much
like to see others approach the
issue in the terms outlined above;
otherwise, we're all stuck with
activities over which we have no
control and which assume the
dimensions of self-perpetuating
bureaucracies.

Yours truly,
J. A. Skelton, '76

* . +

The current arrangement allows
student control over the campus
activities through the electoral

process. If one wants to discon-
tinue subsidies for an activity, one
votes for candidates for the E.C.
who entertain similar views.

Subsidized activities must act
within the constraints set by the
E.Cc., the faculty, or whatever;
they cannot do whatever they
want just because they have been
budgeted an amount from stu-
dent funds.

Piecemeal financing is impracti-
cal in some, though not in all.
There is a necessity for some
functions such as the newspaper
—without it, students on this non-
residential campus would have
no idea what the E.C. or the
S.A.B. were doing. The 5$.A.B.
would not be able to negotiate
contracts with the top-flight bands
everyone so dearly wants to hear,
because the limited number of
people who would attend, when a
ticket would be priced at the
true cost per student of say $10,
would make the booking too risky.

The university campus is not a
competitive marketplace, and stu-
dents are not customers; the
funded activities are services re-
quired or desired by the student
populace, and public services, like
welfare programs, are almost al-
ways subsidized.

Student likes old tie

Editor, the Ring-tum Phi:

It has come to my attention, in
this historically commemorative
year, that Washington and Lee
University is in dire need of an

appropriate old-school neck tie.
The two varieties of the school
tie now available at the local
habedasheries fail to adequately
capture and portray the grandeur
of Washington and Lee University
and, thereby, do an injustice to
the University’s reputation.

I find it somewhat ironic that
the University sanctions the pro-
duction of sheets and pillow cases
and, yet, remains incapable of de-
signing a silk tie that will allow
Washington and Lee students to
dress like Virginia gentlemen, It
is shocking to think that the ad-
ministration of the University’s

affairs have allowed the manu-
facturers of these ties to print the
silhouetted symbols of our herit-
age on a 70° dacron, four-and-
a-half-inch wide plastic style tie.
As I see it, the University has a
responsibility to re-release the old
school, one-inch wide and all-silk
W&L-designed tie which was made
available and sold in years past.
Such a gesture, while small,
would be most appreciated by
those few W&L men who are
holding out against the growing
leisure look.

Respectfully,

T. C, Greenwood

THE RING-TUM PHI J

 

Generals involved in a tight race for bids

Washington and Lee will know
ten days from now whether it will
be making a fifth consecutive ap-
pearance in the NCAA Lacrosse
Championship Tournament.

For that matter, that’s when
Cornell, Maryland, and the rest
of the Division One Schools will
learn whether their seasons are
over or if summer vacations are
delayed for a few days.

The NCAA Tournament Selec-
tion Committee will meet over the
telephone on May 16, the day af-
ter the regular season ends, to
issue tournament bids to eight
teams.

Most observers believe there are
only three spots for which any
competition exists at all. The con-
sensus is that Cornell, and Mary-
land will occupy the top two seeds,
while Navy, North Carolina, and
Johns Hopkins are involved in a
struggle for spots three, four, and
five.

No one, however, is sure which
3 teams will complete the tour-
nament field. Rather than getting
involved in a guessing game over
who those bids will go out to,
here’s a rundown on the top 10
Division One teams:

1) Cornell (10-0), No one has

stayed within five goals of the
Big Red this year, and only col-
lege division stalwart Hobart has
been in the game with Cornell af-
ter halftime (Hobart dropped a
14-8 decision). Offense is Cornell’s
forte, with All-Americans Mike
French and Eamon McEneaney on
attack among the nation’s scor-
ing leaders. Jon Levine, the third
attackman, is good for two to four
goals a game, thus forcing oppon-
ents to respect all three attack-
men.

The midfields, led by brothers
Bill and Tom Marino, are solid at
both ends of the field. There is

some question as to Cornell’s de-
fensive strength, largely because
no one team has been able to test
Cornell for an entire game. Johns
Hopkins played the Big Red even
for 25 minutes, but the Blue Jay
offense then fell apart as Cornell
went on to win 15-7.

Cornell has Princeton, Cortland
State, and Brown remaining on its
schedule. An undefeated season
might mean the top seed in the
tournament for the Big Red.

2) Maryland (6-0). Unless the
Terps’ top nine midfielders come
down with the swine flu before
the bids go out, the Terps will

WéL slighted by the media men

By PAUL SIMPSON

(EDITOR’S NOTE: The coverage
of the W&L-Maryland game had
many of the Generals’ fans out-
raged by the seeming ignorance of
their team. Paul Simpson, a senior
and former station manager of
WLUR-FM, prepared this com-
mentary on the coverage. The text
of that analysis, which appeared
on WLUR Tuesday, follows.)

No one ever said sports report-
ing had to be totally fair. The
home team’s paper and broadcast
stations can usually be relied on
to lean a little toward their team,
or at the least, give the reports
from the home team’s perspective.

But the Washington Star story
on the W&L-Maryland lacrosse
game went beyond all the bounds
of reportorial decency. The head-
line read, “Terps Weather Rain

and W-and-L” thereby equating
sort of a nagging rain and what
the Star considered a nagging la-
crosse team.

The Star article had interviews
with two members of the Mary-
land lacrosse team, All-American
midfielder Frank Urso and goalie
Jake Reed.

It’s sort of expected they would
interview, Urso ... after all, he
had an outstanding day with four
goals and two assists providing a
major chunk of the winning team’s
scoring.

But, Jake Reed? Really now. He
lets in 14 goals while making
only seven saves, and he’s inter-
viewed as though he did an out-
standing job. Not to take anything
away from Reed, but all the Star
reporter had to do was look across
the field to W-and-L goalie Charlie
Brown who had seventeen saves
while allowing sixteen goals.

Then the Star allowed that al-
though the Generals showed an
impressive offense, they had a
mediocre midfield and defense
strength.

Really? OK, let's look at the
facts once again. Granted, Mary-
land’s midfields for the most part
are better than W&L’s.

As Jack Emmer commented on
W-L-U-R last Friday, they have
the depth to run four midfields if
they so desire.

But the thing that gets me is
the comment about the defense.
All-Americans Rob Lindsey and
Tom Keigler, an underrated John
Strock and of course, Charlie
Brown have to make up one of the
best defense in the nation. And
Maryland’s attack scored four
goals the whole game. Mediocre?
I think not.

Now let’s turn to the Washing-
ton Post, just to spread the blame
around. In this case, the story was
not as blatantly critical of Wash-
ington and Lee. In fact, they
couldn’t be considering they men-
tioned the Generals exactly four
times in the whole story. If you
were just to read that story, you’d

   
  
 
  
  
   
     

think the Terps had it salted
away, even when the score was
13-12 in the fourth quarter. And
you’d never know one Washing-
ton and Lee player’s name. I guess
if you’re the Washington Post, a
four goal for four shot perfor-
mance by Rob Morgan wasn’t
worth mentioning.

I guess I could forgive all these
oversights if either of the articles
had captured the true nature of
the contest. Everyone seemed to
agree, it was a good game, that it
was close to the end, that although
it was raining and the field had
become very muddy by the end of
the game, both teams were play-
ing on the same field, under the
same conditions.

But if you really want to get
right down to a partisan W-and-L
feeling, the Generals have never
been known as a good “mud

again be found in the top four
seeds. Frank Urso and friends
have proven their skills on of-
fense, but Maryland’s seeming in-
eptitude on defense (39 f goals
allowed in their last three games)
has to be disturbing to coach
Buddy Beardmore. A good offen-
sive team that can stop the Terra-
pin midfielders from scoring
could be the team to beat Mary-
land, which has games with Army
and Johns Hopkins remaining.

3) Navy (8-1). The lone loss was
to Maryland (14-0), but some of
the wins have almost ended up
on the other side of the ledger.
The Midshipmen had to come
from behind to beat Princeton,
UMBC, Hofstra, and Washington
College, while they did not get
the winning goal against W&L un-
til 16 seconds were left. Dick Szla-
Sa again has some talented per-
sonnel on defense, including
goalie Bill Mueller, who has the
inside track for first-team All-
American honors. Jeff Long, Jim
Shulson, and Jeff Connelly are the

4) North Carolina (9-2). The
Tar Heels have finished their re-
gular season, losing only to Mary-
land (12-10 in overtime) and Navy
(10-4). UNC is virtually assured of
a bid, but there is question as to
how sharp they might be after a
four-week layoff. UNC is solid
everywhere except in the goal,
where three-year starter Chuck
Weinstein has seen little action
late in the year. UNC could be
among the top four seeds in its
first tournament appearance, de-
pending on what Johns Hopkins
does in its final two games.

team.” W-and-L has nearly always
been a team that relied on quick-
ness and stick handling to move
the ball and get it in the goal.

Not since Skip Lichtfuss two
years ago, has W-and-L really had
anyone who could really run over
people; although freshman Chris
Kearney could be leaving a few
strewn bodies on the field in the
next three years.

And, I think it safe to say, W-
and-L may not have been too keen
on taking on Maryland in the
mud. So if the Star and Post re-
porters had been on the ball and
thought about things a little more,
they might have come to the reali-

as the Star said, is patently false.

Finally, as long as we're look-
ing at journalistic inaccuracy, we
should mention the absence of the
Roanoke Times at Saturday’s
game.

The Times had made a point of
it to cover the Maryland-Virginia
game, which did end up a blowout.
But before the U.Va.-Towson State
game, a Times reporter was quot-
ed as saying the paper would not
attend the W&L-Maryland game
because, “If the Wahoos got blown
out, think what Maryand will do
to you’all.”

In fact, the Terps did not blow
the Generals out, and now all we
can hope for is better coverage as
W&L moves toward another play-
off appearance.

from the heir of Lester Maddox.

So if Hubert really is out of the
running, as some people think is
the case after his teary refusal to
run in the primaries, the party’s
options, and the MC’s, would have
to hinge on whether Udall can do
anything in the Western pri-
maries, whether Scoop Jackson
can do anything with the medioc-
re power base of delegates won so
far, and whether Frank Church
can do anything .

Those will be some of the con-
siderations to be made when a
thousand or so people converge
on a converted basketball court
tomorrow to find out whether the
students of a school with a
high percentage of Republicans
can act like Democrats for two
days.

ler and Jim Cahill standout. The
attack trio of Franz Wittelsberger,
Rich Hirsch, and Mike O’Neill is
imposing, but only O’Neill is play-
ing up to his potential, The Blue
Jay defense remains suspect,
while goalie Kevin Mahon has con-
tinued his streaky play. Hopkins
must play at Navy Saturday, then
face Maryland at Homewood Field
one week later. Those games will
determine if the Blue Jays will be
seeded in the top four.

6) Virginia (6-4). The Cavaliers’
record coula be 5-4 by the time
you read this, since a ruling on
Towson State's protest of a 16-15
loss is expected this week. The
Wahoos won a protest earlier in
the season, thus changing an 11-10
loss to Roanoke into a “no con-
test.” The four losses that still
stand have come at the hands of
Maryland, Navy, North Carolina,
and Johns Hopkins—none has
been closer than three goals. Em-
mett Voelkel and Kris Snider lead
the attack, while Paul Marchiano
and Rich Kroll are the top mid-
dies. Sophomore Cam MacLach-
lan has done an adequate job re-
placing Rodney Rullman in the
nets. Virginia has one game left-——
if you don’t know who it’s against,
this is obviously ahe first time
you've ever looked at the sports
page.

7) Massachusetts (7-2). This
could be the mystery team of
1976, much as W&L was the un-
known four years ago. UMass has
a pair of impressive wins to its
credit, over Cortland State and
Brown, while the losses have come
to Cornell and Hofstra. Attack-
man Jeff Spooner leads this team
which could be a sleeper, but
could also be a very overrated
club.

 

8) Brown (8-2). Like Massachu-
setts, Brown is a team not too
many people know a lot about.
What Cornell does know is that
Brown is the team standing be-
tween them and the Ivy League
championship—that game comes
on the final day of the season.
Midfielder Bob MacLeod is the
standout—he has a good chance
of making first-team All-Ameri-
can. The losses are to UMass and
Johns Hopkins (20-10). Brown’s
biggest win of the year came at
Hofstra’s expense, 16-8.

9) Washington and Lee (6-4).

There’s more about the Generals
elsewhere in this paper.

10) Hofstra (6-4). The Flying
Dutchman may have played them-
selves out of the playoff picture
Saturday when they dropped a 13-
7 decision to Rutgers. Only C. W.
Post remains on the Hofstra sche-
dule, and it would take losses by
at least three of the teams above

them to earn the Flying Dutchman
spot.

Those are the ten teams that
will get a look come tournament
time. Only eight will receive bids,
only one will be the eventual na-
tional champion.

It will be most interesting to
see what happens.
