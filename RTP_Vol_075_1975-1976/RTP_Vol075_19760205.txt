Trustees veto coeducation,
defer decision o Pratt gift

Washington and Lee will re-
main all-male at the undergradu-
at level the Board of Trustees
has decided.

The vote to reaflirm W&L’s
traditional undergraduate admis-
sions policy came Saturday after
extensive consideration of a two-
volume report prepared by a
special trustee committee to
study the coeducation question.

That five-member committee
had been investigating arguments
for and against undergraduate co-
education for more than a year.
In the course of its study, the
sroup assembled detailed informa-
tion from a number of other
small, private, liberal-arts  col-
leges which have themselves ex-
amined the coeducaion question
in recent years. Most of those
colleges decided to become co-
educational, and accordingly the
trustees were able to analyze in
practical terms the consequences
of ecoedueation in each.

The board also sought out and
evaluated opinions from faculty
members, students, alumni and
parents

The trustees indicated that con-
siderations of size, curriculum,
and traditional character were
the primary factors which in-
fluenced their decision.

The board concluded from the
extensive data it had compiled
that coeducation would almost
necessarily require a substantial
inerease in the size of the student
body here. There has been gen-
eral agreement throughout the
university community, among ad-
vocates of coeducation as well as
opponents, that any significant in-
crease in the university’s size
should be avoided.

Coeducation might also affect
the university’s curriculum in un-
predictable ways, the data in-
dicated, with the result that
shifts might be expected in the
traditional “mix” between liberal-
arts and pre-professional aca-

demie patterns which W&L is

determined to preserve.

The board further said that by
its vote it reaffirmed the unique
historical character of the under-
graduate divisions—that its small-
ness, all-male character, and
calibre of its faculty and aca-
demies constitute a distinct asset.

In its resolution, the board
reliterated its endorsement of the
concept of “mutually agreeable
exchange programs and coopera-
tive arrangements” with neigh-
boring women’s colleges, such as
the Eight-College Exchange Pro-
gram in which W&L and other
p.ivate colleges in the region
have participated since 1970. ‘The
colleges in that program include
two which are coeducational.
Davidson and Randolph-Macon
(Ashland), and five others in addi-
tion to W&L which are not—
Hampden-Sydney, Hollins, Mary
Baldwin, Randolph-Macon Wo-

man’s, and Sweet Briar.

The full text of the resolution
adopted by the board is: “After
considering at length the report
of the Committee on Coeduca
tion, the Board of Trustees has
concluded that Washington and
Lee should remain all-male at
the undergraduate level, with the
exception of mutually agreeable
exchange programs and coopera-
tive arrangements with our neigi-
boring women’s colleges,”

in other business, a prominent

tive, S. L. Kopald, was elected to
the Board of Trustees.

Kopald, long an active sup-
porter of W&L and a former mem-
ber of the national W&L Alumni
Association board of direciors,
wil serve an initial six-year term
as a trustee of the university.

Also, the Board of Trustees
adopted the following resolution

(Continued on page 4)

Staff donations disclosed

Members of the W&L. staff
contributed almost $60,000 toward
the development program in u
special on-campus effort this fall
directed by Dr. Leon F. Sensa-
baugh, professor emeritus of lis
tory and a former dean of the
University.

The total contributed was $59,-
685, according to a report Pr.
Sensabaugh presented to the
board of trustees last weekend at
its mid-winter meeting here.

Dr. Sensabaugh said 336 indi-
viduals — approximately three-
quarters of the University’s per-
sonnel, from clerical and main-
tenance workers to members of
the faculty and administration —
contributed to the special effort.

Their donations are entirely
apart from contributions » hich
many of them make to the Alumni
Fund, Dr. Sensabaugh pointed
out.

The $59.685 pledged was rais-
ed between October and December
1975, and does not include any
capital gifts which a number of
employees made on their own
prior to the University-wide effort
last autumn. If those prior gilts
are included, a total of $240,235
has been contributed toward the

capital development program
since 1972—-when W&L began its
ambitious development program.
which has as its 1976 goal $36
million.

The Advisory Committee which
worked with Dr. Sensabaugh has
recommended to the trustees that
$25,000 of the money raised this
fall on campus be used to endow
a special University Scholarship.
and that the rest be used toward
construction of the planned new
undergraduate library.

 

How does one prepare for the Monthly Monday Marathon described
by a certain Doctor of History as the “faculty seance”? Two examples
of the ways to face the trauma are Dr. Lamont gritting his teeth
and Dr, Lowry carrying a very thick newspaper.

EC plans warning in two areas

By JOE FITZGERALD
The Executive Committee will
begin putting up signs this week

to discourage local youngsters
from playing in the Student

Center, and to warn students eat-
ing in the Commons that eating
without paying is an infraction
subject to consideration under the
Honor System.

The E.C. will also attempt to
work with the Lexington Police
in controlling problems in the
Center. and ask the IFC to take
some action to make clear to

freshman fraternity pledges that
they are required to eat at their
frat house on certain nights

The problems present in the
dining hall were brought up by
E.C. Seeretary Sandy Stradiman
also a member of the Food Com
mittee. Stradtman said there was
evidence that as many as 17 per-
sons had gone through the chow
line twice Sunday night, and that
some students were allowing other
persons to use their meal card
numbers to secure food.

The Visit: What price justice?

 

By GRAY COLEMAN

Scheduled to open on Saturday,
February 7 at 8 p.m. is the Uni-
versity Theatre’s production of
The Visit, a tragicomedy by Fried-
rich Durrenmatt

The author, a Swiss playwright,
wrote The Visit in 1956, and the
work will go down in theatrical
history as his major aceomplish-
ment. It was first staged in this

country in 1958. as a swan song

for the legendary Alfred Lunt
and Lynn Fontanne. and was a
major critical success.

The production is directed by
Robert W. Mish, a senior major
ing in drama and German. His
reason for choosing The Visit as
his senior directing thesis is to
combine drama with Germanic
culture, and also to portray a
story that will give the audience
a night of entertaining theatre

REVIEW and OUTLOOK Hinely moves into aural arts

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Thursday, February 5, 1976

We elected these guys
to be drama critics?

The Executive Committee has put itself in the unenviable
position of having to judge the esthetic worth of a theatrical
production. It thus finds itself facing a that can be
interpreted as a motion of censure (censorship?) or support
for the dramatic arts at W&L.

You may have noticed that after
the Christmas break, Rich John-
son, the manager of the record
store in the basement of the
Co-op, was replaced by Pat Hinely,
the former school photographer.

Johnson decided to further his
musical studies at a graduate
school in Boston. According to
his friend Hinely, he eventually
plans to compose, teach and re-
cord.

It was Hinely’s friendship with
Johnson which made Hinely the
new “manager of the record de-
partment of the University Supply
Store.”

Hinely, 24, entered W&L in
1969. In the true W&L spirit,
Hinely was initiated into the Pi
Kappa Phi fraternity, the same
frat to which Johnson belonged
before he graduated in 1968.

Johnson was the manager of
the Band Box, a Lexington record
store from 1970 to 1972. He was
fired in ’72 because his ideas
conflicted with those of the com-
pany’s

After he was canned, Johnson
became the record store manager.
During his freshman vear, Hinely
became extremely interested in
music and frequently visited the

record store. The music-loving
freshman and the record store

manager soon became friends.
Hinely graduated in 1973 with
a BA in journalism. After gradua-
tion, he free-lanced for a year
and then became a W&L photo-
grapher. When he was a senior,
he was the editor of the Caylx,
the “major accomplishment of my
W&L career,” he said. He added
that several of his pictures ap-
peared in that publication.
About a year ago, Hinley de-
cided to quit photography as a
living for a while, so he could
“set into it more,” he said. At
about the same time, Johnson de-
cided to leave Lexington. The
two talked about their plans,
Johnson asked Hinley if he wanted
to become the new record store
manager, and Hinely accepted. He
took over the first of this year.
Ilinely still takes pictures. As
a matter of fact, he spent the
Christmas break in his home state
of Florida taking pictures to add
to the portfolio he is assembling
to present to news publications,
advertising agencies and the like.

 

He said that pictures he took
while he was the school photo-
erapher and while he was free-
lancing will also be added to his
portfolio.

He still does some free-lance
photography for W&L. He will
be convering the lacrosse season

and will do “photo-reportage” of
the mock convention, something

he is looking forward to, he said.

Hinely has had two one-man
shows in the past two years. He
had one in the University Center
a couple of years ago, and one
in Roanoke at the Fine Arts
Center last spring. He has also
participated in five or six joint
shows. They’re usually the win-
place-show deals. “I’ve never got-
ten a first, sometimes I place and
sometimes I show,” he said.

Speaking of the future, Hinely
said it’s a blur. The only thing
he’s sure of is that his future
will include professional photo-
graphy, “but I don’t know when
or where.” He feels, however, his
next major photographic work
“lies away from Lexington,” he
said.

“Come back after Fancy Dress.”

Bob Keatley was in charge of
keeping track of Executive Com-
mittee money last year and he
kept using that line to stall the
co-chairmen of the Student Activi-
ties Board when they returned
week after week to ask the E.C.
for $500 to cover a deficit in the
SAB film committee. The E.C.
wanted to see how many dollars
the SAB made on their big week-
end before giving them any money
to cover their losses in other
areas.

If vengeance is indeed sweet,
it must be very satisfying for this
year's SAB to be able to tell
someone to “Come back after
Faney Dress.”

That's the line they use to stall

vention when the MC people come

Delegates

party on May 6, the Thursday
night before the quadrennial at-
temp! at second-guessing the
Democratic Party. Perhaps the
idea of the D-day party is to use
it for a last-ditch effort to fill
some of the less organized state
delegations.

Barring that approach or a
recruitment drive at the lacrosse

games, the gathering of warm
bodies to fill the jobs in the

delegations and the MC commit-
tees will continue to be a varied,
multi-pronged attack on the
apathy of the average W&L
gentleman.

First there will be a new piece
of seneral distribution literature
on the MC, something like a
“eampaign pamphlet” according
to Dave Braun, chairman of the
MC media committee, to supple-
ment the red, white, and blue
brochure put out earlier this year.
The MC is “gunning for around
Fancy Dress” on that, according
to Braun.

There will also be an insert in
this publication according to pres-
ent plans, and sometime in the
middle of March, the MC people
may set up tables in the dining
hall again, staffed by loyal MC
jankies who will pull unwary per-
sons out of the supper line and
put them to work on the delega-
tion from the American attache
offve in Peking. “After that,”
said Braun, “It’s going te be up
to the state chairmen” to fill their
d-legations.

Based on past conventions, they
will p‘ebably be able to finish
the job of recruitment before the
MC rolls around on May 7. AIl-

Increased dryer prices

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

Lee Washington felt himself
fortunate today. Not only had he
been able to bum a quarter to

do a wash, and three dimes to
thoroughly drv one load of
clothes, but he had also found

an empty washer and dryer out
of the four of each available to
the more than 400 students whe
live in the dorms

Lee deposited his quarter in the
washing machine and then sat

down to catch up on some much
needed studying. When his spin-
dryless load was completed, he
removed his sopping wet clothes
from the washing machine and
placed them in the aged dryer.
He was frustrated by the know
ledge that he would have to spend
3 forty minute periods and three
dimes to dry one load of clothes,
but somehow he had managed to
eonsole himself of this fact of
life.

He placed his first dime in
the coin slot and much to his
dismay, noticed that the dime was
undersized for the slot. He check

tions are closed and others are

right now lie in whether the sev-
eral state will be able to raise
the money they need to carry
their allotted tasks.

The amount of money each
state is required to raise varies
depending on the size of the
state and the number of W&L
students from that state. Each
state is required to spend at least
$100 on its float for the parade
that will open the festivities on
May 7. In addition to that amount,

Georgia is one state that is do-
ing well so far as its fund-raising
goes. According to Rodney Cook,
one of the state’s chairmen, the
money for the MC Journal is
raised, and the state is thinking
about spending $300 on its float.
But then, Georgia is represented

by 62 students at W&L.
Other states do not have 62
students here. Kansas has ap-

Generals win three, lead league

By SAMMY THOMPSON

Washington and Lee’s basket
ball team added three more vic-
tories to its list last week and
increased its winning streak to
11 games.

The Generals edged Bridge
water, 72-68, Tuesday, and then
beat Virginia Wesleyan, 74-60,

Swimmers

dunk WésM

The W&L swimming team dis-
paved wny they are probably one
of the best small college teams in

the country with an impressive
performance here last Saturday
by defeating William and Mary

69-44. John Hudson remain; the
only swimmer to lead both Di
visions II and HII of the NCAA
in two events. He remains unde
feated in both the 500 and 1099
freestyle, and has easily qualified
for the nationals, which are to
be held later this year.

Tad Van Lee won both the 50
and 100 yard freestyle, and he
also has qualified for the nation-
als. Tad remains undefeated in
dual meet competion for the last
3 years. a tremendous example
of concistency in itself. He is
No. 1 in Division HI in the 50
vard freestyle, and he maintains
this status even though he has to
swim a number of relays each
meet.

Freshman Chip Hoke set a nev
school record in the 200 yard
backstroke, while another out
standing freshman, Keith Romich,
won the 209 freestyle. Senior cap
tain Rod Scott won the 500 vard

freestyle and the 200 yard indi-
viduil medley
Billy Cogar. who swept both

diving events, has also qualified
for the nationals and remains un-
defeated this year. The Generals,
who are now 6-1 on the year,
are finished with their home meets
for this season. They will compete
next at American University on
Friday night.

and Christopher Newport, 64-62,
over the weekend. The victories
give W&L a 13-3 record overall
and a league-leading 8-1 record
in the Virginia Conference Athle-
tic Association (VCAA).

Captain John Podgajny led the
scoring for W&L in the Bridge-
water game with 16 points and
forward Bob Flint had 12. Fresh
man Mike Wenke sealed the vic-
tory for the Generals, however,
when he hit six of six free-throws
in the final minutes of play.

Bridgewater had a 43-40 lead
at the half and pulled away to
a; much as a seven-point spread
m'dway through the second half.
Podgajny and Wenke brought
W&L back and the game ended
with the Generals ahead by four

Friday the Generals took on
Virginia Wesleyan for the second
time this season. W&L had beaten

them by 15 points Jan. 17. This
game was not won so easily how-
ever,

The “Blue Marlins” played well
enough to take a 37-33 lead at the
half. Coach Canfield said W&L
stood around against the Marlins’
zone defense in the first half.

Canfield said the defense held
in the second half long enough
fur W&L to reel off eight points
straight and enable a come-from-
behind victory. Freshmen Dave
Leunig and Artie Collins spurred
the Generals on. Jeff Baum came
up with some big rebounds and
W&L won 64-62. Podgajny led all
scorers with 20 points and Leunig
was second with 10.

Saturday W&L traveled to Chis-
topher Newport College in New-
port News. The Generals started
off slowly in a game that they

evertually won by 14 points. Can-

field said W&L eventually shot
68 per cent from the floor in the
first half. Canfield praised the
defense in general and the de
fense of Bob Flint in particular.
Canfield said the four corner stall-
defense had never been executed
better. W&L ended up winning
74-60 for their eleventh win in a
row,

The Cenerals faced Lynchburg
College, the only team to defeat
them in VCAA competition this
year, Tuesday night. W&L will
hest Emory and Henry tonight at
8 pin. and will travel to Norfolk
Saturday to meet defending Di-

vision II national champion Old
Dominion.

Junior Tad Van Leer displays the skill and determ nation that has left him undefeated in dual meet

(Continued from page 1)
saying that any unwelcome guests
anywhere in the Center besides
the Cockpit were subject to arrest.
The job of keeping watch for
these persons, detaining them if
possible, and summoning the
police, will be handled by a group
tentatively called the Police-Stu-
dent Liaison Committee. The com-
mittee was proposed by Freshman
representative Billy Webster.

Also, the E.C. decided to wait
until next week before making
any decision on a recent re-
quest from Brian Garr for $50 to
buy scripts and props for a play
he is directing, The Boys in the
Band. The play is an extra pro-
duction not covered by the Uni-
versity Theatre budget.

Leland McCullough suggested

that the decision be put off until

the E.C. could find out the
opinions of the student body on
the production. McCullough asked
Garr whether the play would con-
tain anything that might offend
townspeople attending the pro-
duction. “I would like to make
sure they don’t think we're a
bunch of derelicts up here,” Me-
Cullough said.

Pugh said he would like to see
a return to “traditional plays,’
mentioning that he would like to
see Arsenic and Old Lace. Bob
Couch, a member of the Minority
Affairs Co-ordinating Committee,
mentioned that the E.C. might be
infringing on the rights of homo-
sexuals in its questioning of the
play. “Pugh, you’re walking on
thin ice,” he warned.

“Throughout its history, Wash-

relied on—and always has re-
ceived—the critical support,
spiritual and tangible, of those
whom Dr. Francis Pendleton
Gaines once described as ‘Friends
of Education’... If ever there has
been a true Friend of Washington
and Lee—a true Friend of Educa-
tion—it was that gracious gentle-
man of Chatham Manor...

hearts and gratifies us.”
