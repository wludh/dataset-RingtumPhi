the defeat,

The Generals hustled and played

sy SAMMY THOMPSON

There is no doubt about it —
Washington and Lee has absoutely
no luck when it comes to playing
football. For the second week in a
row the Generals have seen oppor-
tunities for victory go for nought.
This time, against Centre College, a
late fourth guarter rally brought the
Generals close but a missed extra
point and a 35-yard field goal at-
tempt that was wide to the left
ruined their victory hopes. As a
result, the Generals had to settle for
a 9-9 tie bringing the season record
to 0-1-1,

The Generals got on the score-
board first late in the opening period,
After the defense stopped Centre on
a fourth and one situation, W&L
took over on their own 30 yard line.
Krom there, a run by Jack Berry and
passes to Mark George and Tony
Perry brought the Generals down to
the Centre 9 yard line, A costly
fumble on second and goal and an
incomplete third down pass, which
was called pass interference and then
overuled, prevented a touchdown, On
fourth and goal with 4:18 remaining
Dan Thompson kicked a 35-yard field
goal giving the Generals a 3-0 lead.

‘The second quarter was unpro
ductive for W&L as the offense failed
to move the ball. Berry was off target,
missing on four passes, The running
game also slacked off, Rich Moncure
was the only W&L runner to gain
any substantial yardage, rushing 6
times for 20 yards, The Generals got
only one first down while Bruce
Howard was forced to punt four
times.

O

Centre theatened the entire second
quarter but did not succeed until
the final four minutes, Quarterback
Richard Riney passed to Mark Davis
twice for a total of 34 yards bring-
ing the Colonels down to the W&L
15 yard line. Failing to get the first
down with time running out in the
half, Centre went for a field goal.
The attempt by Jim Akin was good
but Centre was penalized for illegal
procedure and they had to try it
again, Then on third and 13, Akin’s
35-yard kick went straight through
the uprights just beating the buzzer
ending the second half. Halftime
score: W&L 3-Centre 3.

The Generals came close to scoring
carly in the third period after Berry
passes to Mark George and Richard
Wiles put W&L on the Centre 14
yard line. Failing to get a_ first
down, W&L went for a field goal.
Ihe snap from center bounced be-
fore reaching holder Rocky Joyner
and Dan Thompson was forced to
run. A Colonel defender dropped
him on the 25 yard line for an 11
yard loss and Centre took over first
and 10,

Phe third quarter was scoreless
until the final 2 minutes. Centre took

line after

over on their 24° yard
holding W&L on a fourth and 13
play, On second and 7 from the

Centre 46, Riney hit tight end Dan
Young with a pass. W&L defender
Charlie Brown tried in vain to
break it up but Young eluded him
and scampered 54 yards for the I IY.
Akin’s extra point attempt was no
good and W&L trailed 9-3.

deadlock with Centre

The final score came late in the
fourth quarter, Jack Berry spurred
the General attack passing to Mark
George and Richard Wiles for first
downs. Runs by Berry and Ed John-
son brought W&L to the Centre 7
yard line. On first and goal with 2:07
remaining, Berry hit spohomore Bob
Szczecinski with a pass for the TD.
The extra point attempt that fol-
lowed was unsuccessful as Rich
Moncure, attempting a run, was
stopped short of the goal.

The second opportunity for the
Generals came with 12 seconds left
in the game. Dan ‘Thompson at-
tempted a 35 yard field goal but the
kick was wide to the left and the
final score stood: W&L 9-Centre 9. It
was a hard fought contest and W&L
deserved to win—too bad Centre
didn’t see it that way.

Harriers split
in 3-way meet

Sheperdstown College was a_ piece
of cake for both Washington and
Lee and Davis & Elkins, but in the
long run D&E’s meal tickets lasted
slightly longer as the Generals failed
to conjure up any last second miracles
and were forced into second place
in last Saturday's cross country meet
in Shepherdstown, W. Va.

Both the Generals and D&E proved
to be rude houseguests indeed by
humiliating Shepherdstown by scores
of 15-42 and 15-45 respectively. The

match’s outcome easily may have
gone in the General's favor had it
not been for D®&E’s first class

thoroughbred, John Magee, who took
top honors in the meet with a 24:51
time in the 4.75 mile run, Magee’s
closest. pursuer, W&L's Tem Wash-
ington, finished 37 second later, lit-
erally light years in cross country,

The General's 25-30 loss to Davis
and Elkins was disappointing but
certainly not disgraceful, Neverthe-
less, the five point conquest did give
D&E a shot of confidence which
could prove to be considerable factor
in future encounters, General coach
Dick Miller appears to be calm and
unruffled and is busy preparing his
troops for this Saturday's showdown
at V.M.1. against the  cross-town
rival Keydets. Other schools compet-
ing in the upcoming event will be
Hampton Institute, Norfolk State
and Roanoke.
