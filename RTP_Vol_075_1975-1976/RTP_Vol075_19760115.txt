Pratt bequeaths $11 million to W&L

Special to the Ring-tum Phi

Washington and Lee University will receive 20 per cent of the
estate—approximately $11 million—of the late John Lee Pratt, a
prominent business executive and philanthropist who died Dec. 20
in Fredericksburg, Va., at the age of 96.

The bequest is to be used for faculty salaries and student financial
aid.

Washington and Lee is one of 10 colleges and universities which
received multi-million dollar bequests from Mr. Pratt’s estate. In
addition to Washington and Lee, the University of Virginia and
Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University also received 20
per cent shares of the estate. Mr. Pratt’s other bequests ranged from
4 per cent to 10 per cent of the estate.

Under terms of Mr. Pratt’s will, which was filed for
Friday in Stafford County Circuit Court in Fredericksburg, the be-
quest to Washington and Lee is to be used “to increase salaries” for
faculty members and to permit the university to “offer more scholar-
ships for outstanding students.”

None of Mr. Pratt’s bequests are to be used for constructing
or improving buildings or for land acquisition. He also expressed
the wish that all the bequests which he made to academic institutions
in the will be spent within 25 years.

“It is my belief,’ he wrote in his will, “that the capital I leave
can best serve the purpose I desire by being converted into knowledge
that is useful and beneficial to mankind without undue delay.”

On learning of the bequest—the largest gift in Washington and
Lee’s history—the university said in a statement: “Over the past
two decades, John Lee Pratt has been one of this university’s most
devoted supporters.

“His association with and fondness for this institution trace to
his close personal friendships with several of the university’s dis-
tinguished trustees, but particularly to the strong mutual affection
which grew up between himself and the late president of Washington
and Lee, Dr. Francis Pendleton Gaines, and Mrs. Gaines.

“While we have treasured Mr. Pratt’s friendship and devotion
for more than 20 years, nevertheless we are a little overwhelmed—
and, in fact, at the moment speechless—in learning of his bequest.

“The university’s board of trustees is scheduled to meet on the
campus here for its regular mid-winter meeting at the end of this
month. The board will of course have the responsibility for determin-
ing the specific ways in which Mr. Pratt’s bequest will be used to
the best advantage of the university in helping meet his ambition
for Washington and Lee; the board will also certainly want to de-
termine the ways in which the university will formally acknowledge
his historic generosity and honor his memory.”

While the Washington and Lee bequest is designated to strengthen
salaries and expand the university’s student financial aid programs,
Mr. Pratt’s bequests to the University of Virginia and Virginia Tech
are subject to additional provisions.

If either institution does not or cannot comply with the terms
of Mr. Pratt’s will, he specified that the bequests should then come
to Washington and Lee.

The University of Virginia’s bequest is to be used to strengthen
faculty salaries and to purchase equipment in the biology, chemistry,
mathematics and physies departments, and to support research and
provide scholarships in the medical school there.

The Virginia Tech bequest is designated partly for
of animal nutrition” and partly for expanded research
ship opportunities in the Schoo! of Engineering.

The bequests to both state-supported universities are subject to
the additional provision that ihe money Mr. Pratt left must not be
used as a substitute for state appropriations. If that should happen,
he provided that the bequests would then also be given instead to
Washington and Lee.

In addition to the 20 per cent shares of his estate to Washingion
and Lee, Virginia, and Virginia Tech, Mr. Pratt left 10 per cent to
Randolph-Macon Woman’s College in Lynchburg and to Johns
Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, to support both the
geography school there and the McCollum-Pratt Institute, which he
helped establish and which conducts research in the field of “trace
elements” or “micronutrients.”

He also left 4 per cent shares of his estate,

“the study
and. scholar-

valued at approxi-

mately $2.2 million each, to Hollins College, Sweet Briar Col ege,
Hampden-Sydney College, Hampton Institute and Randolph-Macon

College.

The terms of each of those bequests are identical to the terms
of Washington and Lee’s. Again, Mr. Pratt favored Washington and
Lee by providing in the will that if any of those legacies fails, then
it is to come to Washington and Lee.

Mr. Pratt was a student for one year at Randolph-Macon Colleg2

in Ashland, then transferred to the University of Virginia, wher.
he received his degree in civil engineering in 1995.
After graduation he joined E. I. duPont de Nemours & Co. of

Wilmington, Del., and eventually rose in that company and in General

Motors, with which duPont merged in 1917. Iie was elected GM
vice president in 1922, became a director of the company a year
later, was a member of the executive committee for 11 years, and

served in other executive capacities with the GM board until 1952.

During World War II he worked as an unpaid consullant to
the American government, largely in developing the Lend-Lease
Program.

“He was a very private man,” the co-executor of his estate
Atty. Ralph M. Whitticar UI, was quoted as telling the Washington
Post. “If that’s the way he wanted it to be, that’s the way it should
be” even after his death, Whitticar said.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Thursday, January 15, 1976

John Lee Pratt

The students of this University are deeply indebted to the
late John Lee Pratt, philanthropist par excellence, who saw
fit to bequeath to Washington and Lee one-fifth of the fortune
he had amassed in his ninety-six years in this life.

1976 is the final year in the University’s $36 million
development program. Until noon last Friday, that goal was
still $8 millnon away. In dollar amounts, that target figure
has been reached. The student financial aid program now
appears to be out of the woods, and faculty salaries can be
increased and several endowed chairs established.

It should be noted, and emphasized strongly, that the
bequest does not assure the construction of the long-awaited
library. The Pratt money is to be used specifically for pur-
poses other than new construction. And the money cannot
be put into, say, endowment and other funds withdrawn to
facilitate construction without violating the intend of Pratt’s
will.

The continued support of our alumni and friends is as
important now as it ever was. Even more so, for other gifts
may now seem so insignificant when compared to that
mammoth sum, and yet the help of others is still needed if
the library is to become a reality.

The legacy of John Lee Pratt will not soon be forgotten,
He thought highly of Washington and Lee and what this
college stands for; let us continue to make this University
the true liberal arts institution that Pratt so strongly believed

in.

How to cross the E.C.
in one simple step

When money is appropriated for a specific purpose, but
is not used for that stated purpose, approval must be sought
before alternative uses are made of the funds. This is an
old and time-honored principle of sound financial manage-
ment and fiseal responsibility.

We have on previous occasions reminded the members of
the Executive Committee of their responsibility to see to
it that student funds are expended with discretion. Heretofore
we have not taken it upon ourselves to remind the groups
financed with student money that they have a similar obliga-
tion, Now would be an appropriate time.

On December 1, 1975, the E.C. voted to appropriate a
sum in the amount of $1000 to the Student Association for
Black Unity to assist that group in its efforts to bring to
campus Thomas Scott Young, a black poet and dramatist.
Last night in Lee Chapel there was scheduled an appearance
by Imamu Amira Baraka (formerly LeRoi Jones), noted
black playwright and poet.

What disturbs us is that S.A.B.U. did not check with its
financial backers, notably the E.C. and the Glasgow Endw-
ment, before arranging for the appearance of Baraka in lieu
of Young. Agreed, Baraka is better known than Young and
presumably .presented a better show, but no money was
appropriated for the event by the E.C. until Monday night,
when the poet's appearance was cirtually a fait accompli.

It would have been a very simple matter for Mr. Brooks,
the head of S.A.B.U,, to have reported to the KC. on the
change of plans and to have requested continued support at
the E.C. meeting of January 5, Instead, Mr. Brooks appeared
hefore the Committee on January 12, at the behest of sev-
eral Committee members, and after it) was evident that
arrangements for the revised program had been consummated.
Had he not been specifically asked to attend, said Mr. Brooks,
he would not have reported on the change on his own
initiative.

At the meeting, Mr. Brooks was unsure of the final
contract price, other than to surmise that it was “around
$2250 as opposed to $1750 for Young.” In other words, an
additional $500 was needed to pay for the performance. The
Glasgow Endowment had agreed to fund an extra $300,
and other S.A.B.U! Black Culture Week events were being
curtailed to cut expenses, but it was unclear at Monday night's
meeting if the $500 deficit would be met, In other words, it
is possible that the EC, might have to pay the balance for
an event it did not approve beforehand,

It is not right for any student group, be it SA.B.U., S.A...
or the Ring-tum Phi, to spend money for reasons not origi-
nally specified when funds are sought from the EC, Such
practices might lead to all manner of problems and shady
undertakings.

It is not our intention to castigate the 5 \.B.U.
normal rules of procedure should be

un
necessarily. However,
followed, particularly when student funds are involved, All
2.C,-funded organizations should realize their obligation to
duly notify the student government when changes are made

that are of significance.

Harriet Thomas,

A private man, a public legacy

The following is extracted
from the article “John Lee
Pratt Walked With Famous,
Shunned Fame,” by John Gool-
rick, in the Fredericksburg
(Va.) Free Lance-Star, Dec. 22,
1975.

John Lee Pratt rose from a boy-
hood on a King George (Va.)
County farm to become one of the
nation’s wealthiest men.

Pratt was a former vice presi-
dent and director of General
Motors Corp. and a philanthropist
who quietly and without fan-
fare gave away hundreds of
thousands of dollars to orgniza-
tions and causes he deemed
worthwhile.

Once called by Alfred P. Sloan,
former president of General
Motors, “the best businessman I
have ever known,’” Pratt was an
intimate friend of most of the
nation’s top industrialists and
prominent politicians and other
publie personalities.

But because he shied away
from public attention, he was
little known to the general pub-
lic, though Fortune magazine list-
ed him in a survey some years
ago as 17th on a list of the 50
wealthiest persons in the United
States.

(In 1964, Time magazine re-
ported that Mr. Pratt was then
the second-largest _ individual
shareholder of General Motors
stock in the nation, “close be-
hind” Alfred P. Sloan. Despite his
wealth, Time said, “Pratt so suc-
cessfully keeps out the public view
that he is not even listed in
‘Who’s Who’.”)

His career with GM spanned a
half-century, and during that time
he was a key figure in the com-
pany’s rise from a young and
struggling enterprise to one of
the greatest corporate giants the
world has ever known.

Gracious host at Chatham

Pratt in 1931 purchased the
historic Chatham estate which
dates to Colonial times and had
spent most of his life there since
his retirement as a vice presi-
dent of GM in 1937. (Dr. Francis
Pendleton Gaines, president of
Washington and Lee from 1930
to 1959, and Mrs. Gaines visited
Mr. Pratt at Chatham on many
occasions. After one such visit,
Dr. Gaines wrote: “I don’t know
a more beautiful home, and I
don’t know a host whose hospi-
tality is more complete and more
gracious.”)

In 1961 Pratt donated to the
cily of Fredericksburg and Staf-
ford County 75 acres of the
Chatham estate with the stipula-
tion that a park be established
on the site.

He was born Oct. 22, 1879, at
Aspen Grove in King George
County. [Ne was the last survivor
of the five children of his par-
ents, all of whom lived to ad-
vanced ages.

Pratt’s mother died in 1885
when he was six years old, and
he was tutored at home and later
attended Bethe! School in the
White Oak area of Stafford. When
he was 13, Pratt was employed
as an apprentice by M. S. Chan-
cellor Farm Implement Store in
Fredericksburg, and there, as-
sembling horse-drawn equipment,

Editors, Ariel

Thymes critic scored
Editer, The Ring-tum Phi:

I was amused when I read the
letters to the editors section of
the last Ringtum Phi and felt
it was my duty as a responsible
member of the Washington and
Lee student body to reply to Mr,

he had his introduction to basic
machinery, a prelude to his engi-
neering career.

Pratt for a time attended Locust
Dale Academy, a private school
in Orange, and after a year at
Randolph-Macon College he en-
tered the University of Virginia,
where he was graduated as a
civil engineer in 1905.

After graduation, Pratt had
offers to go with the EI. du-
Pont de Nemours & Co. and with
the American Bridge Co. AIl-
though the job with American
Bridge would have paid more, a
professor advised him to take the
duPont offer, because he felt it
would provide more valuable ex-
perience.

Just before Labor Day weekend
of 1905, Pratt traveled to Wilm-
ington, Del., to go to work for
the company. When he got there,
he found the place was closed for
the holiday, but he managed to
persuade a company executive to
let him remain through the week-
end and start work early.

By the time the plant opened
again, Pratt had finished figur-
ing a job the company had ob-
tained on the Delaware River and
made a favorable first impression
on company officials.

From duPont to GM

His work with duPont brought
him to the attention of Col. H.
M. Barksdale, then a high-rank-
ing duPont official who recognized
him as an exceptionally able per-
son. Barksdale sent Pratt to New
York to work closely with top
officials of the company and dur-
ing this period Pratt also travel-
ed extensively around the coun-
try selecting sites for new du-
Pont plants. Among places he
selected were two in Virginia, at
Waynesboro and an area which
grew into what is now Hopewell.

At one point, before he came
to Barksdale’s attention, Pratt
became discouraged and returned
to King George, where he taught
school about a year. But he was
persuaded to return to duPont
and from then on his star rose
meteorically.

In 1917, duPont and the fledgl-
ing General Motors associated
with one another, and from time
to time duPont executives were
made available to W. C. Durant,
General Motors president, on
special assignment.

in 1918, General Motors built
a number of homes for its em-
pioyees around Detroit, but
Durant was puzzled because al-
though the homes were well built
and priced reasonably, few em-
ployees were buying or renting
them.

He asked duPont for assistance
and Barksdale sent him Pratt,
whom he called his expert on
housing. Pratt examined General
Motors’ payroll records and work-
ed all night to boil his report
down to two paragraphs which
said, in essence, employees were
not buying or renting the homes
because they were not being paid
enough by the company to afford
them.

The simple and incisive report
so impressed Durant that he ask-
ed Pratt to go to work for him
as a special assistant, and in
December 1919 Pratt left duPont
and went to GM.

One of his assignments there
was to take care of a proposed
liquidation of the  then-infant
Frigidaire Division. Pratt went to
the Frigidaire plant in Ohio and
informed the manager the plant
was to be closed. The manager
begged him first to talk to some
people who had bought Frigi-
daires, and Pratt agreed. He visit-
ed a number of homes, and at
each stop, on informing women
he was with Frigidaire, was met
with a barrage of complaints
about the company product.

But when Pratt offered to re-
fund their money to the custom-
ers in full, all the wemen refused
the offer. He realized that despite
defects in the product, customers
who used Frigidaires would not
part with them to go back to the
old icebox, and as result the
plant was kept in operation. In
years to come, Pratt was instru-
mental in development of a better
refrigerator as well as a safe
refrigerant, Freon.

In March 1921, Pratt was named
general manager and group
executive o fthe accessories di-
vision of General Motors. He was
elected vice president in 1922
and continued in that capacity
until his retirement in 1937.

While corporation vice presi-
dent, Pratt worked from a small
office in the General Motors
building in New York and lived
at the Hotel McAlpin in a small
suite. He never worked for any
one division of General Motors
but served as an official of the
entire corporation.

Auto starter sand diesels

When World War I broke out,
Pratt tried to enlist in the service
but was rejected because of a
physical disability. One of his
most important roles with GM
was helping it acquire the Dayton
Electric Co., which in turn de-
veloped an automobile self-starter
small enough to be used feasibly
in cars. Thus the era of the hand
starter, or crank, came to an end.

Pratt was also called upon to
promote diesel engines being
made by one of the company’s
divisions. Until that time diesel
engines were used mainly in
boats, and there weren’t enough
sales to justify continued pro-
duction. Pratt persuaded Sea-
board Air Line Railway, then in
receivership, to begin using diesel
locomotives. The savings proved
to be revolutionary and soon all
major railroads were using
diesels.

Elected a director of General
Motors in April 1923, Pratt served
as a member of the company’s
executive committee from Sept.
1, 1924, to its dissolution in 1935.
He was a member of the bonus
and salary committee for a 10-
year period beginning in 1937. He
also served as a member of the
financial policy committee from
June 1946 until January 1952.

During World War Il, Pratt
served the country as an unpaid
consultant and was a moving fac-
tor in development of the Lend-
Lease Program and its adoption
by Congress. The head of Lend-
Lease, Edward Stettinius, who
had worked under Pratt at Gen-
eral Motors, was a great admirer
of Pratt and asked him to help
with the new program.

While getting Lend-Lease
organized, Pratt traveled to a
number of countries, including
England, where he met Prime
Minister Winston Churchill. Pratt
sometimes recounted to friends
that Churchill had remembered a
visit he made to Fredericksburg
in the mid-1920s.

Voluminous testimony

Pratt’s highly retentive memory
served him in good stead when
in the 1950s the government
brought its famous anti-trust act-
ion against the duPont Company
to force it to divest itself of its
holding in General Motors.

During the years of the long,
drawn-out hearings in the du-
Pont action, depositions taken
ran into the millions of words.
Pratt’s testimony alone covers

’Good ol’ boy’ enlivens Cockpit

By FRITZ GOLDBERG
Music Editor-at-large

Paul Carney is a good ol’ boy
from Yonkers who plays piano
and foosball. Although good ol’
boys are generally thought to be
of Southern origin, this week's
Cockpit performer fits the bill in
a grand manner.

His first set begins with a
musical invitation to the audience

THE EDITOR

Gray's letter.

I am sorry to say that Mr.
Gray lost a great deal of force
in his eritical analysis simply be-
cause he chose to approach the
Thymes from a pompous position,
tis word choice seems as weak as
that of the Thymes writers. Ex-
pressions like “journalistic mas-
turbation” and the like hardly
place the critic above the level of
the writers he abhors. Surely a
senior English Major can do bet-
ter. Perhaps some moderation
would help him in his construe-
tive eriticism.

I think Mr, Gray and | agree
when we condemn the Thymes
for its language and perhaps even
some of the relevance of its
articles. It should not be neces-
sary to use colloquial expressions
to shock the reader if the written
message is “pertinent.” Then
egein the Ring-tum Phi could
learn a lesson from the human
interest topics raised by the
Thymes to enliven its own drab
pages. Let us hope that if the
student body chooses to support
either or both of the journals,
that the editors will at least com.
form to the standards of formal
prose in enlightened and inquisi-
tive journalism

to “Get Down to the Music.” There
is a lot more reverb in the amp
than with other performers we
have seen so far on the Coffee
House Circuit, and a lot more re-
sponse from the listeners than we
saw with the SAB’s last star. The
song, like most of Carney’s stuff,
is no less than funky, and would
make good dance music if there
were enough room in the Cockpit.

After the first song, the mood
is calmed by two slower songs
“Loving You,” dedicated to the
lovers in the audience, and “I'm
So Tired,” played to the miles
Carney spent on the road Monday,
a song that unfortunately em-
ploys the worst key on a piano
that could conceivably be tuned
better.

Another song talks about New
York City and crowds in a jumpy
and comicly desperate fashion. It
is followed by a song from Car-
ney’s one album, a rather unsuc-
cessful, unpromoted flop from five

years ago. Then the intro is over,
the man is acquainted with his
audience and it is time to heed
his earlier injunction to get down
to the music.

“A little boogie song” called
“Hanging Around” begins with an
invitation to the audience to
“make a little noise.” The noise
is half-hearted and many per-
formers might be discouraged if
they asked the audience ot clap
along and got little response.
Carney is not stymied. Barring
clapping in rhythm, he asks the
audience to scream in a later song.
They do.

Carney is a performer, not an
artist, and perfectly suited to the
crowds he is likely to encounter
in the Cockpit. The schedule for
his shows is posted in several
places on campus for those who
want to come down and get down
to the music and scream along
with Carney. The SAB has got a
live one this time.

Generals victorious in tournament

By SAMMY THOMPSON

It was an exciting weekend of
sports for Washington and Lee
basketball fans. If you like close
games with a lot of action, you
shouldn’t have missed the Wash-
ington and Lee Invitational
Tourament held Friday and Satur-
day night in Doremus gym.

The Generals emerged as the
champions Saturday after beating
Lycoming College 78-75 in the
championship game. Friday night
W&L edged Lock Haven State
73-70 to enable them to meet
Lycoming in the final. Lycoming
received their berth by beating
Salisbury State 80-79 in the first
game Friday night.

Besides captain John Podgajny,
Coach Canfield shuffled around his
lineup Friday night against “The
Haven,” starting two freshmen
and two juniors, Dave Leunig,
Mike Wenke, Don Berlin and Bob
Flint. Senior Norm Kristoff saw
limited action due to a shoulder
injury received in practice.

“The Haven” proved to be a
pest in the first half of play. The
Generals won the opening tip
and took the first lead of the
game after a Wenke basket.
Podgajny contributed 8 of his
total 24 points in the first seven
minutes to keep W&L ahead. With
12:38 remaining in the half, how-
ever, Lock Haven tied it at 18 all.
Three costly W&L turnovers gave
them the lead at 24-18 a minute
later.

3ut the Generals came back
with the help of 6-2 junior Pat-
Dennis and senior Jeff Baum.

Varsity football captains chosen

Rising senior Tony Perry, one
of the top all-time pass-catchers
in W&L football history, and ris-
ing junior Jeff Slatcoff, one of the
best defensive players ever to don
a Generals’ uniform, have been
selected co-captains of the 1976
football squad.

Perry, a tight end from Waynes-

boro, Va., and Slatcoff, a line-
backer from Windber, Pa., near
Pittsburgh, were chosen in bal-
loting by squad members.

“The squad couldn't have
chosen two finer leaders,” head

coach Bill McHenry commented.
“In addition to their outstanding
athletic ability, they are totally
committed and dedicated to a job

that must be done—leading us
to a complete turnaround in
1976.”

Swimming team

Washington and Lee’s unde
feated swimming team kept its
record intact with a narrow 61-52
victory last Saturday over Vir
ginia Tech in Blacksburg. Coach
Bill Stearns’ Generals won the
last relay event of the day to
win its third meet of the year

The Generals won six individ

ual events, two of them by John
Hudson, who posted a 1:49.3 in
the 200-vard freestyle and a 4:51.8
in the 500-yard freestyle. Fresh
man Chip Hoke won the 1000
yard freestyle in 10:40.57 (the

second best time in the
year behind Hudson)

The 1975 Generals suffered
through a 1-8-1 campaign, defeat-
ing Georgetown, 28-26, in the final
game to end the season on a
happy note.

McHenry described Perry as
“the finest receiver in W&L’s
modern history,” and Slatcoff as
“the best linebacker I’ve ever
coached,”

A starter since his freshman
year, Perry has already broken
two pass-receiving records and is
within an eyelash of another. His
career records include most TD
receptions (13) and most total
yards (1557). With 123 catches,
he needs just five more next year
to become the all-time receiver
in W&L history.

Richmond to meet Virginia Com
monwealth at 4:00 p.m. They

Dennis brought the Generals back
with two straight baskets and
Baum followed with two more to
tie the score at 27-27 with 8:10
remaining.

W&L went through a moment-
ary defensive lapse, however, and
the Haven beat them under the
boards to regain their lead. The
rest of the half was a seesaw
battle as the lead changed back
and forth five times. The Generals
got the lead of a Baum jump
shot at 39-37 with one minute
and six seconds left on the clock.
Lock Haven tied it at 39-39 with
54 seconds before LSS guard Bill
Vassallo connected for two points
with 18 seconds to send the Gen-
erals to the locker room trailing
41-39.

“The Haven” outshot W&L in
the first half on free throws hit-
ting seven out of seven attempts
while the Generals shot a measly
3-9. The Generals trailed 58.6 to
40.6 per cent from the field.

W&L did not waste any time
at the start of the second half
reeling off seven straight points

before LHS could score. This
gave them a 46-41 lead with 16:50

remaining.

From then on, W&L never tail-
ed, compiling as much as an 11
pont lead at the eight minute
mark. But then “The Haven”
started coming back.

The Generals’ lead fell to three
points at 71-68 with two minutes
left. After going into a stall-
offense with a minute left, Leunig
turned the ball over when he
threw it out of bounds. W&L went
into a full-court press but could

not stop Vassallo from scoring
with twenty seconds left to nar-
row the lead to one point.

Podgajny was fouled with seven
seconds showing on the clock,
however, and the Generals’ cap-
tain converted both free throws
to secure the W&L lead. Lock
liaven had the ball long enough
afterwards to miss two field goal
attempts before the buzzer sound-
ed giving the Generals a 73-70
win.

Podgajny led the Generals in

eee

 

scoring with 24 points followed
by Leunig (11), Baum (10), Berlin
(7) and Dennis (7). Flint and
Baum led in the rebound depart-
ment with 8 apiece. Flint was also
the Generals’ leader in steals com-
ing up with five of the team’s 10
total.

Washington and Lee had
another fight-to-the-finish Satur-

day night in the championship
game of the tournament against
the Lycoming College Warriors.

Four hundred cheering W&L
fans watched the contest in which
the Generals escaped with another
narrow victory, 78-75. W&L won
the tipoff but trailed in point
totals most of the first half. Ly-
coming’s brother combination of
Jim and John DiMarco and Bill
Conroy were pesky for the Gen-
erals the entire night. John Di-
Marco, who was later selected as
one of the tournament’s all-star
guards along with John Podgajny,
got Lycoming its first lead two
minutes into the game.

After that Lycoming led most
of the first half except for a
momentary W&L lead at 19-18
with 7:45 remaining. Bob Flint
kept the Generals alive hitting 11
first-half points and grabbing five
rebounds off the boards. Chris
Larson tied the game with two
free throws at 30-30 with five sec-
onds left. Baum was fouled with
five seconds left but failed to
connect and the teams went to
intermission deadlocked with a
30-30 tie.

The second half started slowly
for the Generals but Don Berlin
started a rally with 16:58 left to

play that eventually gave them
a 47-40 lead. Berlin hit six
straight points for the Generals
and assisted on two more as W&L
turned the game arund. John
Podgajny, after a slow first half,
started connecting on his famous
jump shot and the Generals were
on the move.

Lycoming tried to stop W&L
by applying a man-to-man press
with ten minutes remaining. In
the process, Ray Riggins, one of
their leading scorers, fouled out
of the game. The Generals’ lead
fell to 52-51 with 10:19 left.
Another close finish was in the
making as Lycoming tied it at
57-57 with 7:50 and 61-61 with
6:13 remaining to play.

Podgajny and Flint proved too
much to handle for the Warriors
as they both hit shots under pres-
sure to keep the Generals’ lead
the rest of the game. Podgajny
again led in scoring with 22
points to give W&L a 78-75 win.
Flint finished close behind with
19 points and 9 rebounds to lead
in that department for W&L. Both
Flint and Podgajny were selected
as tournament all-stars and Wash-
ington and Lee, of course, won
the tournament.

The two wins, added to the 72-
67 victory over Bridgewater Col-
lege January 7, now gives the
Generals an impressive 6-3 record
and a four game winning streak.
The Generals traveled to Emory
and Henry College yesterday
(Jan. 14) and will face Virginia
Wesleyan at home Saturday at
8:30 p.m.

Wrestlers handed first upset

Duke handed Washington and

Pratt believed in education; established many research programs

(Continued from page 2)
Pont was subsequently made to
get rid of its GM holdings, at-
torneys on both sides were amaz-
ed at Pratt’s memory for detail.

Pratt never forgot his origins
on a King George County farm,
and he retained a love for the
soil all his life. When he pur-
chased Chatham and along with
it several other farms in Stafford
and King George, he decided to
sell the farms only to young men
who were interested in being full-
time farmers. He stuck to that
decision though he could have
gotten much more money from
the farms by selling them to
others who would not have farm-
ed them full time or would have
developed them for other pur-
poses,

Pratt’s interests were many and
diverse. Over a period of years
he provided, anonymously, schol-
arship funds of major importance
in a number of Virginia colleges
and universities and made a num-
ber of important contributions to
Johns Hopkins University in
Baltimore, which he served as
a trustee for many years. He also
gave scholarship funds to the
Virginia Museum of Fine Arts.

He took a particular interest in
research at universities and con-
tributed generously to such re-
search. When doing so he _ in-
variably gave an extra measure to
support added expenses involved

penses.

(In a 1958 letter to Dr. Gaines,
just after Washington and Lee an-
nounced its program to strengthen
facilities and programs in the
sciences, Mr. Pratt wrote: “It is
pleasing to me to see that you
are going to attempt to improve
the accommodations at Washing-

ton and Lee for the sciences.
When Russia launched their
Sputniks, they did one of the

best things for America that even
a good friend could have done:
namely, awakening us to the poor
job being done on sciences in
American schools.”’)

Pratt always believed that mem-
bers of college faculties should
be paid well for what they did,
and rather than donate money
for buildings (since it was his
theory that funds for new build-
ings were relatively easy to raise)
Pratt established funds to pay
faculty members more.

A civil engineer himself, he
often remarked he met few engi-
neers who could write a good
letter, and to help remedy that
he personally established a chair
of English in the Department of
Engineering at the University of
Virginia.

An entirely new research effort
at Johns Hopkins University had
its origins when some cattle on a
farm owned by Pratt died myst-
eriously. For several weeks he
called in exeprts who tried in

vain to discover the reason for
the deaths.

Then a cattleman who had once
farmed in Texas told Pratt the

with research efforts since, to the
delight of college administrators,
he realized that extra activity
usually generated additional ex-

Gift ‘overwhelms’ Nuckols;
Huntley terms it ‘magnificent’

(Continued from page 1)
the following remarks:

“Needless to say, I’m just delighted to hear of the gift, and as
President Huntley said to the New York Times, we are overwhelmed
and almost speechless. All weekend I have been walking around
almost floating on air—it’s just a marvelous gift and a great help
to Washington and Lee, coming at such an opportune moment.

“This is such a great boost for the Development Program. I
think it is just wonderful that Mr. Pratt would do something like
this for all the colleges involved, and particularly for private insti-
tutions, which are in such need of this type of support.

“The Board of Trustees—and the whole W&L community, for
that matter, faculty and students—are very, very grateful.”

In a comment on Mr. Pratt and on the significance of his gift
to Washington and Lee, President Robert E. R. Huntley said:

“Colleges sometimes overuse such words as ‘great’ and ‘mag-
nificent’—but I think it is objectively fair by any measure to say
that those words perhaps understate the impact of John Lee Pratt's
bequest to Washington and Lee University.

“In the same way,” Huntley said, ‘I do not think w> can over-
estimate what it has meant to us to have had his friendship, per-
sonally and institutionally—nor what it has meant to us to have
received his enthusiastic endorsement of our character, our strengths,
and our aspirations.

“Mr. Pratt was a businessman of legendary acumen; he created
his estate by means of his own talents and his own abiiities and
his own uncanny powers of judgment. And drawing on vio e formid-
able resources, Mr. Pratt judged Washington and Lee Univers.(:
and found us worthy.

“That knowledge, reflected as it is in his overwhelming benefac-
tion, is what fills our hearts and gratifies us now.

“While this gift is magnificent—and goes a long, long way
toward helping us achieve the formidable development goals we
defined as crucial some years ago—ihere remain a number o ‘sub
stantial unmet needs at Washington and Lee, the achievemeat of
which has long been imperative and remains so. It is to these press-
ing necessities that we can and must now turn our full attention.”

disease could be cleared up by
adding a tiny bit of cobalt—a
trace element—to the diet of the
COWS.

Pratt tried it and it worked
That led him to an interest in
the importance of trace elements
—or “micronutrients,” as they
are more formally called—and in
1947 he donated funds to estab-
lish the MeCollum-Pratt Institute
at Johns Hopkins for studies in
that field. McCollum was E. V.
MeCollum, a pioneer in the field
of the study of vitamins. The
institute continues today, and has
issued reports of worldwide im-
portance on micronutrients.

Although Pratt and his wife
formed a foundation, it has con-
centrated mainly on area and
Virginia philanthropies. Pratt
served on the boards of several
larger foundations over a period
of years and at one time consider-
ed establishing a large foundation
himself,

But as time went by he be-
came disillusioned with large
foundations in general, reaching
a personal conclusion that it was
wrong to perpetuate great for-
tunes long after the person who
acquired the fortune was gone.
He felt it would probably be bet-
ter to seatter such fortunes on
the death of whoever had ac-
quired them, and he took pains to
make certain the wealth he had
acquired would not be self-per-
petuating.

His worth was estimated by
Fortune magazine in the mid-
1950’s at between $100 and $200
million, but Pratt never bothered
to comment on such speculation.

Pratt’s interest in General
Motors extended to every phase
of the company’s operation. He
often spent part of the winter in
Arizona and had many friends on
the faculty of the University of
Arizona.

When he noticed that some of
his faculty friends were driving
small foreign cars, Pratt asked
them why. They responded that
the smaller cars were more eco-

nomical and were also well made.
Convinced, Pratt was among the
first to urge General Motors to
get into the small-car production.

One of Pratt’s intimate friends
was Gen. George C. Marshall,
Army chief of staff during World
War II and later Secretary of
State. Marshall and Pratt some-
times exchanged visits at each

other’s homes. Pratt helped fi-
nance the George C. Marshall

Library at Virginia Military Insti-
tute.

Willis, who handled the negotia-
tions with the performers for
S.A.B.U. said he was unaware
that such close contact should be
maintained with the E.C, about
the use of the funds.

According to Willis, the first
contact with Baraka came dur-
ing exams and the deal was not
concluded until the end of last
week,

“IT don't know what could have
been done,” he said.

The appearance of Baraka,

in part by $250 contributed by
