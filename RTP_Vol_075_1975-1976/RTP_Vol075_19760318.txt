Solons reverse decision
on senior law franchise

By JOE FITZGERALD

In a special hour-long meeting
Tuesday afternoon the Executive
Committee voted 6-5 to allow
third-year law students to vote in
next year’s election.

The vote followed a 9-1-1 deci-
sion the night before to disen-
franchise the seniors in Tucker
Hall. Tuesday’s vote allows the
seniors to cast ballots Monday for
the student who will represent the
law school on the E. C. during
next Fall’s budget hearings and
this Spring’s committee selection.

The matter of seniors voting was
brought up before Monday’s E.C.
meeting by Channing Martin,
freshman law representative to
the E.C. and candidate in the up-
coming election for upperclass
law school representative.

Dave Cranshaw, one of Martin's
opponents in the campaign, ac-
cused Martin Tuesday of a “con-
flict of interests” in bringing up
the issue during the race. Accord-
ing to E.C. president Leland Me-
Cullough, allowing the third year
students to vote would “do in”
Martin’s campaign.

Martin cited his “duty” to clear
up the discrepancy between vot-
ing rights in the senior classes of
the law  and_ undergraduate
schools. He said the issue was
brought up during the campaign
because that is the only time any-
one thinks about election rules.

Martin was against letting the

seniors vote in both meetings.
Senior law representative Clendon
Lee was the only one opposed to
the disenfranchisement in the first
vote. He was joined on Tuesday
by McCullough, Sandy Stradtman,
Bobby Pugh, Billy Webster, and
Jim Underhill, all of whom were
originally against the seniors vot-
ing (except Webster, who abstain-
cd from Monday’s vote).

Before Tuesday’s vote law stu-
dent Hal Clarke presented a peti-
tion bearing the names of 135 law
students who wanted the issue
decided by a referendum in the
law school before the election.

Clarke cited the fact that even
though the student body constitu-
tion gives the E.C. the power to
decide the rules of all E.C. elec-
tions, the E.C. has given the law
school the right to govern its own
elections in the past. According to
Clarke, “The E.C. is going out of
its way, without really recogniz-
ing it, to antagonize the law
school.”

Tom Sansonetti, president of
the Student Bar Association, also
mentioned the E.C. right to de-
cide election issues, but added,
“They should not shirk that duty.”

E.C, junior representative Scott
Franklin agreed, calling the inde-
cision on the part of the E.C.
“poor.”

Radar Davis, the other jr. rep.,
said that many undergraduate sen-
iors assumed that they could not

vote in class elections. Sr. rep.
Bill Garrison also cited the diff-
erence between at-large elections
for Big Three seats and class elec-
tions for representatives and of-
ficers.

Clarke answered that the repre-
sentative for the upperclass law
students is closer to the Big Three
elections in concept than to the
class elections.

Pugh, in making the motion that
the E.C. reverse its decision of
Monday night, said that the E.C.
had thought the issue was “low-
key” when the original vote was
taken. He said that considering
the issues of personality involved,
the E.C. should let tradition stand
for the duration of the present
campaign and make a permanent
decision on the matter after the
election.

Students depict Founding Fathers

By GRAY COLEMAN

The University Theatre’s pro-
duction of 1776 by Peter Stone
and Sherman Edwards is schedul-
ed to open next week for a three-
night run (Friday, March 26 thru
Sunday, March 20) in Evans Din-
ing Hall.

Dr. Al Gordon is directing the

ADCO posts record profits for year;
“management” pleased with simulation

By the News Staff

“Advanced Communications,
Inc., has announced record earn-
ings for its fiscal year just ended.
Net income jumped to $200,000
from the $5000 of the previous
year. Return on investment leap-
ed from 1% to over 16%, a ratio
thre times the industry average.”

ADCO, as its management likes
the company to be called, does
not really exist on the open mar-
ketplace. But it has been a quite
real corporation to five commerce
students for the past six weeks.
Those students participated in the
Emory Business Game, a comput-
er-simulated program that allows
students to conduct a “business”
in competition with students in
other coleges.

This year’s team finished the
program in second place in their
division, which included Wake
Forest, University of Baltimore,
University of Dayton, W&M and
VPI. Wake Forest placed first,
and went on to take the national
competition,

The students, John Swanson,
Mynders Glover, Phil Hanrahan,
Jay duRivage, and Mark Maurais,
were quite pleased with the final
results. After a slow start in the
wame, the team managed to man-
euver their company into a posi-
tion (o take full advantage of
some market conditions that other
colleges did not anticipate.

and Member of The Center for

sity of Virginia, will deliver the

What really helped the crew
though, was their formal presenta-
tion (a sort of Stockholders’ Meet-
ing) in the final get-together in
Atlanta. Thirty percent of the
rating given to each team by the
judges is determined by the pre-
sentation, and the W&L group
picked up 27 points here.” “The
team did quite well in handling
the report,” commented the fac-
ulty advisor to the group, Dr.
Joseph Goldsten.

Members of ADCO’s “board of
directors” feel that W&L’s strong
showing provided graphic evi-
dence of the strength inherent in
the W&L business program. “We
were fortunate to represent W&L
——we learned first-hand the true
value of a W&L education,” said
Glover.

While many teams stumbled

when questioned by the judges on
various points about their firms,
the W&L students were quick to
present the correct figures and ex-
plain their significance .

On a seale of 100, W&L receiv-
ed a total of 70.5 points, compar-
ed to Wake Forest’s 73.5. W&L's
bad start in the three-year simula-
tion hurt them, but the fact that
they pulled through in the third
year, plus their expertise in the
presentations, gave them some
favor with the judging panel,
which included Emory professors,
acountants, bankers and corporate
executives.

Other colleges and universities
which compete in the annual pro-
gram include Auburn, Rensselaer
Polytech, Georgia Tech, Vander-
bilt, VCU, and about two dozen
others.

show, with assistance from music
director Dr. Gordon Spice. The
dining hall was chosen as the set
for its large seating capacity and
appropriate decor. The congres-
sional chamber, designed by Wal-
ter Romanchuk, blends with its
surroundings to a great degree,
and utilizes many period pieces,
such as quill pens, inkwells, bam-
hoo fly-swaters, and so forth.

Briefly, the plot revolves around
the actions of the Continental
Congress in the summer months of
1776, up to the signing of Declara-
tion of Independence. The pivotal
character in the movement for
freedom is John Adams of Massa-
chussets (played by Rob Mish).
With the aid of some well known
historical figures like Benjamin
Franklin (Chuck Harer), Thomas
Jefferson (Dan Westbrook), and
Richard Henry Lee (Dan Scott),
he succeeds in overcoming his
main opponents, John Dickinson
of Pennsylvania (Lecky Stone),
and Edward Rutledge of South
Carolina (Mike Armstrong).

Upon seeing the play, a large
number of people may wonder if
our country really got started in
such a way. In the words of the

authors, “The answer is yes. Cer-
tainly a few basic changes have
been made in order to fulfill basic
dramatic tenets . . . Reality is sel-
dom artistic, orderly, or dramatic-
ally satisfying. Therefore, in his-
torical drama, a number of small
licenses are almost always taken
with the strictest fact.”

Indeed, audiences should notice
that aside from the “great names”
of the Congress, there were other
heroes, not necessarily any small-
er in stature at that time, from
the truly admirable patriot, Cae-
sar Rodney (Stewart Barroll) to the
cautious James Wilson (Charles
Smith), whose last-minute conver-
sion changes the entire Congres-
sional outlook. And, finally, the
perpetual dispatches of General
George Washington, somewhere
out on the battlefields, serve to
show the emotions of those out-
side the Congress who desperate-
ly need their help.

Reservations are nevessary for
the show, and the box ofifce 1s
presently open. For seats, call the
University Theatre at 463-9111,
ext. 273. All seats for members ot
the W&L community are compli-
mentary.

Is Udall the new McGovern?

By PHILIP HATCHETT

At a quick glance it would seem
that Representative Morris Udall
of Arizona is all set to blast off for
the Democratic nomination. As
the campaign moved through
three major primaries, Udall
emerged as the only liberal candi-
date remaining among the five
major contenders, It’s Udall ver-
sus the  never-to-be-nominated
George Wallace, love's candidate
Jimmy Carter, the always bor-
ing Henry Jackson and sideliner
Hubert Humphrey.

Udall was the first announced
candidate for President back in
1974. With his hat in the ring
came a media bombardment of
doomed failure and skepticism.
The print claimed that his name
was not known, and his present
job (member of the House of
Representatives) was not prestigi-
ous enough to warrant voter ac-
ceptance

But since '74 Mo Udall has seen
three of the appealing liberal
candidates rise and fall on the
stomp. Shriver, Bayh and Harris,
all with bigger names and more
recognition for previous actions,
have failed to politically surface
and even take 10% of the vote
in any primary, Now their cam
paigns are bankrupt and washed
up

However Udall has shown voter
appeal, getting 24° of the vote
in conservative New Hampshire
and taking a second place to
Carter. In Massachusetts, another
red-ribbon finish was registered
with 1814 of the vote compared to
Jackson's 24%

But the Udall campaign still
appears lost somewhere between
success and failure. Instead of
standings tall like a General after
fending off the enemy, Udall looks

more like a foot-soldier suffering
and hungry and thanking God for
preserving him to starve and
suffer a little longer. Udall may
be winning some battles but he is
still losing the war of financing.
He is the poorest of the active
campaigners. The Udall for Presi-
dent Committee reports they are
about $100,000 in the hole and
that does not count all the bills
in Massachusetts. At every stop
on the campaign trail, it’s the
speech first and then the drive
for cash.

The natural tendency for politi-
cal observers is to compare the
“Udall in '76" campaign to the
McGovern movement in '72—both
share similar views, a lack of
money and even campaign per-
sonnel. Both have similar quixotic
campaign styles, which gained the
acceptance of the young in "72
and will likely repeat itself this
year.

However the analogy falls apart
on the issues: MeGovern had one,
Udall does not. The MeGovern
“eause” was to end the War in
Vietnam. Udall does not have a
war—just the three “Es”, the
Economy, Environment and En-
ergy. This shallow stance basic
ally defines him the “liberal” and
nothing more, nothing less.

This week even the word “lib
eral” was lost when he started
calling himself “progressive” in
honor of the Wisconsin primary

Where the Udall Campaign has
gotten most of its headlines from
is denunciations, especially of
Gov. Wallace. In October of ‘75
when speaking in Lee Chapel,
we heard him joking about going
to Alabama without his passport,
one of his favorite stomping stor
ies. This attitude served to capture

the intelligentsia vote (but not
their money) of the North and
an equally impressive 2% of the
vote in Florida. Although the
South is not backing Wallace, it
will not look favorably on a candi-
date whose negativism towards
the Governor bleeds into a gen-
eral depressive reaction for the
whole South, “Listening to him
(Udall) makes you fell like living
in the South is a liability and
not an asset,” said one Virginia
legislator last month.

Any effect Wallace has in New
York come July will definitely
work against Udall. What delegate
loyal to Wallace wil lgo to Udall

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
Thursday, March 18, 1976

Who should pay?

The sophomore class settled out of court with the band
that was suing the class for damages allegedly done to its
equipment and van during the Homecoming Grain Party.
The band sought $2000 in reparation ; they are receiving $500.
The question was raised in several recent E.C, meetings as
to who should pay for the settlement: the sophomore class,
all classes together, or the E.C.?

Students buy from their officers class passes which allow
them entrance to all grain parties. Tickets, which can be
purchased by anyone, are normally sold at the “door” for
these functions. Therefore, members of any class could have
perpetrated the “damage.”

Just because the sophomore class threw the Homecoming
party does not make them more liable than other classes for
the damage. An incident of this sort could just as easily occur
at Fancy Dress or Springs. Essentially, when one purchases
a class pass one is supporting all four classes and their parties ;
each class throws a party to which other class members
bearing passes are admitted; each class reciprocates.

The possibility of the Executive Committee paying for
the settlement should not even be discussed. The student
activities fee, on which the E.C, runs its budget, is mandatory.
Class dues, on which parties are thrown and savings funds
accumulated, are not mandatory, It is then obvious that these
class funds, and not general student funds, should be used
in this case, and we feel that the E.C. was wise in not agree-
ing to pay.

Class officers have to sign band contracts in the name of
their own class, but they are assuming responsibility not only
for the actions of their classmates, but of all members of the
University. Is it fair to burden them, and the finances of their
class, with damages that cannot be traced to any individuals?

We think not. Rather than acting in the name of their
class, officers are acting in the name of all who attend these
parties, of all classes. It is therefore our opinion that all
classes should share in any extraordinary charges arising from
these parties, and we hope that in a spirit of co-operation all
class officers will agree to spread the cost of the case among
the four undergradute classes.

—S.C.Y.

Our economic impact

Since our comments on this page last week concerning the
financial involvement of Washington and Lee in Lexington
were made, we have come upon some data to support our
conjecture that W&L is indeed a significant element in the
economy of the area.

According to a study conducted in 1974 by members of
the University, a study which took more than a year to
complete and was quite comprehensive, W&L was shown to
he responsible for more than 25% of the money spent in
Lexington, or $8 million out of an economy that was then
operating at an annual level of spending of $31.4 million. An
interesting fact to note is that for the year studied, the budget
for the University was about $6 million, the inference being
that for every $1 that W&L spends, Lexington pockets $1.33.
(The ripple effect of re-spending, as every student of eco-
nomics knows, accounts for the difference.)

Quoting from the report: “The analysis does not show the
political, social, or aesthetic impacts on the City of Lexington,
There is no way to measure the uncompensated services
\Iso
unmeasurable is the dimension added to Lexington because

rendered by University personnel to the community . . .

of the cultural events, athletic events, social events .. .” It
should also be stressed that the figures used in the study are
dated, and any current assessment of the situation might re-
veal a different level of influence, Also, it should be noted that
the study only dealt with the impact of W&L on Lexington,
and did not inelude data for the county,

WA&L is not the be-all-and-end-all for Lexington and its
residents, as many of them are quick to point out, It does
appear from the study that this University is one of the
largest, if not in fact the largest, “industry” in the city-county,
We hope that students do not dwell on this fact, but that
members of the community do, so that relations between
the two can be smoothed out.

The boys on the E.C.

“Money well spent.”

With that remark exit an Executive Committee member
from the University Theatre following one of three perfor-
mances of the play, The Boys in the Band.

Last month the I.C., after a lengthy and often ridiculous
debate, voted to allocate $50 to finance the production. The
play cost $80. The producer, Brian Garr, is paying for the bal-
ance. The Fine Arts department did no more than donate the
building for several days—all props were solicited from friends
and acquaintances,

Considering the conditions under which they worked, the
cast did an excellent job in presenting material that was not
quite so controversial as some individuals made it out to be.
The more progressive and open-minded members of the E.C.
should be lauded for attending performances to see what
all the furor was about, (All who saw it seemed quite im-
pressed.) Those who voted against funding the play and then
viewed the production should be lauded for having the
intestinal fortitude to attend and afterwards admit that
perhaps they had been wrong.

Those of the E.C. who abstained from the Theatre, well...

Those that did not attend will be pleased to discover that
the theatre season for next year includes a flashy superficial
Neil Simon production, and for those who wish to see a
production of Arsenic and Old Lace, don't give up—your wish
may yet come true,

Amazing

Someone who is not running for student office definitely
needs to say something about the “amazing” number of people
seeking positions of power and responsibility this week, Bill
Kerr contributed the quoted adjective there, and as head
of the Voting Regulations Board, he is supposed to know
quite a lot about elections. He knows so much that after
considering the matter for awhile he decided he would have
to print up a two-page ballot. With that thought in mind he
amended his carlier statment to read “amazing zoo,”

A lot of people have said a lot of things in recent memory
about some vague demon called “student apathy.” Apparently
this formless devil is not with us this month, Last week almost
1000 students voted in the Big Three elections and this week
there are no fewer than 50 persons running for various offices,
This number was reduced from a higher sum by the six or
so candidates who were expected to run for senior E.C, spots
but did not. Possibly they were seared away by the six who
did decide to run for those two seats.

“Seared” may become a catchword in the campaign. It will
certainly be enough to make the stouthearted tremble just a
bit to see this bludgeoning army of hopefuls hitting the
campaign trail, wherever that is. One observer at Monday's
k.C, meeting, when asked what he was running for, gazed
around for a moment at the mass of budding politicians filling
the chairs, the floor, the rafters and one another's shoulders,

and replied, “The border,”

»
3.5 for 32 in 48...

we

By J. G. FITZGERALD during the opening session.

Paraphernalia

Once more, to clear the air, the
title of this column is not a
whimsical item plucked from the
air to give students something to
speculate about in the midst of
an astounding drunk. The title
“3.5 for 32 in 48..." means that
the Mock Convention goes througa
three and a half years of planning
to spend $32,000 in 48 hours.

Actually not all of that money
will be spent in the two days in
May when the deal actually comes
down, but MC treasurer Bob
Ballenger says that possibly as
much as 40-50% of it will, mostly
on phones for the delegates’ use
in finding out what is going on
out there in the real world. And
not all of it will even be spent
this year. Each MC tries to leave
a little bit of cash in reserve for
the next effort and this year's
steering committee is hoping to
leave about five or six grand for
MC ‘80,

The money that is not spent on
phones or the 1980 convention is
going toward such projects as
bringing in $1000 speakers to
deaden the spirits of the delegates
and prevent the kind of frenzy
that broke out in ‘72.

And just to make gure the
delegates do not get too dulled
by the politics of the thing, the
MC will feature the lovely and
talented Miss Virginia, who will
remind the delegates of the great
responsibility laying before them
by singing the National Anthem

Money is also being spent on
various printing jobs. Last week
the first issue of the “Mock Con-
vention Swing.” a regular up-
date on various MC projects, was
produced. Also appearing was a
new flier running through such
things as the schedule for the
MC, the speakers who will be
here, the record of the MC, and
last but not least, the kind words
David Brudnoy had to say about
the whole deal in his column, If
nothing else, the flier, which folds
out into six sections, will make a
great poster for the souvenir-
conscious when the whole thing
is over.

And for those who do not like
posters with a lot of print on
them, the Mock Convention is
planning a somewhat simplified
poster for people who would
rather look than read. The poster
is expected to look something like
the cover of the MC Journal, so
as to give onlookers a frame of
reference. It is one of many
money-raising projects that will
be coming in these final eight
weeks before the convention.

Since all Journal ads were due
in four days ago, all money the
states bring in now will have to
come from donations and sales
of various MC  paraphrenalia.
Money will also be brought in by
raffles. The Illinois delegation was

Q—Are there any ghosts in Lexington?

A—Yes, although many of them prefer to remain anonymous for tax
purposes. As you may recall, the town of Lexington was originally
layed out back in the days when a belief in the supernatural was
as socially acceptable as is placing an obscene phone call in the
Jerry Lewis Telethon today. Consequently, all the fashionable
eighteenth century families in Lexington invited local representa-
tives of the demon’s club to their social gatherings, though hob-
goblins were notoriously poor charades players and often threw
loud tantrums upon missing a clue. Gradually, this practice died
out when whist came into favor.

Here, today, in the many antebellum houses around town, an-
cestral ghosts quietly haunt their former homes, and are regarded
by their living descendents with filial pride and affection, although
occassional family disputes arise over who gets the bathroom first
in the morning. These phantoms are as much a part of the house-
hold as the antique furniture and will often balance centerpieces
and candlesticks on their heads for great lengths of time to fool

dinner guests. Indeed,

these family spooks have enlivened

many a dull alumni party with their incorporeal antics, eccentric
behavior, and an uncanny ability to win at Scrabble.

Of course, the many ghosts of Lexington do not limit their
nocturnal activities to old houses alone. Some roam the back
streets looking for odd jobs, while the more adventuresome ones
will go around ringing doorbells and then, after posing as a
social worker, vanish suddenly before the eyes of horrified resi-
dents who have just agreed to support a starving Korean family
for $1 a month and all the back issues of Esquire they can read.
At the Southern Inn, the waitress reports a misty fellow appearing
each Thursday to order the businessman’s special only to dis-
appear before the Jello is served. “He’s probably embarrassed,”
conjectured the waitress. “I notice he seems to have trouble pick-
ing up his silverware and folding his napkin.” This is thought to
be the ghost of Hawg Sorrels, late postmaster of Lexington, who
was found dead one morning inside a registered package of
lasagna on its way, air express, to Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.
Foul play was ruled out because the package had the correct

postage on it.

Q—What do you say to a ghost, if you meet one?

A—Oh, talk about the weather, or sports, general things. For heavens
sake, though stay away from Dickens. Ghosts hate Dickens. He
never gave them any speaking parts, you know.

Q—How do you get rid of a ghost?

A—-Offer him seconds on Jello.

Automobile registration reminder

All students who have motor
vehicles at Washington and Lee
and who purchased local tags in
March or April of 1975 are re-
minded of the requirement to
purchase new tags prior to the
expiration of the ones currently
displayed.

A student whose local address
is within the city limits of Lex-
ington is required to purchase a
decal from the City Treasurer’s
Office at the Lexington City Hall
on East Washington Street. These
decals, which cost $10.00 each,
are good for a twelve month
period from the date of purchase.
A student whose local residence
is in Rockbridge County is to pur-
chase his decal at the County

es,

laudable, but one has to wonder
what would happen if every one
of the fifty delegations decided
to hold a raffle and each one
decided to give away a gallon of
grain for the prize. Think of the
money it would save the junior

From the
White Book

“...(A)ny work handed in for
credit toward a grade will be con-
sidered pledged unless specific-
ally stated otherwise. In any case
of doubts as to the extent of a
pledge, the student should im-
mediately request that the pro-
fessor in charge make the re-
quirements perfectly clear to the

A student’s obligation to the
Honor System in academic mat-
ters is to do his own work unless
the professor states otherwise. As
stated in an earlier selection, the
main purpose which a_ pledge
serves is te remind a student of
his obligation to the Honor Sy.-
tem. Although each professor has
an obligation to make clear his
expectations concerning pledged
work, each student has the re-
sponsibility to understand those
expectations for every assignment.

The E.C. encourages any stu-
dent who has a question about
the Honor System to contact an
E.C. member who will try to

Baseball Generals opened season Tarheels could be tough

with weekend double-header win

By SAMMY THOMPSON

Junior Dan Westbrook pitched
a 3-hit shutout in the first game
and freshman Rich Wiles drove in
the winning run in the second
game to lead Washington and
Lee’s Baseball team to a double-
header win over West Virginia
Tech last Sunday.

The Generals won the first
game, 7-0, and the second, 5-4.

Westbrook, returning from last
year’s pitching staff, had little
trouble with Tech, striking out
10 and giving up only three hits.

The Generals’ offense came up

with five hits and seven walks
while the West Virginia defense

Track members
take first places

Junior Paul Thomson and fresh-
man Phil Dunlay were individual
champions as W&L placed a
strong fifth in the fourth annual
Virginia College Athletic Associa-
tion (VCAA) indoor track meet.

Thomson won the 880-yard run
with a 2:02.2 clocking, while Dun-
lay won the 35-lb. weight throw
with a distance of 53-1.

Madison won the VCAA champ-
ionship with a total of 67 points
followed by Virginia State and
Hampton Institute with 45 each,
Emory and Henry 24, W&L 22,
Lynchburg 18, Bridgewater 15
and Roanoke 2.

Law III leads

in intramurals

With five sports counted, tennis,
golf, football, swimming and the
turkey trot, Law 3 has taken a
55-point lead in the intramural
standings this year. Phi Kappa
Sigma is second followed by Pi
Kappa Alpha, Phi Kappa Psi and
Sigma Chi.

Lambda Chi Alpha recently
won the ping-pong championship
ahead of PKA, ZBT and DTD.
Phi Kappa Psi won the bowling
title ahead of PKA also.

In the wrestling tournament,
held several weeks ago, Phi
Kappa Sigma won the last match
of the night to deadlock with
Sigma Chi for the championship.
Instead of replaying the match to
determine a champion, the two
teams wil split the first place
points.

committed five errors.

Sophomore Ted Hissey drove
in the first W&L run with a triple
and that, as it turned out, was all
the Generals needed for the vic-
tory.

In the second game, however,
W&L had to play catch-up ball.
West Va. Tech took a 1-0 lead in
the fourth inning and maintain-
ed it at 4-3 going into the bottom
of the 6th. Wild pitching and a
single by Wiles allowed W&L to
go ahead for the first time.

Freshman Bruce Williams re-
placed Mike Rhodes on the mound
and saved the win for the Gen-
erals.

Senior Tommy Hudgins was in-

jured in the game when he was
hit in the head with the ball after
he stole third base. He will prob-
ably miss the next three weeks
of play.

Head coach Joe Lyles was
pleased with the wins and compli-
mented on the team’s sound play.

Last year, W&L had a tough
season with several injuries and
five cancelled games. The Gen-
erals ended up with a 3-19 record.

Today, W&L plays Providence
College of Rhode Island here at
3 p.m. This weekend, the Generals
travel to Newport News and Nor-
folk for two doubleheaders against
Apprentice College and Old
Dominion.

One of the first crucial tests
of the young lacrosse season
comes Saturday on Wilson Field
when the Generals host North
Carolina’s powerful Tarheels.

North Carolina proved it is one
of the nation’s top teams Monday
by taking defending national
champion Maryland into overtime
before dropping a 12-10 decision.

Both teams figure to be high
in the national rankings when
the polls come out next week.
W&L has not been severely tested
from a college opponent, follow-
ing romps over N.C. State (20-3),
Duke (19-8) and Morgan State (18-
3).

W&L and UNC figure to present
quite a contrast on the field.
W&L’s strength lies in its high-
scoring attack and strong de-
fense, while North Carolina’s
forte is a very talented midfield.

High expectations for swimmers

W&L will send probably its
strongest team in history to the
NCAA Division If national
swimming championships _ this
weekend in Washington, Pa.

The seven-member team is led
by five-time All-American John
Hudson, and_ three-time  All-
American Tad Van Leer. Hudson
could become W&L’s first na-
tional champion, since he has the
best time in the nation in two
events and will be the early
favorite.

Hampered in recent weeks by
a viral infection, Hudson hopes to
be fully recovered in time for the
opening events today at Wash-
ington and Jefferson College. The
national meet will continue at the
Pennsylvania school through Sat.

Hudson will swim in the 200-,
500- and 1650-yard freestyle
events, plus the 400- and 800-
yard relays. Van Leer, who also
has been fighting a recent ill-
ness, will swim in the 50- and
100-yard freestyles, the 100-yard
butterfly and the 400-yard relay.

Diver Bill Cogar, the state
champion in both the 1-meter and
3-meter events, is expected to

“They have about eight very
good athletes on their midfield,”
commented W&L coach Jack
Emmer. “Somehow we will have
to negate their midfield strength.
They are good on defense and
their attack is solid, but we think
we can handle it with our de-
fense.”

The W&L defense _ features
goalie Charlie Brown, who _ is
averaging over 15 saves a game,
All-American Tom Keigler and
Rob Lindsey, and John Strock on
the crease. The offense is led by
attackman Don Carroll, who has
six goals and 11 assists; mid-
fielder Jack Dudley (11 goals,
three assists) and attackman Rob
Morgan (six goals, six assists).
Morgan scored three goals in
Saturday’s 11-8 exhibition loss to
Mt. Washington.

In last week’s action, W&L
avenged last year’s upset by
Morgan State, and played well be-
fore losing at Mt. Washington.
Coach Emmer said he was “pleas-
ed with the result against Morgan
State, but we could play a lot
better, and we’ll have to, to win
the big games.”

The W&L coach also was
pleased with the showing against
Mt. Washington, who, he says,
“could very well be the best

lacrosse team in the country, col-
lege or club.” The Generals led
by an early 1-0 score on a goal
by Charlie Stieff, fell behind 4-1,
then tied it on three straight
goals by Morgan.

Mt. Washington, controlling
the ball, led the rest of the way,
but the Generals closed to 9-7
with three minutes to go and miss-
ed a one-on-one shot at the Mt.
Washington goalie. The Mount’s
Skip Lichtfuss, one of a half dozen
former W&L stars now playing
for Mt. Washington’s defending
national club champions, then
scored the clinching goal.

“Our overall defense, both in
the midfield and in close, played
very well the second half,” Emmer
noted, and limited Mt. Washing-
ton to just one second-half goal
until Lichtfuss’ clincher. After a
slow start initially, Brown came
on to stop 22 Mt. Washington
shots-on-goal.

Emmer also had high praise for
the starting midfield of Dudley,
Stieff and Jay Sindler. ‘‘They are
an outstanding midfield unit.”
Emmer said.

Saturday’s game could very well
be a cliff-hanger like last year,
when Carolina won, 13-12, in sud-
den death overtime. The open-
ing faceoff is at 2:00 p.m.
