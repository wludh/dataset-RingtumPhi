Gym vandalism revealed

By JOE FITZGERALD

Executive Committee junior
representative Radar Davis re-
ported to the committee at Mon-
day night’s meeting that over
$1000 worth of theft and damage
has taken place in hte gymnasium
during the present academic year.

New activities board

makes Homecoming plans
By BILL THOMSON

The newly-elected Student Acti-
vities Board discussed plans for
next year’s Fancy Dress Ball and
Homecoming Sunday night. Plans
for Homecoming have been com-
pleted, while the theme for Fancy
Dress is still being debated. Sug-
gestions from students are wel-
come, and meetings are open to
the student body.

The board for the upeoming
year is as follows: John Berley

and Mike Armstrong, co-chair-
men; Tim Hendry, treasurer;
Scott Franklin, secretary; Bill

Broders, entertainment chairman;
Charlie Hulfish and Bob Coletti,
film co-chairmen; Doug Jackson,
university center chairman; Bill
Thomson, publicity; Jim Fore-
man, Fancy Dress coordinator;
Jim Feinman, Steve McGehee,
Bill Tucker, Barry Godin, Bob
Chiavello and Jim Thomas, mem-
bers-at-large.

 

At center, Peer Gynt (played by Bill Hirschmann) is threatened by the Troll King (Warren Mowry), in

Davis obtained the figure from
Coach Bill McHenry, at the most
recent meeting of the University
Athletic Committee. Damages in-
cluded destruction of towel racks
folowing the Spinners concert as
well as other vandalism.

Thefts included removal of
clocks, the gym’s Virginia flag
and at least 12 basketballs.

According to Davis, McHenry
asked that some action be taken
by the E.C., possibly emphasizing
gymnasium procedures more dur-
ing the freshman Honor System
orientation and the law hchool
orientation.

The commmittee will be pre-
sented with a more complete and
detailed damage report at next
week’s meeting at 7 p.m. on Mon-
day. Any action will probably be
taken by the “new” E.C. since it is
too late for any comprehensive
attempts at correction of the
problems this year.

In other business, the E.C. ap-
proved a resolution congratulat-
ing the persons connected with
the production of the Mock Con-
vention for a job well done.

Also, the E.C. continued dis-

cussion of the SAB budget. SAB
treasurer Steve Norris reported
that more complete figures will be
provided once a dispute with the
sound and light personnel for the
Spinners concert is settled.

Governor Jimmy Carter of
Georgia was the nominee of the
1976 Washington and Lee Mock
Democratic Convention. Selected
as his running mate was Sena-
tor Walter Mondale of Minnesota.

Carter was selected on the sec-
ond ballot. In first ballot voting,
he was 134 votes short of the
150414 needed for nomination.
Shifts by Wallace supporters, the
Stevenson block in Illinois, and a
200 vote surge from New York
put him over the top. After the
New York vote, which gave him
1628 votes, the convention nomi-
nated Governor Carter by accla-
mation.

Mondale was also nominated by
acclamation, but in lieu of a sec-
ond ballot. The first ballot saw
votes cast for non-candidates such
as President Huntley of W&L,
Traveller and other greats of
both history and the contempor-
ary scene,

Governor Carter spoke to the
convention from Grand _ Island,
Neb., where he was campaigning.
He said the expression of confi-
dence in his candidacy was a
“very gratifying experience.” He
added that he hoped to live up to
the expectations of the conven-
tion, and perhaps to exceed them
by winning on the first ballot at
the real convention.

He went on to say ‘Our politi-
cal system is the best on earth.
Richard Nixon has not hurt it,
Watergate has not hurt it, the
Vietnam and Cambodian wars
have not hurt it. We’ve been hurt
in recent years with the em-
barrassments and the apologies
and the shame that have resulted
when our people have been sep-
arated from our government.”
He said he hoped the intimacy he
has achieved with the American
people by his constant cam-
paigning can be carried over into
the White House, “if and when I
win in November.”

The convention produced both
expected and unexpected results.
Carter’s nomination had been pre-
dicted in advance by WLUR.
Their surveys showed Carter
winning on the second ballot af-
ter receiving approximately 1200
votes on the first ballot.

The surveys were almost un-
necessary in pre-determining the
outcome. The Puerto Rico cre-
dentials challenge showed where

the strength in the convention
lay, as the Carter forces won with
a 75 votes margin.

The platform debate went much
as anticipated, as the conservative
W&L delegates voted down the
realistic liberal platform prepar-
ed by the Mock Convention. Sena-
tor William Proxmire (D.-Wis.),
the keynote speaker, called the
platform “‘a compassionate call on
government.” During his speech
he spoke in favor of the liberal
principles which the delegates
were to eliminate during the
evening session which woud run
until 1:30 a.m. Senator Proxmire’s
call for social legislation, civil
rights legislation, work legisla-
tion, environmental legislation
and support of the Equal Rights
Amendment brought a_ not-too-
sympathetic reaction from the as-
sembled delegates. The W&L re-
sponse to the standard democra-
tic planks brought the exclama-

tion, “Which convention am I at?”
from the Senator.

He was followed by Representa-
tive Donald Riegle (D-Mich.) who
took off his coat, rolled up his
shirt sleeves and roared right
back at the delegates.

The speaker Saturday morning,
Senator Dale Bumpers of Arkan-
sas, received a friendlier recep-
tion as he delivered a “unity”
speech, attacking the powers-that-
be in Washington, but not men-
tioning the Republican Party by
name.

An expected ‘“Anybody-but-
Carter” move never seemed to
develop, although a number of
states, led by California, seemed
willing to throw their votes to
Governor Jerry Brown of Califor-
nia on the second ballot if Gover-
nor Carter didn’t develop suffici-
ent strength on the first ballot.
A large-state caucus Friday night

Carter nominated on second

lot edge, but not enough votes to
win the nomination. There was a
lot of discussion at that point
about the entry of candidates who
might better “unify the party,”
such as Humphrey or Brown.

But when the votes were talli-
ed, Carter led them all with
13704 votes. His nearest chal-
lenger, Morris Udall, received
only 36042 votes. The other can-
didates, Jackson, Harris, Church,
Brown and Wallace trailed even
farther behind. Humphrey, who
was not officially nominated by
the convention, received 273
votes on the first ballot many of
those went to Carter on the sec-
ond ballot, including those of his
home state Minnesota.

The selection of Senator Mon-
dale is probably not going to be
seen in a favorable light by the
Senator. In 15 tries, the W&L
Mock Convention has never got-
ten the vice-president right.

Convention parade thrills town;

floats run the gamut of ingenuity

By PAUL SIMPSON

It wasn’t exactly on a par with
the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day or
Rose Bowl New Year's Day Par-
ades, but the 1976 Mock Democra
monies Parade can claim at least
tic Convention Opening Cere-
a title as long as either of its
more famous brothers and or sis
ters (the sex of parades never
having been determined). And,
for Lexington, the Mock Con
vention parade was pretty good

It boasted over 50 floats, six
bands, and the Leannettes Baton
Twirlers from Buena Vista. It
also boasted former Virginia
Lieutenant Governor Henry Ho
well as it's Grand Marshall and
Miss Joan Grady (Miss Virginia)
as an honored guest

The floats
the order of a
into the union with
scattered throughout

were arranged in
state's entrance
the bands

Large crowds turned out along
the parade route to decide for
themselves which was the best
float. And they had quite a selec
tion to choose from

There were the impressive
floats such as the Louisiana river
boat float which stood close to
20 feet high. The North Carolina
float took up an entire flatbed
of a tractor trailer. The Colorado
float was a very impressive and
artfuly designed Coors beer can
(opened)

There were the mock floats
such as the Montana float featur
ing Miss Mock Grand Tetons
with one unidentified student as
the mock girl and two smaller un
identified students as her mock
retons. The New Jersey float fea

tured approximately 15 students
doing Godfather impressions . . .
This has been rumored to be the
topic of the New Jersey float
since 1908, but this year, the Jer-
seyites were not content to do
what everyone else did. So, in
what some might consider to be
in questionable but undeniably
funny taste, they had their own
Jimmy Hoffa in the trunk, clad in
cement overshoes. The Maine
delegation’s lobsteretttes were
definite crowd pleasers

Then there were the inbetween
floats such as Virginia’s, which
depicted the “Athens of the
South,” the eventual first place
float (Kansas’ rendition of the

Wizard of Oz), and the lowa float
of a car masterfully disguised as
a corn cob.

The other floats ranged from
excellent to weak, but overall,
the floats were the highlights of
the parade and continually amaz-
ed the crowd (or at least kept
them on their toes, as when the
Florida delegation started pelting
people with oranges).

It's hard to say how this par-
ade compared to the parades of
previous years. With four years
between each one, | would guess
even the people who haven't
missed a Mock Convention parade
in twenty years have trouble re-

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Friday, May 14, 1976

WéL gentlemen,
cavalier conduct

On Saturday morning the northbound lanes of Interstate
81 will be crowded with Lexingtonians, natives and transients
alike, headed for Tom Jefferson's home territory, At noon
will commence the annual Washington and Lee / University
of Virginia lacrosse spectacular, to be held this year in Scott
Stadium in Charlottesville, The atmosphere promises to be
that of the traditional arch-rivalry, complete with banners, cat
calls, and occasional fistfights.

Two years ago extensisve damage was done to UVa's sta-
dium during the game, Plumbing fixtures were ripped from the
washroom walls, benches were damaged in the bleachers, and
broken glass was strewn throughout the stadium and parking
lots. Most of the damage occurred on the visitor's side of the
field, W&L’s side. Because of the vandalism the University of
Virginia has threatened to drop W&L from it’s lacrosse sche-
dule. Only after much cajoling and promises of no repeat per-
formances have the Generals been allowed to remain on the
Cavaliers’ agenda.

Our point is quite simple: have a good time on Saturday,
but don’t jeopardize our chances of ever meeting the Wa-
hoos in a lacrosse match again. We understand that it may be
popular for certain social organizations on this campus to
engage in “pranks” while in Charlottesville. We would advise
against such actions where they would imperil the reputation
of W&L.

Last spring the then -tricaptains of the lacrosse Generals
submitted to this paper an open letter to W&L supporters.
Here's what they wrote:

“We depend on your positive support to be successful, We
have some fond memories of situations . .. when we were
down ... and everyone in the stands gave us a standing and
long lasting cheer.

“There are times, however, when the feedback we receive
on vour actions is a negative one. We don't think that our fans
have to stoop so low as to embarass our opponents with of-
fensive language or actions... . Some of these negative actions
only tarnish all the positive things lacrosse and student la-
crosse fans have accomplished over the last few years.”

The advice is good, and we hope that all who attend Sat-
urday’s game will heed it. Let's continue our winning ways, in
our conduct on the fiteld oan din our conduct in the stands.
our conduct on the field and in our conduct in the stands.

Best of luck to the Generals!
—S§.C.Y.

Congratulations

The cochairmen, the steering committee, the state chair-
men, and everyone else involved with the 1976 Mock Demo-
cratic Convention should be commended for the fine effort
which culminated in the two-day extravaganza held in Lexing-
ton this past weekend, The years of planning, the long hours
of research, the telephone calls placed and the letters mailed,
everything that was put into the gargantuan undertaking pro-
duced an orchestrated result of which the University and the
whole community can be proud,

There were flaws in the proceedings, to be sure, but most
of these were the result of the moderate-to-conservative. Re-
publican inclinations of the average W&L student One thing
that did bother us was the presence of those empty seats in the
larger delegations we would have hoped that more of the
student body would have spent the time in the gymnasium on
Friday and Saturday.

On Monday night the new chairmen of the steering com-
mittee for the 1980 Mock Demoeratic/Republican (pick one)
Convention were picked. Soon the planning will begin anew,
We hope that those who will be here in May of 1980 will be as
successful in organizing their convention as were those who
hopefully picked the correct nominee this year,

The Mock Convention, a stunn-
ing political interlude between
Springs weekend and the campus
showing of “Deep Throat”, is fin-
ally over. It was a phenomenon
difficult to bring into focus as a
whole; therefore, what follows is
essentially a pile of semi-legible
notes arranged with no small
amount of consternation into what
will hopefully serve as an accur-
ate, or at least readable summary
of what happened this past week-
end in Doremus.

Thursday, May 6

Scrounging the campus for
some signs of excitement, all I
find are several people with a
strange gleam in their eyes. Upon
further investigation it turns out
that most of them have been
drinking masive quantities of
beer.

Beer and Henry Howell are the
topies of talk for many of the peo-
ple I see. One person found both
at a four-delegation party at the
far end of town. Thinking he may
have gained some political in-
sights between beers, I asked him
whether the voting would go to
Carter on the second or third bal-
lot. He had no idea.

Another man I spoke to was a
Ilumphrey supporter. He didn’t
know which ballot but he was cer-
tain it had already been determin-
ed. He insisted that someone in
charge knew which ballot would
give the nomination to the noted
peanut farmer. “This thing is rig-
ged,” he said.

He told me the whole thing was
controlled by four or five people.
I had no particular evidence to
dispute what he said at the time,
but I couldn’t see where the poli-
tical predestination was wrong.
After all, if we can believe the
news magazines this week, that’s
how many people are running the
Carter bid in the real world. A
new kind of political machine is
in the works that allows you to
compute your way into the White
House.

A lot of people on the steering
committee would be sorely troub-
led if they realized how many
folks out there don’t really give a
damn about the MC. Those folks
are playing basketball tonight.
They wander by from the old gym
now and then and ponder the red,
white, and bicentennial “conven-
tion hall” with bemused smiles.

inside the convention hall
there are 1200 empty chairs with
1200 “information packets” ex-
plaining approximately what a
delegate to a Mock Democratic
Convention should do with him-
self. The rafters are festooned

with tri-colored banners (guess
what three colors) and the re-
tracted bleachers behind the po-
dium sport a row of American
flags. On the wall facing the doors
there are campaign posters for all
the major candidates except Hu-
bert Humphrey and Ellen McCor-
mack.

People keep telling me that the
man responsible for this fantasti-

&

 

talked to him for being a little too
zealous in his work. I was remind-
ed of Mr. Humphrey’s would-be
fundraiser standing on the plat-
form looking glum when HHH
dropped out of a campaign he had
never entered after Pennsylvania.
One person on the steering com-
mittee said it might have been bet-
ter to turn loose the Humphrey
supporter on the floor to add

The Mississippi Delegation goes wild during one of many “spon-

taneous” demonstrations.

cal set-up is Scott Watson and that
he deserves an enormous number
of Kudos (whatever those are).
They are duly given with an apol-
ogy that the good man’s work has
not been mentioned earlier in this
column.

An insider on the steering com-
mittee, parent company for the
four or five people controlling the
nomination, informed me that the
nod would go to Carter on the sec-
ond ballot. When I asked if that
was a decision or an educated
guess, he said, in no particular or-
der, “An educated guess
(grin) .. . a little decision . . . no-
body knows I told you this... .”

It turned out that the HHH man
I talked to earlier got bounced by
the four or five people who know
which ballot, and serupulously
deny it. He was removed from the
campaign about an hour after I

Letters To

Glover strikes back;
paper’s abuses detailed

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

After reading last week's bias-
ed editorial, “Of Budgets, Sti-
pends and Kitchens,” I felt com-
pelled to express my opinion on
an issue of a more important na-
ture—the negative attitude re-
flected by the Phi staff and many
students toward the Executive
Committee.

It is inevitable that the E. C.,
just as any other governing body,
be the subject of a certain degree
of criticism, Admittedly, we real-
ize that our actions are not with-
out flaw, and so consequently,
constructive criticism serves to
keep us on our ties. However, |
strongly feel that the Ringtum
Phi’s often one-sided, melodrama-
tie articles about the E.C. are
largely responsible for inciting
misunderstanding and discontent
for a group which takes its duties
very seriously. We do, indeed, try
to act in the best interest of the
majority of Washington and Lee
students, but, naturally, we can-
not please everyone on all issues.

Mr. Yevich, we have been criti-
cized by you and your staff for
forming too many subcommittees
to investigate matters, for taking
more than what you consider a
“reasonable” amount of time to
make a decision, and for allocat-
ing funds for purposes with which
you do not agree, Yet, I feel that
we are fulfilling our responsibil-
ity to the Student Body—often
above what is required of us—
even though you might wish to
impart your own set of procedures
and outcomes. I do believe, as
well, that much of your eriticism

of the E.C, results because of your
inability to discover more news-
worthy items, as evidenced by last
week’s 5 E. C. articles and 3 la-
crosse articles. Surely, last week's
Phi could have included better
coverage of the Meck Convention,
such as notification of and back-
ground on the speakers, final de-
velopments of the Steering Com-
mittee, or the proeedure to be fol-
lowed on the convention floor, Or
perhaps you might have chosen to
mention the fact that one of the
big events for this weekend in-
cluded the Spring Alumni Re-
unions,

In conclusion, I wish to state
that, although I may occasionally
disagree with a majority decision
of the E.C., I ean, in good faith,
abide by it because I realize the
care and seriousness of purpose
with which this decison was made
in the minds of these other gentle-
men, I urge both our critics on the
Phi staff and the Student Body, as
well, to either reaffirm their con-
fidence in the E.C. or to quit bie-
kering and elect representatives
in whom they have faith.

Respectfully,
Mynders Glover
Vice-President, Student Body

Sophomore finds fault
with Goldberg’s writing

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:
Although I have come to ex-
pect precious little from your
newspaper, I must say your May 6

you have printed to date. Seldom
have I seen such naked bias, twist-
ed half truth, and near libelous

some color to the convention.
From the looks of Saturday’s out-
come, the plan was not carried
out.

Friday, May 7

(The following paragraph was
written sometime Friday after-
noon).

Tonight’s session will probably
go to 10:30. Originally someone
on the steering committee sug-
gested that ending the session
then would allow the delegates to
drink until 12:30 and then get
ready for the next day’s early ses-
sion at 9 a.m. Phil Hatchett sug-
gested that they try to run it to
midnight so the delegates would
only drink for half an hour in-
stead of two. Rick Wolf explained
that the plan wasn’t for people to
drink until 12:30, The fact of the
matter was, according to Wolf,
that the people were going to

drink for two hours regardless of
when the session ended.

(The following paragraphs were
printed in the Ring-tum Phi fol-
lowing the 1972 Mock Convention.
The words were written by the
"7172 editor of the paper, John
Robinson.)

“The party platform was volu-
minous .. . It seemed absurd to
try roll call votes with debate on
each plank. But the absurd reign-
ed supreme, as that was exactly
what the Convention set out to do.
The results were quite fatiguing.
A liberal platform was transform-
ed into the latest Conservative
Manifesto.

Georgia Governor Jimmy Car-
ter made a keynote address of
considerable merit. As one stu-
dent observed, ‘It’s unfortunate
that Carter gave an anti-Republi-
can speech to a student body that
is largely Republican.”

(In the paragraph above, one
might consider substituting the
name of William Proxmire where
Carter’s name appears.)

The convention begins with a
statement of traditional Democra-
tic party principles during the in-
vocation, a statement that brings
the word “radical” snarling
through the lips of one person in
the press box. Perhaps a good in-
dication of what is to come. The
expressions by students of their
Republican leanings led Mr. Prox-
mire to ask at one point if he was
at the right convention. The
speech of Don Riegle found sup-
port from the crowd more for its
fire and rhetoric than for the prin-
ciples and politics outlined, There
were scattered boos when Riegle
began denouncing the oil com-
panies, but cheers and pandemoni-
ous approval broke out when the
shirt-sleeved politico gestured
madly and told the listeners, “It’s
a ripoff, IT’S A RIPOFF, IT’S A
RIPOFFIHIN!H” A stirring oratory,
if nothing else.

But neither speech brought
quite the applause that greeted
President Robert E. R. Huntley
when he ended his opening re-
marks with Alben Barkley’s last
words from the 1956 Mock Con-
vention. By now, most people pro-
bably know the story of how the
former vice-president spoke the
words, “I would rather be a ser-
vant in the house of the Lord,
than to sit in the seats of the
mighty,” and then fell over with
a fatal heart attack.

Whether it was the quote or the
general speech is probably irrele-
vant. What mattered was the de-
monstration that followed, 2500
hands clapping for the first of

phrasing attempt to masquerade
as good reporting. | am referring,
of course, to the article entitled
“Mock Convention arrives: who
will W and L nominate?”

Before | came to Washington
and Lee, | worked as associate edi-
tor of the Mercer University stu-
dent newspaper. There I was
taught a fundamental rule of good
newspaperwork; opinions belong
on the editorial page. The front
page is for news. Though the sub-
ject of Mr. Goldberg's article was
worthy of front page treatment, its
wording was more fit for the
depths of a political tract or the
columns of First Monday.

Only once did Mr. Carter's name
appear, and that was in refenence
to an “Anybody-But-Carter” move-
ment. The rest of the article re-
ferred to him as “an atomic pea-
nut farmer.” “the piano-faced
plowboy,” and “the heir of Lester
Maddox.’ “fhe first phrase was in-
nocuous enough and might have
been aceptable had it been fol-
lowed by some form of explana-
tion or clarification, neither of
which was fortheoming. Instead,
Mr. Goldberg chose to call the
man a “piano-faced plowboy,” a
choice of words that reflects con-
tempt for the oceupation of far-
mer and those who follow it, and
constitutes an editorial comment
on the candidate's fitness to hold
the ofifee he seeks.

What most irritated me, though,
was the reference to Mr. Carter
as “the heir of Lester Maddox.”
Such a statement, in light of Mr.
Maddox's record, is not only a dis
tortion of fact, but is a near libel-
ous insinuation that reflects a
complete ignorance of Georgia
polities during the Carter Admini-
stration, Had Mr. Goldberg done

his homework, he would have
found that Mr. Carter and Mr.
Maddox were the bitterest of
enemies, and that the Carter-Mad-
dox legislative battles were some
of the most heated and vicious
fights in the state’s history. True,
Mr. Carter's administration follow-
ed that of Mr. Maddox, but to call
Mr. Carter a political heir is to
imply a common political and
philosophical base, and is rather
like calling Thomas Jefferson the
heir of John Adams, or Warren G.
Harding the heir of Woodrow Wil-
son, Would you call Mr. Jefferson
a Federalist? Would you imply
Mr. Harding's support of the Lea-
gue of Nations? Obviously not, To
do so would be to ignore the facts
of their administrations. That is
precisely what Mr, Goldberg has
done. Out of ignorance and a ten-
dency to lump all Southern polli-
ticlans under one bad heading,
Mr. Goldberg has chosen to im-
ply that Mr. Carter is a clown, an
ignorant hayseed, and an ax-han-
dle-wielding bigot.

The days of poll taxes, lynch-
ings, and white-only bathrooms
are past, Mr. Goldberg. Lester has
slunk off to his lair in Under-

The deal comes down

(Continued from Page 2)
many playings of the ‘“Washing-
ton and Lee Swing”, the most imit-
ated of all college fight songs and
arguably the best convention
music, at least in Lexington, that
anyone ever wrote.

After Lexington mayor Charles
Phillips took the podium for a
moment to remind Henry Howell
that in Lexington the utilities are
being put in their proper place,
“six feet under,” the real business
of the convention began with the
first roll call, as clerk Jeff Peck
issued his first resounding ‘“Ala-
bama.”

Few thought at the time of what
the situation would be some ten
hours later, when the die-hard
clerk would finish another roll-
call, on a gun control plank for
the platform, with his voice crack-
ing as he asked “Are there any
more changes?”

By then there were 349 people
left on the floor, not counting the
press and security people. I was
sitting in the back rows of the
near-empty floor just before the
gun control plank came up, talk-
ing to a security man in resplen-
dent red MC T-shirt who explain-
ed the procedural matters going on
in a thick Carolina drawl. “What
we've got here,” he explained, “is
a mathematical equation involv-
ing the factors of alcohol, late-
ness, and general confusion; the
three come together to create a
problem that can’t be overcome.”

The guard was doing more theo-
rizing than securing at the time.
Efforts to stop the flow of brew
had long since ceased and the con-
vention was reaching a dead end
when an exhausted Reed Morgan
stepped to the podium to explain
how to vote on yet another plank.

“An aye vote will make it part of
the platform,” he said, “And a
nay will .. .” At this point he
waved his hand and looked con-
fused. Someone on the floor call-
ed out “bag it.” “That’s right,”
Morgan said, looking very reliev-

ed, “It'll bag it.”

Saturday, May 8

I was wondering during the

“unity speech” from Sen. Bum-

pers why he should get cheers
from the floor where Sen. Prox-
mire was booed so resoundingly
the night before. One person told
me that a certain student from
Bumpers’ home state, Arkansas,
had warned all delegates that if
the senator were greeted with cat-
calls, someone was going to pay.

Someone in the press box ex-
plained it a little differently. He
explained that the Republicans
had been up late the night before
trying to get minority planks add-
ed to the platform. They had stay-
ed up so late that they were all
stil in bed, so the Democrats had
a majority to greet Bumpers.

Bumpers speech was the first
indication of how the day was to

go. It was a Southern day from
start to finish. Dorman Walker,
Alabama native and Carter’s cam-
paign co-ordinator on the floor,
walked around with a grin that
would put the Georgia governor
to shame. Harry T. Jones of Geor-
gia gave the speech seconding the
nomination of Carter. In a drawl
that would, like Walker’s grin, put
Mr. Carter to shame, he suggested
to the convention, ‘“Let’s put an-
other farmer in the White House.”
Russell Moore of Alabama had de-
livered the first speech nominat-
ing Carter.

Following Carter’s nomination
by acclamation, the sound system
boomed out the words of our na-
tional anthem, “And I wish I was
in Dixie .. .”’ and even the most
serious doubters knew that indeed
they couldn’t possibly be any-
where else.

After “Dixie’”’ and the umpteen-
th playing of the “Swing”, the de-
legates began filing out and pre-
paring their ludicrous vice-presi-
dential votes. As they left, the
sound system came alive again
with the words of a song not quite
so traditional as some of the oth-
ers, Bruce Springsteen’s slashing
rocker, “Born to Run’. Although
the playing of the song was coin-
cidental, owing to its place on the
tape, it was perhaps a significant
comment on the many politicians
considered and rejected this morn-
ing, and the one finally chosen.

When the delegates returned,
there was some doubt, but not
much, as to whom they would pick
to run with Carter. The nod would
probably go to Mondale, because,
as Dorman Walker explained it
earlier, “That’s the deal I just
made.” So there was plenty of
room for the delegates to play
around during the afternoon, giv-
ing votes for vp to everyone from
Bobby Pugh to Elvis Presley.

The afternoon’s color came not
only from the variety of the vice-
presidential votes, but also from
the required descriptions of the
states by the people reading off
the vote tallies.

California, the home of the
Beach Boys and California girls

Georgia ,the home of Coca-cola

Illinois, the home of the St.
Valentine’s day massacre and the
world’s greatest mayor...

The Virgin Islands, where celi-
bacy has been a way of life for

200 years...

Guam, the home of lizards and
B-52’s .

Kansas, the home of Vivian

Vance, John Cameron Swayze, and
not much else...

And West Virginia, nominating
their favorite son, Sen. Robert
Byrd, with the words, “We're gett-
ing the finger from Washington,
we might as well put a Byrd in
the White House.”

In the long run, the delegates
were not quite that fatalistic.
They also were not reserved, calm,
or dignified for the most part. But
none of that counts. In the long
run, let’s just hope they were
right.

Generals eye Saturday showdown

By BILL FLESHER

Washington and Lee’s lacrosse
team set the stage for this week’s
showdown against archrival Vir-
ginia with a pair of wins over
both top-rated college division
teams last week.

The Generals played a strong
second half Wednesday to pull
away from last week’s number
one squad, Roanoke College, 12-8,
then shook off a case of the post-
Mock Convention blahs to stop
Cortland State, 13-10, just hours
before the Red Dragons replaced
Roanoke at the top of the college
division poll.

W&L had a different leader in
both games—Jay Sindler pumped
in three goals against Roanoke,
while freshman attackman Jeff
Fritz had his best day as a col-
legian with five tallies and an as-
sist against the Red Dragons.

But the player of the week for
the Generals was junior defense-
man Tom Kiegler, who shocked
both opponents with three goals—
two against Cortland—while daz-
zling the crowds with his superb
stick handling.

W&L head coach Jack Emmer
may have put it best after the Sun-
day’s game. “Thank God for Tom
Keigler,’ Emmer said, echoing the
sentiments of nearly every W&L
lacrosse supporter.

The week in review

The most boisterous crowd of
the season saw W&L play a sloppy
first half against Roanoke, a team
that had never beaten the Gen-
erals in seven meetings.

After Chris Kearney gave W&L
its only lead of the first half at
1-0, the Maroons ran off three
straight goals before Rob Mor-
gan scored near the end of the
opening quarter.

Mike Hayden, Roanoke’s lead-
ing scorer, got an unassisted goal
30 seconds into the second period
to put the Maroons ahead 4-2,
which is how it stayed for the bet-
ter part of the quarter.

Sindler then put the first of his
three goals past Roanoke goalie
Bill Beroza at 12:43 to cut the
Maroon lead to 43, then Keigler,
who leads all defensemen in goals
scored, went the length of the
field to tie the game just 27 sec-
onds before halftime.

W&L took command in the third
stanza, taking the lead for good
on Donny Carroll's goal at 3:34.

land State.

Roanoke pulled to within one at
7-6, but goals by Carroll, Morgan,
and Jack Dudley put the game
away.

The Generals prevailed despite
being outshot, 49-42. W&L goalie
Charlie Brown came up with 20
saves, while Beroza had 18 for the
Maroons.

Sunday’s matchup with Cort-
land State proved to be one of the

least but most exciting games of
the year.

W&L held the Red Dragons
seoreless for nearly 28 minutes in
the first half while working its
fast break to perfection, setting
Fritz up for four of his five goals
to take a 5-0 lead. Extra man goal
by Mike Hoppey for Cortland and
Morgan gave the Generals a 6-1
lead at intermission.

Then the Generals, and the
crowd of 3000, appeared to go to
sleep. Cortland struck for four
unanswered goals in the third per-
iod to get back into the game at
6-5.

The Red Dragons retained the
momentum, coming back with a
goal for each one scored by W&L
until Hoppey’s third goal tied the
game at 9-9 with 9:12 left.

But as was the case against Roa-
noke, the Generals had an offen-
sive weapon no one counted on.
After breaking up a Cortland
clearing attempt, Keigler took a
feed from Carroll and bounced the
ball off a Red Dragon defender
into the goal to put W&L ahead by
one.

The Generals increased their
lead when Carroll, who finished
with five assists, passed to Dud-
ley, who fired a behind-the-back
shot past an unsuspecting Cort-
land goalie Wayne Werner.

Cortland’s John Walsh cut the
lead to one, 11-10, when he beat
Brown with a bounce shot from 12
yards out, but W&L again went
ahead by two as Doug Fuge scor-
ed with 3:30 left.

Then the suspense began. Just
fifteen seconds later, W&L de-
fenseman Rob Lindsey was found
to be playing with an illegal stick,
a violation accompanied by a
three-minute penalty.

However Cortland managed just
one shot in the extra-man situa-
tion before Brown came up with a
loose ball in the corner. The Gen-
erals controlled the ball for al-
most two minutes before Jay Sind-
ler avoided three Red Dragon de-
fenders and passed to Keigler,
who pumped a shot into the lower
corner to sew the game up.

Again the Generals were out-
shot, 62-38. However Brown came
up with a 24-save effort, perhaps
his best game of the season.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

A letter
to the fans

To the Student Body:

History seems to repeat itself
when concerning the W&L-U.Va.
lacrosse game. The game has de-
veloped into an intense rivalry
without the additional pressure
of being selected for the NCAA
tournament which hangs upon
Saturday’s result. Yet for the sec-
ond consecutive year it is most
likely that the winner of this
game will receive an invitation
while the losing team hands in its
equipment.

The Washington and Lee play-
ers and coaches relish the thought
of travelling to Charlottesville to
discover that we'll have greater
support from our students than
that of the home team Cavaliers.
We've become reliant on our fans
to give us that extra boost when
needed but we are somewhat con-
cerned. A year ago we lost one of
our faithful fans from the student
body to a needless car accident
because booze and driving just
doesn’t mix. Our team counts on
your being there in force but we
also hope your support is positive
and we can avoid the destruction
done to the University of Virginia
stadium facilities as in 1974.

Most of all, however, we would
like to see you all back here safe-
ly on Monday to re-hash another
sweet victory over the Wahoos.
Four in a row sounds good to me.

Sincerely,
Jack Emmer
Coach of Lacrosse

But the nice thing is, no one

the catalyst that puts people in

good time, all rolled into one.

And that’s no small feat in it-
self.

The convention is over, and
Doremus is almost back to nor-
mal. It is dark, and no one is
using it, obviously Dick Miller is
back in power. Two-thirds of the
rubber put down to protect the
floor is still there. Even the bas-
ketball hoops are still cranked
up so they can’t be used. Bunting
still hangs from the rafters, but
the mood is gone, This isn’t Con-
vention Hall anymore, it is Dore-
mus gym with rubber on the floor

 

and red, white and blue flags
hanging from the rafters.

But it had its moment. For a
few hours, the room was alive
with purpose, filled with cur-
rents, cross-currents and under-
currents of political and emotion-
al drama.

There was the serious side.
Full of the tradition of 10 of 15
right conventions in 68 years, the
delegates, chairmen, steering
committee, and most of all, the
PR director were out to “get it

right.” There were phones all
over the place—a fifteen-phone-
room, phones in the press gal-
lery, phones in the gym offices.
“If you don’t know, call and
find out” seemed to be what they
were saying. “We can’t afford to
get this one wrong.” And in the
name of “party unity” they tap-
ped Governor Jimmy Carter, a
Georgia peanut farmer who
smiles a lot.

There was also a light side to
the convention. Fun and _ horse-

a half vote). They hit the world
of entertainment, no doubt hop-
ing for a Democratic Ronald Rea-
gan—Bruce Springsteen, Bob
Dylan, Jimmy Buffet, Elvis Pres-
ley, Harold Melvin and the Blue-
notes represented music; Mary
Hartmann, Captain James _ T.
Kirk, Mr. Spock and Pat Paulsen
from TV, Colonel Sanders, Secre-
tariat, and Muhammad Ali from
Kentucky. Several _ politicians
were called from the grave, Cal-
vin Coolidge, Alf Landon, Richard
Nixon.

There were even some serious
candidates, men like Dale Bum-
pers, Adlai Stevenson, Jerry
Brown, Edmund Muskie, Morris
Udall, and George Wallace. But
they all lost out in the resound-
ing voice vote which picked a
Senator from Minnesota (who
else do we know from. that
State?) for the sake of “party
unity.”

One of the most ironic rumors
which came to rest on the floor
was that New York’s 200-vote
switch was not for the sake of
“party unity” at all, but because
beautiful ABC reporter Bettina
Gregory asked the steering com-
mittee to wrap it up before 2
p.m. because she had a deadline
and had to get back to New York.
Hmmm... ?

Of course the big question
now, and what will keep the Mock
Convention Steering Committee
on pins and needles until June,
is WERE WE RIGHT? Will the
real party follow our lead so we
can keep our record? And so,
we'll all wonder, will the party
come together, will it unify in the
face of the common foe, the Re-
publicans? Will it nominate
Jimmy Carter? Or, will Jerry
Brown beat Carter in the West,
sweep into the convention with
a momentum which can’t be stop-
ped and be chosen the “unity”
candidate?

As one candidate’s floor co-or-
dinator said to the co-ordinator
for the Georgia governor, “I still
hate the guy.”

Is that “party unity?”

beaten Virginia the past three
years, a W&L win will still be
considered a shocker in the eyes
of the media. After all, Virginia
is ranked sixth in the latest
USILA poll, their 5-4 record evi-
dently impressing enough of the
voters to keep them well ahead
of the 8-4 Generals.

Actually, the Cavaliers are 6-5
on the season, but one game on
each side of the ledger has been
nullified by protests based on tri-
vial rulings.

An allegedly illegal substitu-
tion cost Roanoke College its 11-
10 win over the Wahoos, while
Towson State successfully chal-
lenged Virginia’s 16-15 overtime
decision on the grounds that a
stick check that resulted in a
three-minute penalty had been re-
quested at an improper time.

There is little doubt that UVa.
should be somewhere in the poll’s
second five. Their four losses
have come at the hands of teams
rated second through fifth—
Maryland, Johns Hopkins, Navy,
and North Carolina.

Yet have the Cavaliers earned
the number six spot in the rank-
ings? The facts would indicate
otherwise. For one, UVa. has not
been closer than three goals in
any of its losses.

Then there is the question of
the quality of those teams Vir-
ginia has beaten. The Wahoos
have recorded impressive wins
over college division foes Wash
ington College and Maryland-
Baltimore County, but neither of

those teams are seeded higher
than fifth in their tournament.
The other three Cavalier wins
have come at the expense of
Franklin and Marshall, William
and Mary, and Duke, schools
feeling privileged to be men-
tioned in the same breath with
Johns Hopkins or Maryland.

All of this is not to infer that
the Cavaliers are not a good la-
crosse team. They did take de-
fending national champion Mary-
land into overtime before the
Terps flexed their muscles and
blew UVa. halfway back to Char-
lottesville.

But the evidence is plentiful if
not overwhelming against the
Wahoos’ claim to a spot above
W&L (or even the unknown quan-
tities at Massachusetts and
Brown) in the USILA poll.

Once again the task of putting
Virignia in its proper place falls
to Washington and Lee. The Gen-
erals have responded—be it in up-
set fashion or otherwise—in each
of the past three seasons. Their
fans, the university community,
and most of the college lacrosse
world is hoping they'll do it
again.
