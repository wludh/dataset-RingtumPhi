THE RING-TUM PHI

 

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Thursday, October 9, 1975

In the defense
of Tradition

Last week there was a conference of student leaders and
deans of area colleges at the Peaks of Otter. Washington and
Lee sent four representatives to the gathering; cach return-
ed with the conviction that although the University is not
Without its faults, it is coping with its problems better than
most colleges in the vicinity.

A recurring theme which manifested itself in the most un-
likely of moments was retrenchment. By that we mean a re-
turn to values and standards abandoned in yesteryear. This
movement to retrench is not coming from faculties or admini-
strations, but from student bodies.

Some examples of the phenomenon can easily be cited.
There is a definite trend among students everywhere to once
again center their collegiate lives around the campus, with a
concurrent increase in demand for dormitories and other on-
campus facilities.

Another tendency brought up in discussion was the stu-
dent preference for strengthened rather than loosened distri-
bution or core requirements. It seems that of late many stu-
dents have discovered, much to their chagrin, that they are
being graduated from self-proclaimed liberal arts colleges with
something less than liberal arts educations.

A third example students are in favor of shoring up
honor systems that have been weakened by neglect and abuse,
“outmoded” and “mean-

rather than scrapping the systems as
ingless.”

Washington and Lee is a peculiar institution, one steeped
in tradition, one unresponsive to rapid change, and one often-
ed chastised for being out of step. And yet the dilatory pace
of change exhibited here has spared the University the
trauma of excessive change and subsequent retrenchment.
Careful deliberation and purposeful but restrained modifiea-
tion have brought us to the point toward which others are
backpedaling from their avant-garde but tenuous positions.

—S.C.Y.

Quiet places to study

It has been brought to the attention of the student govern-
ment that the list of study rooms available on campus in the
evenings is dimmishing. Many classrooms, and in some in-
stances nearly whole buildings, are locked up in the late after-
noon, to sit idle until A Period the following day, More and
more students are forced to spend their nocturnal study hours
in MeCormick Hall, a building already taxed to its limits in
daily use.

Some administrators have suggested that students are de-
nied access to some rooms in order to prevent them from
“trashing” them at night, leaving a mess for some unwitting
professor to cope with the following day. It has also been
mentioned that a single student using a classroom is not worth
the electricity wasted,

We disagree. McCormick cannot supply the student body
with all the study space it needs, and the new library is still
shrouded in the mists of the future, It seems unreasonable
to deny students the use of rooms for study purposes. A single
student seeking a quiet room within which to study is not go-
ing to generate a roomful of garbage to clutter up desks, nor ts
he going to cause the electric bill to skyrocket,

Students are here to study, Let them.

Letters to the

Ring-tum Phi editor,

articles criticized
Editor, The Ring-cum Phi:

‘The three issues of the Phi that
have been published so far have
been just awful, The writing is unin-
spired, the headlines are dead, the
“Traveller” column is Z-7-7-Z-7-7Z,
and the editorials are pompous and
empty.

‘The problem is clear. Pi Kappa Phi
has a stranglehold on the Publica-
tions Board, That board dictates the
editors of the campus publications,
including the Phi, It is no surprise
that the editor of the Calyx, an edi-
tor of the Ariel, and the editor of
the Phi ave all members of Pi Phi.
While some are certainly qualified,
some obviously are not,

The editors should be selected on
the basis of merit, not fraternity mem-
bership. With this in mind, TP back
the suggestion that the Publications
Board be reorganized. The Journal-
ism Department should appoint three
students to the board, The editor of
the Calyx should appoint one stu-
dent. And, one student should be
appointed by the editor of the Ariel.

Clearly something must be done to
return the = student Publications
Board to the students. If these sug
gestions are followed, it will be.

WLUR programming

comes under fire
Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

lt certainly is refreshing to wake
up cach morning to WLUR's an-
nouncement of the day's lunch at the
Buena Vista Public Schools. One
might expect morning programming
at a college radio station to consist
of refreshing soft rock and announce-
ments pertaining to student affairs;
but of course, this is a totally unjust
expectation when one is confronted

He has a certain flair with the songs
but they are only replays, His really
shining moments come on his own
compositions, from “Nature's gonna
get you” (an ode to Blue Ridge
honeybees), to a song about a girl
with an unusual name, because, “How
could you not write a song about a
girl with a name like that?”

Owen hails from upstate New York,
where he and an occasional partner
named Douglas Paul write songs to-
gether, He said he finds W&L a
“nice change” not only from the
scenery to Which he is accustomed
but also from the other Rathskellers

editor

with the brilliant and original LUR
morning show, consisting of a fifteen
minute weather report and bland
and repetitious music.

Our radio station's programming
at other times shows great diversity,
and is beyond reproach, It is undeni-
ably a radio broadcasting coup to
vary from programs on Italian Mas-
ters of the sixteenth century to Ttal-
ian Masters of the seventeenth cen-
tury. May I be so bold as to suggest
more Gregorian chants, since their
great popularity amongst the stu-
dents is clearly manifest. Certainly,
music of the primitive instruments of
Indonesia would also make a fine
programming inclusion, considering
its universal appeal.

Vo those in Reid Hall who are re-
sponsible for LUR’s management,
and who are obviously so successful
at gaging the likes and dislikes of the
vast majority of W&L men, I say “a
job well done!”

Respectfully,
Cyrus McCormick

 

Letters-to-the-Editor are always
welcome. They should be in good
taste, refer to campus issues, avoid
excessive length and present a co-
herent point of view,

“Rathskellers are usually
places to play,” he said. In contrast,
his audience Monday night) turned
their chairs around to face him and
listened to his music in a reserved, if
not quiet manner. Owen also. said
that W&L is a “nice-looking cam-
pus.” He was especially impressed by
the tombs of the Lee family, “It was
nice seeing them all up there in the
wall,” he said. “It's beautiful.”

The students seemed to think the
same of his guitar-playing so far, ‘Phis
reviewer has not heard so much ap-
plause in the Cockpit: since Henry
Fonda ordered the demolition of New
York City during last Winter's show-
ing of “Failsafe,”

Jan Owen has net destroyed New

impression on W&L,

The SAB's new sound system is
still somewhere between New York
and here, but should arrive in’ time
for the next performer, who will be
a pianist if the SAB can find a piano
somewhere that will fit in the CGock-
pit. Meanwhile, Jan Owen will be
playing a few more sets with the old
system,

‘Today he plays at 5:15—right in the
middle of Happy Hour—and again at
nine. ‘Tomorrow he will play at 6:45
and again at eight, just before the
Homecoming dance, Saturday he
plays three sets, one at 7 p.m., an-
other at 9 pam., and the last at 10:30,

New group organized
to coordinate speakers

A Bicentennial speakers’ bureau
will soon be in operation at W&L.

The speakers’ bureau will consist of
students who will determine their
own topics and format for delivery,

Speeches will be either informa-

ture, or persuasive, in which the
speaker attempts to make a point or
convince the audience of an opinion.

Sponsored by a Bicentennial grant
from the Virginia Internship Pro-
gram, the bureau will be directed by

Sticking doors, mudslides, cold

water plague new apartments

by MIKE ODOM

From the beginning it seems as
though the recently completed Woods
Creck apartment complex has been
plagued with student complaints,
Some of them are warranted and
some, of course, ave not, Notably, the
unwarranted ones concern the limit-
ed parking space and the ever-pre
sent mud in back of the building.
Students complaining about the for
mer argue that the only place they
have to park their cars is often fill-
ed with rubble from the construc.
tion of the law school up the street;
however, right up the street in the op-
posite direction is the gym parking
area Which is specifically designated
for Woods Creck residents

two complaints which ave warranted,
The first has finally been tended to,
but it took almost three weeks to do
so, Because of poor supervision and
some hasty work, which was done in
an assembly line instead of here at
the apartments, most of the water
heating units were defective, Conse-
quently, for the first few weeks of
school many of us were taking cold
showers, It is to the credit of WRL's
Buildings and Grounds Crew, and not
Kane, that we have hot water now;

company in view of the fact that the

The one gripe which stands out
above all the others, in that it has
not been silenced, is our insufficient
heating. We do have some heat, but
the thought of studying in the bath-
with the hot shower running
doesn't really excite too many occu-
pants, Since most complaints have

been answered, this one probably
shall soon be remedied. If not,

Generals defeated
by Randolph-Macon

Sports Staff

Washington and Lee University
tight end ‘Tony Perry rose to second
plaice on the all-time career list’ for
receivers as the Generals fell to Ran-
dolph-Macon, 26-14, last Saturday,

His four catches against the Yellow
Jackets, including one Hl-yarder for
a touchdown, brought his career
mark to 93 catches for 1.132 yards and
nine touchdowns. With nearly two
full seasons to go, the junior from
Waynesboro has an excellent chance
to catch the all-time leader, Steve
Mahaffey,

Mahaffey played for only two and
a half seasons (1968-69-70), but com-
piled an amazing career record of
127 catches for 1,449 yards and eight
TDs. Much of that came in his last
year, when he led the nation with
74 catches for 897 yards and two
scores.

Despite all the record-setting per-
formances, Perry and his W&L team-
mates no doubt would trade all the
statistics for a victory, hopefully this
Saturday when the Generals (0-2-1)
return home to face a tough Home-
coming foe, Southwestern of Mem-
phis, The Lynx, 2-2 for the year, will
visit W&L's Wilson Field for a 1:50
pan. kickoff,

W&L coach Bill) MeHlenry was
“greatly disappointed” at the Ran-
dolph-Macon outcome, The Generals
dominated the first half and scored
first for a 7-0 lead, but wilted badly
in the second half,

“We started off so well, moving the
ball consistently and playing some
sound defense,” McHenry comment-
ed. “Unfortunately, when our se-
cond score that would have given us
a two-touchdown lead called
back on a penalty, we seemed to lose
the spark we had enjoyed earlier.”

was

A holding infraction called against
the Generals nullified a 29-yard
touchdown on which Perry made one
of his patented leaping grabs, A
week carlier against Centre, an even
more spectacular touchdown catch
was crased when officials ruled Perry
was beyond the end zone,

“Our inability to put together four
quarters of consistent football has
hurt us in all three games to date,”
McHenry noted. “We've got to work
hard this week to overcome any
mental lapses that have hurt us.”

Scouting reports indicate South-
western'’s Lynx have suffered the same
inconsistencies, particularly on of-
fense. Coach Don Lear's team has
scored at least two touchdowns in
every game, but it is their defense
that McHenry fears most. In their
last two games, both victories, South-
western has limited the opposition to
just 10 points,

‘The Lynx also boast a great threat
in veturn specialist Conrad Brad-
burn, who ran three kicks back for
touchdowns (one was nullified by
penalty) when Southwestern embar-
rassed the Generals, 32-0, last year in
Memphis,

463-2595

 

Quarterback Jack Berry displays excellent passing form against Centre.
Last Saturday against Randolph-Macon he was 15-30 for 121 yds. with

one TD.

Soccer winless

Despite last week's 5-0 loss to the
Bobeats of West Virginia Wesleyan,
and the four preceding losses, W&L's
soccer team is looking for a repeat of
last year’s upset of the nationally
ranked Lynchburg College Hornets
when the two teams meet Saturday
at Lynchburg.

Lynchburg fields a squad that is
balanced in every aspect of the game
and includes one of the top scorers
in the nation, Bob Coote. The Gen
erals will be fresh from a Wednesday
match with Radford at Wilson Field
that Coach Joe Lyles calls a “must
win” situation,

Coach Lyles is looking forward to
the return of scoring leader Jamie
Veghte who was out of action last
week due to illness, Lyles hopes to
sce W&L's stagnated offense come to
life,

In last Friday's game against the
Bobeats, the West Virginians only
managed one goal against the Gen-
evals in the first half, The four goals
in the second half can be credited to
the experience of the Wesleyan
team, which includes no less than two
All-Americans, Coach Lyles said he
felt the young W&L squad played its
best game of the season,

Cross Country 4-2

By ONIL COTE

The General's intva-city rival Key
dets earned the boasting rights for
Lexington by finishing on the short
end of a 15-43 score against Wash-
ington and Lee in cross country com-
petition held last Saturday at V.M.I,

Fortunately, Coach Miller and his
cight runners found solace in the fact
that despite the lopsided defeat the
Generals did manage to squeeze by
Roanoke College and Norfolk State
by scores of 25-30 and 26-29, lifting
their slate to 4-2,

A solid but unspectacular record

Polo wins

In case you didn't know, Washing
ton and Lee has a horse polo club,
The horsemen opened their season
last Friday and Sunday with two wins
over the Woodlawn club of Wood-
lawn, Va. 8-3 and 10-3. There are 11
men on the club but only 8 can
play at a time, Captain Darnall Boyd
a sophomore, was the leading scores
for the Generals in their first two
matches scoring 9 goals in the two
games combined, The horsemen will
play U.Va. in their next match this
Sunday in Charlottesville at 2 p.m.

has been compiled by the Generals,
but it needs considerable improve-
ment if W&L wishes to be a promi
ment contender in the New England
Cross Country Championships to be
held in Massachusetts at the conclu-
sion of the regular season,

‘The match’s outcome was hardly
surprising considering that Keydet
runners finished with the five best
times, The efforts of Generals Jim
Frantz and Tem Washington (who
finished sixth and seventh) were de-
ciding factors in nosing out the Mar-
roons and the Spartans, but simply
were not enough to outclass V.M.L.,
Who seemingly fielded a quintet of
greyhounds to compete in the six
mile run,

Perhaps to a fess experienced team
the loss would be disillusioning and
would undermine the team morale
Which is so necessary for success. This
should not be the case with the Gen-
erals, however, who have been
through all this before and realize
they can redeem themseleves with a
song showing against Lynchburg
College and Virginia Wesleyan Col-
lege in next Saturday's meet,

event, withdrew from competition,

The RCTS is beginning its annual
membership drive this month, accord-
ing to Dr. William J. Watt, president.
Season subscriptions for all five per-
formances are $12 for adults, $8 for
college students, and $3 for elemen-
tary and high-school pupils.

The membership campaign pro
motes “Special Friend” memberships
in particular, Dr, Watt said — $35
for Sustaining Memberships, $50 for
Donors, and $100 for Patrons, Each
such “Special Friend” receives two
scason tickets, and the amount of the
contribution above the basic $24 tic-
ket cost is tax deductible. In addi-
tion, “Special Friends” are recogniz-
ed by name in the printed program
for each concert,

“Only through the generosity of
our ‘Special Friends’ and the = sub-
stantial help we receive from W&L
and V.M.I, can we keep costs so ex-
ceptionally low for everybody,” Dr.
Watt said, “but especially for school
children. The $3 season ticket for
them represents a cultural bargain
that L expect is unequalled anywhere
else.”
