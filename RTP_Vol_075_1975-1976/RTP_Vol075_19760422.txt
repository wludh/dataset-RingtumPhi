Springs Weekend features
four concerts -- one a day

By J. MICHAEL GALLAGHER

Has the “big Spring Weekend”
returned to W&L? That question
will be answered this weekend
by the number of people attend-
ing no less than four SAB-spon-
sored performances and one
junior grain party.

The SAB has spared no expense
in trying to satisfy the different
musical tastes that exist on
campus. The whole gala affair is
estimated to cost somewhere in
ihe area of $17,000. The bulk
of this sum is for the Spinners
concert, which opens at 8:00 p.m.
Friday with Lorie Jacobs, a

CAPITOL recording artist who
has been compared to Carol King.

After an intermission, the
Spinners will begin the first of
two 45 minute sets. There will be
a coneessions stand operated to
help kill time during the intermis-
sion. Friday’s night’s show will be
MCed by Tom Parks, a stand-up
comie who is well know in these
parts. Contrary to rumor, danc-
ing will be allowed during the
eoncert, as long as there is no
esatoring on the stage. Tickets are
$5.00 per person and may be
purchased in advance at the Stu-
dent Center, and at the door the
night of the show.

Zumwalt heads list
of political orators

Three leading Democrats will
deliver speeches in the next week
as part of the preparation for the
Mock Convention. The speakers
are: the retired Chief of Naval
Operations, Admiral Elmo Zum-

Student works
shown in duPont

A series of exhibitions of art by
Washington and Lee students, in-
cluding four separate one-man
shows, began this week with an
all-student show, which wil con-
tinue through May 1.

That exhibition will be followed
by the one-man shows, with works
by Kurt B. Kalfs from May 3
through May 8; Peyton Via, May
10-15; Brett Burkhart, May 17-22,
and John Dean, May 24-29. All
four are senior art majors.

The final exhibition will be a
joint show of works by all the
University’s senior art majors,
Those will be on view during
graduation week, May 31 through
June 4.

The exhibitions will take place
in duPont Gallery, and the pub-
lic is invited to visit each show.
The gallery is open weekdays
from 8 to 5.

walt, who has declared his ecandi-

dacy for the U.S. Senate from
Virginia; Louisiana Senator J.
Bennett Johnston; and Thomas

Reston, Secretary of the Virginia
Democratic Party. Zumwalt will
speak tomorrow and the other
two are scheduled for Wednesday,
April 28.

The three fresentations are
centered around the issues to be
debated on the floor during the
convention’s platform session.
“We want to give the students
a pre-convention forum to discuss
the issues,” said platform com-
mittee chairman Stuart Coco.
Coco says the three men were
chosen because, “they seem ‘o
dominate the news as spokesmen
for one side on the three lead-
ing issues, Defense, Domestic
Policy and Foreign Relations.”
Coco added, “take Zumwalt for
example he is running for
the Senate on a campaign stress-
ing ‘Defense Spending.’ We hope
the students will ask him what
kind of plank he wants in the
Democratic Platform and how Vir
ginia feels about the defense
issue.”

The Zumwalt address will be
held at the Alumni House at two
in the afternoon on Friday.

Viability of Christianity is topic
for three-day symposium here

Reconciling the historic Chris-
tian doctrine of the “universaliiy
of Christianity” with “the ineur-

able religious pluralism of the
world” will be the focus of a

three-day symposium this week-
end.

The program will bring leading
religious thinkers of the Buddhist,
Hindu, Jewish and Muslim tradi-
tions as well as Protstant and
Catholic Christians together for
a series of lectures, response ses-
sions, and special-topic seminars.

“All claims to (religious) uni-
versality (now) have to be re-
lated to the fact that no particular
religion will be the sole religion
of humankind,” according to Dr.
Donald G. Dawe, who will deliver
the opening address at the sym-
posium. Dr. Dawe is professor of
systematic theology at Union
Theological Seminary, Richmond.
Hiis remarks have been circulated
in advance to other participants
to allow them to formulate re-
sponses which will be delivered
at later points during the sym-
posium,

The program, Dr. Dawe ob-
serves in his introductory address
“ is part of the struggle to make
sense out of the Christian faith”
in light of twe seemingly con-

tradictory factors—the Biblical
direction to “go therefore and
make disciples of all nations”

(Matthew 28:19) on the one hand
and the 20th-century recognition
on the other hand that the non
Christian world “gives every evi
dence of remaining that way,”
and that the earlier aim of “the
universality of Christianity
the conversion of all people
is not to be the case.”

Platform procedures

Monday the Mock Convention
platform will be released. The
following article was prepared
by Stuart Coco, chairman of the
pleiform committee of the MC,
to explain the procedure in-
volved in drawing up the plat-
form and to present guidelines
for persons wishing to chal-
lenge the majority planks dur-
ing the convention.

The platform committee has
two purposes in its drafting of the
mock platform—to present issues
deemed important by the Demo-
cratic Party and to give due con
sideration to W&L student opin-
ion, The commitiee has researched
the issues to gain insight into the
Democratic Party's thinking on

vital issues. Balancing conserva
tive thought with moderate and
liberal ideas of the Party was

this committee's task
The W&L community will have

one more chance to inject its
wisdom into the platform. The
first came when the committee

conducted an opinion poll to a!
low the presentation of new issue
not being considered to date. The
adoption of the platform on Fri
day, May 7th, is the student's las!
opportunity te reconcile its form
with their own belief

Ethics lecture
set for Monday

“The Ethies of Behavior Modi-
fication” will be the topic of a
lecture by Dr. Harmon L. Smith
next Monday, April 6. He will
speak in duPont Auditorium at 8
p.m. Dr. Smith’s visit is spon-
sored by Society and the Profes-
sions, Washington and _ Lee’s
ethics program.

An ordained Episcopal minister,
Dr. Smith is professor of moral
theology in the Divinity School of
Duke University. He joined the
Duke faculty in 1962, after receiv-
ing his Ph.D. from that university.

In 1968-69, he studied under re-
search and study grants from the
Mary Biddle Foundation, the
“raerican Association of Theologi-
cc! Schools, and the Cooper Foun-
cation for Neurologic Research
and Education, carrying out re-
search in medicine and ethics
at the University of Edinburgh.
In 1973 he was invited to be
Humanities Research Fellow in
the Department of Neurologic
Surgery at St. Barnabas Hospital
in New York.

Dr. Smith has lectured through-
out the United States, and de-
livered a Philip Fullerton Hower-
ton lecture at W&L two years ago.
He has written several books, in-
cluding “The Christian and His
Decisions,” co-authored by Dr.
Louis W. Hodges, professor of
religion at Washington and Lee
and director of the ethics pro-
gram.

NOTICES

Petitions for candidacy to the
University Council are due in the
E.C. room by 7 p.m. Monday, April
26. Candidates should attend the
E.C. meeting at that time. Posi-
tions are open for three rising
seniors, two rising juniors, and
two rising sophomores.

The NBC-TV “Today” show fea-
ture segment “Notes on a Visit
to Robert E. Lee,” written and
narrated by George C. Scott and
initially aired April 9, will be
specially re-broadecast Thursday,
April 22, on Cable Nine in Lex-
ington during the 7:30 p.m. news.

explained

ed for pro and con speeches. The
plank is either accepted or de-
feated by a vote with no addi-
tional amendment allowed. New
planks may be presented from the
floor, after all Majority Planks
have been considered. The pro-
ponent moves to suspend the rules
to intreduce a plank from the
floor. The Chairman takes a vote
on the motion and it two-thirds of
the delegates approves, the plank
is presented with the same time
restrictions as the Minority Re-
port.

This procedure gives equal time
to each issue and ensures con-

cise, competent debates.

 

Scenes such as the one above are likely to be repeated many times
this weekend, what with two Pavilion parties among the festivities.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Spring, sunshine,
and vague guilt feelings

The vernal equinox passed virtually unnoticed by students
who were preoccupied with such weighty matters as winter
exams. But our return from far-flung retreats, where we
licked our academic wounds and restored our souls, has
brought with it the realization that spring is here, as our
Rockbridge residence basks in pseudo-tropical sunshine filter-
ing through the dogwood blossoms and maple leaves. This is
really Spring Term, oft spoken of wistfully in the autumn and
expectantly, fervently in the winter, Breakneck runs down
Devil's Kitchen, sublime afternoons in the stands at Wilson
Field, mid-week evenings spent in Manson and Tinker, and
of course an oceasional foray to The Hill for a smattering ol
academic enlightenment will fill our days.

Spring Term, a time for fun, frolic, and feminine compan-
ionship. A time where studies take a (deserved?) second place
in the priority of things. Professors realize this, and con-
centrate on vanquishing the back nine, raising cherry tomatoes,
and pondering deep thoughts from the seclusion of the back
patio, Classes, well classes take a back seat, because it's
obvious the students aren't going to hit the books either,

Road trips and tubing trips and liquor runs are fine, but
we doubt that that is the total picture as envisioned by the
Board of Trustees when the calendar was revamped six years
ago. Students were expected to take full academic advantage
of the term,

This is not to imply that no one does any work in April
and May. On the contrary, certain departments offer challeng-
ing courses that exploit the opportunities available in the short
term. A number of courses are augmented with field observa-
tions: others consist of in-depth seminars made possible by
the lighter class schedules. Many departments, however, have
failed to fully appreciate the advantages o fthe Spring Term.
Rather than developing new courses or new approaches to old
courses, they rely on old courses taught with old methods in
half the normal time. All of the course material gets crammed
into six weeks, but we have the sneaking suspicion that the
impact of the subject has been lessened.

Spring Term was originally designed to be a time of de-
velopment and fulfillment for the individual student. With his
“standard” courses behind him, he was to be able to engage in
extensive research in one or two specific areas of interest to
him. For the most part this has failed to occur. In the transi-
tional year to the new schedule students found the springtime
to be great for development and fulfillment of their extra-
curricular lives, By the time new courses were added, the
notion of the Fun Term had been established. Now students
flock to courses offered in the spring that seem to offer en-
joyment and an easy work load, unless forced by requirements
to take a course in their field of concentration,

We like the term the way it now exists—it softens the
long-range effects of the devasting winter term, particularly
in vears when that term consist of twelve straight weeks of
classes with no pause. Professors like the current arrangement
too, for it gives them time for a little self-fulfillment (what-
ever that is). But deep down we feel slightly guilty, when for
forty-two days we sally forth to class so infrequently, but
have so many good times in the interim.

Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

I am an avid reader of your
weekly publication and anxiously
await every Thursday for the new
issue which I contemplate medita-
tively over a chicken breast patty
and about five small coffees. Such
ritualistic sessions with your news-
paper help dull by senses, and for
a brief hypnotic moment the rig-
orous demands of life et al are
effectively tuned out.

| was particularly tickled by the
\pril first issue, Upon reading the
headlines on page one, I made
prompt plans to pack my bags and
begin my spring vacation. My
plans were crudely aborted, how-
ever, when, reading “The Sylla-
bus.” 1 was reminded it was April
Fool's Day. I slapped my fore-
head in disbelief at my moment-
ary lack of perspicuity and pro-
ceeded to ponder the rest of the
print, amused by the catchy
phrasing of the articles, e.g. “Hol-
lins volunteers for intercourse.” I
cleared the saliva with another
cup of coffee and turned the page.

As is my custom, I focused my
attention at first on the letters to
the Editor. Mr. T. Michael Stritch’s
perturbing apologetic retrospect

down my spine in a rare moment
of self-awareness. But I was graci-
ously mollified by your editorial
and your sound responses to both
Mr. Stritch’s and Mr. Hinely’s
letters. You're right. Anarchy (as
it is defined in academic circles)
has no place in our beloved and
orderly oasis. And if we are not
fully satisfied by the way in which
our money is being used, why
should we get all boiled over? It
only sours the grapes. The best
course of action is to leave com-
plicated economics to those who
are competent and sink back
into our blind serenity. Further-
more, the S.A.B. members are
certainly not worms. They are
bonifide human beings equipped
with brains, and even if they
neglect to use them, they are
after all appointed by the E.C.
which (and your point is well
taken) is elected by the student
body.

Similar to Mr, Stritch, | am ad-
dressing myself to a far broader
issue than, say, Mr. Hinely’s
vision of what the S.A.B. mem-
bers look like. I want to thank
you, Mr. Editor, for your share
in squashing the bitching around

Notes on Robert E. Lee

This essay was written by
George C. Scott, the Academy
Award-winning actor who is also
a serious Robert E. Lee scholar.
“Notes on a Visit to Robert E.
Lee” was developed as a feature
scheduled for broadcast by
NBC-TV on the “Today” show
April 9. Most of the filming
was done on the campus of
Washington and Lee; Lee was
president of the institution
(then Washington College) from
1865 until his death in 1870.
Mr. Scott gave Washington and
Lee permission to reproduce his
remarkable script.

By GEORGE C. SCOTT

This is Main Street, Lexington,
Virginia. On Sept. 19, 1865, a big,
sandy horse with a dark mane and
tail strode effortlessly down this
street. He carried a tall, stooped
man with a pearl-white beard who

might have been taken for a
farmer—the muddy boots, the
faded, literally colorless riding
coat, the sweat-brown,  broad-
brimmed hat.

But he was not an ordinary
citizen bent on some mundane
domestic chore. Neither ordinary
—nor a citizen.

.,. On that pleasant fall morn-
ing, 11 years before America
would celebrate her Centennial
year, R. E. Lee was about to be-
come president.

Obviously, and some say un-
happily, the presidency was not
that of the United States. Rather,
it was as chief administrator of
tiny, impoverished Washington
College that Lee had come to
serve.

He was a paroled prisoner of
war under indictment for high
treason. Reviled by many as the

Dick Pinney’s songs:

not all are melancholic

By PAUL CHASTAIN

Dick Pinney can steal a show
as a warmup performer for a
more highly-billed artist—and this
is documented fact, according to
a story he relates. He tells his
audience of how, with limited
repertoire, he once played intro-
duction to a Tennessee celebrity
in Murfreesboro and unwittingly
picked one of that celebrity's
compositions as an encore when
the star was late.

“When the guy came on he
played the same song and the
audience started laughing—like,
saying ‘Why are you playing a
Dick Pinney song?’” he says, and
adds “Wish I'd known whose song
it was.”

The song is about coal mining
and the tough-and-tender life of
blue collar workers. After hear-
ing it and others in Pinney’s pres-
ent repertoire one ceases to share
the other audience's surprise that
an artist would want to commit
some Pinney to his own memory,
for Dick Pinney’s music is highly
entertaining and he has a sensi-
tivity which makes any song—
gruff, melancholy, humorous—
appealing. Just as important, his
work is technically flawless (that
is, when he is not distracted by
the ever-present noise in the Cock-
pit).

Pinney’s main thrust lies in
songs of melancholy and of people
caught in situations from which
they would love to escape, but
he does not limit himself to a
cause: probably the most sensitive
of his work, as is the case with
most musicians these days, he
gives us through self-exploration.
Although for many this path
would lead to trite exasperation,
Mr. Pinney writes poignantly of
his own purpose—“You may know
me when I have been blessed /
When I give you some and move
on/And I will leave in jubilation
And have you returning for some
more”—and of his own doubts
and self-sortings. In a particularly

 

expressive song, facetiously titled
“You Only Love Me When You're
Drunk,” he explores the pain of
and reluctant release from in-
fatuation. The impact of the song
is heightened when he cracks be-
forehand that he “bets he has
sympathizers on this one” and
elicits a few guffaws.

But Pinney is not all intro-
spection. He sings “Blues My
Sweetie Gave to Me” and other
songs about evil women, direct-
ing a few appropriate remarks at
Roanoke (he calls the town his
pinky toe on his left foot.) He
does an imitation of Merle Hag-
gard in “Door Number Three,”
which he dedicates to Monty Hall,
and his rendition of Sesame
Street's “Song of the National
Association of W-Lovers” is edify-
ing.

Pinney’s remaining perform-
ances in the Cockpit are: Thurs-
day, 5:15 and 7:00; Friday, 4:00,
5:30 and 7:00, and Saturday, 7:00,
9:00, and 10:30.

Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

This letter concerns the con-
troversy of the final decision to
bring The Spinners to W&L. As
Bobby Pugh stated, he wanted to
spend his spring weekend at W&L,
instead of going to U.Va. two
days later to see them. He failed
to understand two-thirds of the
student body (my estimate) will
not now have a spring weekend
concert anywhere, As the political
power structure now stands alone
in Red Square, the student body
of W&L will not be represented
by the present self-serving E.C.
This problem is only our fault
and our fault alone for not run-
ning for office, let this be a lesson

My two suggestions: one, that
in the future more representative
students should run for E.C., and

secondly, that the S.A.B. should
be an elected office instead of a
sub-power of the E.C,

either to vote or to hold any

But he was also beloved to the
point of mythology by millions
of his countrymen — and among
these were the trustees of Wash-

the trainfare and a suit of clothes
to send Judge J. W. Brocken-

of president and an annual salary
of $1,500.

years were waning. But he wanted
desperately to be of use to what
he always termed the “rising”
generation of his country. And
when Judge Brockenbrough insist-
ed that his acceptance would
“evince a mind superior to de-
spair,” he gratefully agreed.

About the only recreation Presi-
dent Lee enjoyed during those
last few years was taking daily
rides through the sourrounding
countryside on that great grey
horse, Traveller. One of the places
he visited frequently was the hill-
side gravesite of Thomas J.
“Stonewall” Jackson.

Prior to the war, Jackson had
been a professor at nearby Vir-
ginia Military Institute. Lee
probably stood at that grave and
spoke quietly to his eccentric,
strait-laced old comrade. Jack-
son, even to this day internation-
ally recognized as one of the
profound tactical geniuses of all
time, was known to some of his
men as “School Marm.”

And Lee probably joked softly
with him that they were both
school marms now.

Undoubtedly, since they were
religious men, Lee knelt here and
prayed for both their souls. And
he probably assured “Stonewall”
that they would be united again
before very long.

But bitterness and morbidity
were foreign to Lee’s nature. And
so was looking backwards. He
worked diligently, even in rapidly
failing health, and the college
prospered—three days after his

death becoming Washington and
Lee University.

... At breakfact with his son
Robert on the morning of his
murder, Abraham Lincoln looked
at a portrait of Robert E. Lee and
said, “It is a good face. I am
glad the war is over at last.”

It was indeed a good face. Was
it not — indeed, is it not still —
the face of a good man?

Edward Valentine, who had
sculpted a likeness of Lee from
life, said: “An artist, above all
other men, is quick to observe
the faintest suggestion of posing.
The slightest indication of move-
ment or expression that smacks
of vanity, he is sure to detect.
Such weaknesses (which, as far
as I know, are shared by many
who are called great ones of
the world) were totally lacking
in General Lee.”

This is Bicentennial America.

This is Election-Year America.

This is 20th-century, thermo-
nuclear, porno-liberated, cokey-
alky, oligarchy, In-order-to-get-
I-gotta-grind-you America.

What are you and I supposed
to learn from or feel about the
world and the character of a man
like R. E. Lee?

He’s cold. We're cool.

He’s passe. We’re avant.

He’s out of it. We’re up to here
in it.

Well, there are a few qualities
this remarkable creature had
which may serve us too, if we
consider them.

Patience — quiet good humor
— adoration of children — loy-
alty — respect for had work —
dedication to an ideal — love of
animals — appreciation of duly
constituted authority coupled
with an abhorrence of authori-
tarianism — a devotion to his-
tory, for, as General Lee said,
“It is history that teaches hope”
— gentleness and the aspiration
to achieve gentlemanliness —
understanding of the state of
being young — courtesy toward
the conditional frailty of ad-
vanced age.

Acceptance of responsibility.
Personal integrity.

 

Platform: our two

will be presented right on sched-
ule and the average student on
the street can finally start to put
his two cents worth into the mas-
sive budget of the MC.

The platform that will be re-
leased is an ideologically mod-
erate affair, according to Stuart
Coco, chairman of the committee
that formulated it. It is an at-
tempt to “reconcile the Demo-
cratic view with the conservative
campus,” Coco said. The import-
ance of the platform in the larger
scheme of things depends on how
far the stuednts not on the com-
mittee want to continue the pro-
cess of reconciliation.

The committee that worked on
the platform includes: Bill Shel-
ton, Bill Kerr, Buster Briggs,
Chris Haynes, Chris Willet, James
Mallory, and Debbie Higgins. The
views represented on that com-
mittee range from Republican to
Hollins. The views that are added
depend on how many minority
planks are presented in accord.
ance with the regulations that will
hopefully be printed on the front
page of this issue.

Presenting a minority plank
does not mean going after your
ideological opponent with a two-

cents...

by-four. It has something to do
with drawing up a statement in
opposition to the majority plank,
the one in the official platform,
and turning it in to the steering
committee in time to ge an ap-
pointment to debate the issue at
the convention. The top honchos
in the MC offices are hoping that
several minority planks will be
presented since the debate and
rhetoric on the issues will be one
of the high points of the conven-
tion. According to past MC litera-
ture, the platform is the area
where student opinion gets its
expression in the convention, Un-
like the actual nomination, the
platform is designed to reflect stu-
dent thoughts on the ideas of the
day, not what the Democratic
party is expected to do.

Both the steering committee
and the Ring-tum Phi are advis-
ing any and all students to turn
in alternatives to the views put
forth in next week’s platform. The
steering committee wants them to
provide debate and excitement at
them to give the people covering
the convention somethin gto write
the convention. The paper wants
about besides how much alcohol
is consumed on the floor.

Generals bow to Hofstra;
then whip. C. W. Post

By BILL FLESHER
Washington and Lee’s sudden
lack of offense in the second half
against Hofstra probably cost the
Generals a chance at getting back
into the top eight in this week’s
United States Intercollegiate La-
crosse Association (USILA) poll.
After leading twice by five goals
in the first half (5-0 and 6-1),
W&L scored just one in the final
30 minutes while the Flying
Dutchmen rallied for a 10-7 win.
The Generals gained a split on
their Spring trip Saturday when
they downed C.W. Post, 13-6, de-
spite the fact that five of W&L’s
top ten midfielders did not dress
because of a curfew violation.
The Hofstra loss dropped the
Generals, 5-3, to tenth in this
week’s USILA rankings. A win

TRACK

The track team received sev-
eral outstanding individual per-
formances during a trip South
last week, but was unable to im-
prove on its team won-loss rec-
ord. The Generals placed 17th of
24 schools in the Davidson Relays
and dropped an 85-60 dual meet
to Campbell College.

Senior Mike Burns was a double
winner against Campbell, winning
both the mile and _ three-mile.
Freshman Norvell Scott was sec-
ond in both the long jump and
440 hurdles and third in the high
hurdles. Soph speedster Ray Scott
posted a 10.0 in finishing second
in the 100-yard dash, and team-
mate Larry Banks was just a
tenth of a second later.

The Generals swept the three-
mile, with Burns, Tom Washing-
ton and Jim Frantz going 1-2-3,
and also swept the high hurdles
with Hix Green the winner in
:15.6, Tony Perry second and
Norvell Scott third.

In the Davidson Relays, senior
Jack Berry tossed the javelin 176
feet, 15 inches for a fifth-place
finish; the sprint relay team
placed fourth, and Norvell Scott
long jumped 22 feet, 4!5 inches.

Jerry Maatman fired a 150 to
lead the golf team to a fourth
place finish in the Virginia Col-
lege Athletic Association (VCAA)

Hampden-Sydney won the over-
all team title with a blazing 599

Randolph-Macon 632, George Ma-
son 642, Roanoke 646, Bridgewater

Hampden-Sydney’s Dave An

POLO

The Washington and Lee Polo
Club will open an ambitious
spring home schedule on Sunday
afternoon the 25th of April at the

is 3 p.m. Admission is $1.00 for
adults and college students
Children will be admitted for 50¢

During this 1975-76 school year
the team has achieved a record of
two wins and three losses. The
only home game produced a loss
at the hands of the Woodlawn
Polo Club, a team Washington and
Lee had beaten twice earlier in

over the Flying Dutchmen might

have moved W&L as high 1s

seventh, since both Penn and

Brown lost over the weekend.
The week in review:

For a while last Wednesday, it
looked like the two-week layoff
hadn’t affected the Generals in the
least.

W&L jumped to a quick lead
when Donny Carroll scored with
47 seconds gone in the opening
quarter, then increased that lead
to 4-0 on goals by Rob Morgan,
Tom Keigler, and Chris Kearney.

Kearney’s second goal midway
through the second period gave
the Generals a 5-0 lead. After
Tom Rogener put Hofstra on the
board, Morgan picked up his sec-
ond goal to again give W&L a
five-goal lead.

Then the roof fell \n on the
Generals. Paul Mejia and Bill
Burton got two quick goals for
the Flying Dutchmen before half-
time to cut the W&L lead to 6-3.

It stayed that way until midway
through the third period, when
Hiofstra scored three times within
90 seconds to tie the game at 6-6.

The Flying Dutchmen took their
first lead with 2:04 left in the
quarter as Ron Taylor scored his
second goal. W&L’s Jay Sindler
tied the game again with 27 sec-
onds left, but Rich Stoecker’s
second goal just ten seconds later
put Hofstra in front for good.

Fourth quarter goals by Bob
Hiller and Stoecker were all the
Flying Dutchmen needed to put
the game out of reach of the
Generals, who managed just eight
shots on goal in the second half.

W&L goalie Charlie Brown, who
looked at 70 Hofstra shots, came
up with a season-high 27 saves.
The Generals, meanwhile, were
able to get off just 28 shots for

the entire game.

W&L bounced back three days
later to easily handle C.W. Post
even though the Generals played
without half of their top mid-
fielders.

W&L head coach Jack Emmer
suspended middies Charlie Stieff,
Jay Sindler, Brian Tray, Bob Flan-
nery, and Jim Brooks for one
game because of a curfew viola-
tion committed during the trip.

The Generals got off to a slug-
gish start, taking a 2-1 lead after
one period on goals by Morgan
and Kearney.

W&L took command in the sec-
ond quarter, with Jack Dudley,
Chris Larson, Jeff Fritz, John
Black, and Kearney scoring be-

What do football players Tom
Glassie and Scott Gardner of Vir-
ginia, Ronnie Moore of VMI, Phil
Rogers of Virginia Tech, and Jack
Berry of Washington and Lee have
in common?

They were all drafted in the
professional leagues.

Berry, the quarterback who set
all kinds of passing records at
W&L, was chosen in the 17th
round by Tampa Bay, the new ex-
pansion team in the National Foot-
ball League.

In his college career at W&L,
the Madison, Va. senior completed
369 passes for 4,299 yards and 27
touchdowns. That’s roughly two-
and-a-half miles.

WEL favored in VCAA
tennis tournament here

By JOHN HUGHES

Host Washington and Lee is the
favorite to win the fourth annual
Virginia College Athletic Associa-
tion (VCAA) tennis tournament
here this weekend.

Defending champion Hampton
Institute elected not to compete

this year, thus giving the fa-
vorite’s role to the runner-up
Generals, whose strongest com-

petition is expected to come from
Emory & Henry and Hampden-
Sydney.

Five other teams are entered
and could surprise the favorites:
Madison, George Mason, Bridge-
water, Eastern Mennonite and
Randolph-Macon.

W&L, with an 86 record going
into a pair of matches this week,
is paced by Ben Jones at no. 1
singles, Don Caffery at no. 2 and
Jim Fisher at no. 3, and they all
made the finals last year. Johns
and Caffery have 12-2 records,

along with Ken Voelker at no. 4
and Rob Smith at no. 6, while
Fisher has an 11-3 record and no.
5 Robert Wilson is 9-5.

Their strongest competition is
expected to come from Emory &
Henry's Tom Glenn, who is 15-7
at no. 1, and Rich Rhudy, 20-4 at
no. 2, along with Hampcen-Syd-
ney’s no. 1 player, lan Valentine,
who lost to Johns at no. 3 in last
year’s VCAA championship.

The tournament will get under
way on W&L’s new asphalt courts
at 2:00 p.m. Friday. Finals are set
for Saturday afternoon, with Sun-
day a back-up dav in case of
rain.

In their most recent action, the
Generals won two of three
matches in the New Orleans area
during a spring vacation trip last
week, defeating LSU-New Orleans
7-2 and Southeastern Louisiana
6-3, and dropping a 7-2 verdict to
strong Tulane.

Action close to the goal in one of the Generals’ two games during their spring trip. The lacrosse team

lost to Hofstra but broke even on the pair of games by defeating C.W. Post.

Jack Berry drafted by Tampa Bay

immediately for comment. Earlier
he had said he would like to
“give it a try” in the pros if
he were drafted.

“But I realize the pros take only
the top two or three quarterbacks
in the country each year, so I’m
making sure I have other plans
next year,” Berry said. A top stu-
dent, Berry’s alternate plans in-
clude teaching or law school.

Berry attracted numerous pro
scouts because of his size (6-3,
195), speed( he’s been clocked in
the 40-yard dash in 4.7 seconds)
and his ability to set up quickly
and throw deeply with something
on the ball.

Berry captained the football
team in both his junior and senior
years, and presently is a captain
on the track team. He’s a dean’s

Zumwalt, Johnston, and Reston
speak on principal platform issues

(Continued trom page 1)

The 55 year-old Zumwalt is a
native of California. He attended
the U. S. Naval Academy and
served in World War UI, where he
received four war metals. He was
commander of the U. S. Naval
Forces in Vietnam from 1968-70.
During that time he became a
leading aide for President Nixon
and Henry Kissinger.

Since his retirement Zumwalt’s
interests have turned to Virginia
politics. In his first bid for an
clected office, Zumwalt will try to
unseat Virginia senior Senator
Harry Bryd, Jr., an Independent.

Senator Johnston will speak tn
Lee Chapel at 7:30 p.m. on
Wednesday. Johnston will talk
about ‘Domestic Policies, speci-
fically the problems the country
faces in energy, urban problems
and revenue sharing.

Johnston won election to the
Senate in November of 1972 and
is reported to be one of the most
conservative Senators in Wash-
ington. If one were looking for
the young Senators likely to carry
on the tradition established by
Southern Democrats like Richard
Russell, John Stennis and John
McClellan, few could top Johns-
ton.

Johnston was named in a Time
magazine national survey as one
of the nation’s future leaders—a
selection which included only 11
other Senators. He was also
singled out to serve on the power
ful Appzopriations Committee,
and was tapped by the Senate
Democratic Caucus to chair the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee.

Enrico Dell ’Osso
No steps will be taken to alter

an effort was made in Novem-
ber, but the faculty declined to
act. Hopefully a more sensible
schedule for 1977-1978 will be
decided upon next autumn. The
calendar for the coming year is
a disaster, as we have mention-
ed before on this page, but un-
fortunately the faculty wants to
wait and see just how disastr-
ous.

Tax reform urged
Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

Another April 15 has come and
gone, and once more some 40
million Americans were hit with
an income tax penalty of up to
20% because they happen to be
single (including many who are
widowed, divorced, students, mili-
tary, etc.). To end this tax rip-off,
Rep. Edward Koch (D-NY) has in-
troduced HR 850 in the House
Ways and Means Committee, to
establish the tax table currently
used by married persons filling
joint returns as the tax table io
be used by ALL taxpayers. This
bill would ALSO remove tax in-
equities from married couples who
both work.

More information about HR 850
may be obtained by sending a
stamped, self-addressed No. 10
envelope to CO$T—The Commit-
tee of Single Taxpayers, 1628 21st
