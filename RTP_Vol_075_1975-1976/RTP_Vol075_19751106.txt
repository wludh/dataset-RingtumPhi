REVIEW andOUTLOOK ‘The old Hotel Robert E. Lee:

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Thursday, November 6, 1975

Mid-winter break:
schedule it in March?

\t its monthly meeting on Monday the faculty tabled vot-
ing on the proposed calendar for 1976-77 until its December
meeting. The University Council had requested such action ;
the schedule contains two changes which we feel students
hould know about before the final vote is taken.

For one, as it now stands the Christmas Holiday would
extend for little over two weeks, rather than the normal three
break. Unfortunately this to keep

appears

happens to fall on September 6 next year. As compensation for
the shortened Christmas break, there will be two weeks be
tween Thanksgiving and the start of examinations, giving stu
dents more time to prepare (with the inclusion of a weekend
between the late November vacation and the onslaught of
linals).

What bothers us much more than the foreshortened De-
cember holiday is the placement of the so-called Washington
Holiday

We are not enthusiastic about the inclusion of a full week's

tant scheduling of Commencement exercises and possibly
classes in June places students seeking summer employment at

it
an undue disadvantage. But if we are to have a break in the
term, it should occur at a reasonable time, most logically im
mediately after mid-term exams.

We fail to see the advantage in postponing the vacation
until early Mareh. The January-February doldrums remain un-
broken, skiing opportunities are missed, and students do not
receive a much-needed respite after encountering mid-terms.

Proponents of the change argue that a later break allows
students time to relax before the final “term-paper rush”, that
the Winter Term does not need a recess smack-dab in the
middle. Apparently the move is strongly supported by the
\thletie Department, but even that influence should not out-
weigh the fact that the break was incorporated into the calen-
dar to allow students to escape for a few days in the winter.

Phe faculty delayed action on the proposal in order to give

tudents time to air their views. We encourage persons with

trong feelings on the subject to discuss the calendar with a

faculty member, or to contact the Ring-tum Phi, The faculty

is viving us the opportunity to make our views on their ac

tions known, Let’s not disappoint them.
