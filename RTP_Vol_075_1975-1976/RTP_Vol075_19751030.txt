McCullough: his views
on honor, co-education

By PAUL MORELLA
Managing [Editor

\ number of important issues have

been cropping up on campus re-
cently—issues that affect every mem-
ber of the student body, Of course

there are the usual topics of dis-
cussion such as the honor system and
the prospect of coeducation, but
SABU-SAB situation, the fraternity
crisis, and a new student newspaper
have also been added to the list.

Although these issues are almost
virtually unrelated, they all do have
one thing in common they all
coalesce around the Executive Com-
mittee of Washington and Lee,

The person in charge of the EC
is student body president Leland Me-
Cullough, who recently expounded
upon his feelings in relation to the
many that confront the stu-
dent body,

The Politics-Spanish major who is
eventually planning to attend law
school has thus far successfully met
the vast contingency of challenges
that the oflice of president presents,

“I found myself very apprehensive
at first,” said McCullough, “and I
didn't know how easily problems
would crop up, In any case, I don't
regret having run for the office,

“The Executive Committee deti-
nitely has its problems,” said = Me-
Cullough, “but the thing that
keeps me extremely optimistic is the
fact that everyone on this commitice
works together very well. We accept
each other's criticisms, but at the
same time we work together to help

issucs

one

solve all problems in the best in-
terests of the student body.”
In an interview, McCullough ex

pressed his views on the honor sys-
tem, coeducation and the more cur-
rent problems that the EC has been
confronted with.

He feels that this year the honor
system is stronger than before.
“We decided not to bring up any
first semester polls on the honoi
system because the whole debate can

be very confusing, especially to fresh-

evel

men. We feel that freshmen will
understand the system better if the
whole talk of change doesn't come

up too carly,

“When the students hear

dents is another reason why it still
remains effective,”

“Furthermore, we

Tn any event, of coeduca-
tion is one that is more susceptible
to radical change. As McCullough
suid, “We've been more or less in-
clined to let a sleeping dog lie and
it’s time we polled the student body
on their views,”

One of the ideas for this year's
poll is to bring the poll to the stu-
dents rather than have the students

ever, they are also exploring the issue

that whenever they do make a de-

McCullough also spoke on his feel-

and are causing a widespread debate
among members of the student body,
“The current fraternity situation
is more serious than a lot of people

“The board of trustees has called

One of the things the EC has done
is to climinate all the Red Square

grain parties. MeCullough said that
this decision was reached by the
houses in the square as well as the

EC and would be a big step in help-
ing to ease the present situation.

“One thing the alumni don’t think
about,’ stated McCullough, “is the
fact that some of them also tore the

In conclusion McCullough urged
more students to attend the EC mect-

definitely appreciate the student body

Generals fall to
Sewanee, 13-3

By KEN MASTRILLI
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee's football
team has yet to win a game, Two
costly penalties Saturday proved dis-
astrous for the Generals as they
dropped a 13-3 decision to University
of the South, at Sewanee, The loss
lowers the Generals record to 0-5-1.

Trailing 7-0 late in the second
quarter, General defensive back Jack
Norberg intercepted a pass and re-
turned it 10 yards to the Sewanee
38 yard line, The Generals then
drove to the one yard line despite a
clipping penalty and an illegal mo-
tion infraction, A penalty for hav

Despite the loss, Coach MeHenry
said it was the team’s best effort of
the year. The offensive line perform-
ed much better than in previous
weeks and enabled the Generals to
move the ball consistently on the
ground for the first time this sea-
son, Sophomore running back Ed
Johnson gained 96 yards on 19 car-
ries, by far the best ground gaining
effort by any W&L back all year. Ed
was named the offensive player of
the week by the coaching staff and
deservedly so, Johnson has worked
very hard to get a starting position
and makes the best out of every op-
portunity he gets to help the team,

But what hurt the Generals the
most were the costly errors at critical
moments in the ball game, The Gen-
erals were penalized a total of 120
yards for the game. Defensively, the
Generals were equal to the task most
of the time. Momentary lapses are
bound to happen when the defense

time, They kept W&L in the ball
game and gave the offense numerous
opportunities to catch up. Sewanee’s
offense gained 223 yards rushing and
127 passing.

Leading the Generals on defense
was sophomore Jeff Slatcoff who re-
corded a phenomenal 28 tackles and
Slatcoff leads the team in
tackles and assists for the year, For
the third time in six games he was
named defensive player of the game.

By RYLAND OWEN

A much-inspired W&L soccer team

Roanoke College last Wednesday and
days later nearly upset the

In the game against Roanoke the
Generals spent the better part of
the afternoon in front of the Roa-
noke goal, scoring five times and
outshooting the visiting team 31-14.
In the first half W&L got goals from
Jamey Veghte, Mike Monahan, Bill
Cogar, and Mark Derbyshire. Fresh-
man ‘Todd ‘Tyson added the fifth
goal in the second half. Goalie Mark
Bennett registered 15 saves for the
Generals,

Playing under the lights at Madi-
son the Generals came up with thei
best game to date. The Dukes were
shut out in the first half but man-
aged to score midway through the
second half and then held off W&L
for the remainder of the game. The
Generals’ defense, led by fullback
Jeff Barr and Greer Barrioult, played
an inspired game and repeatedly
broke up scoring threats from Madi-
son's potent front line, Bennett play-
ed a superb game in the nets, allow-
ing only one goal and finishing the
game with 23° saves.

managed 22 shots at the goal, many

just missing the corners, but were
unable to score.
‘The Generals, now holding a 2-8

record, round out their season with
away games at the Naval Academy
