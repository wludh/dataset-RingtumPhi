Fancy Dress Weekend arrives;
University braces for hangover

By Robert Lutz,

News Editor

“A Salute to Hollywood,” the
1976 Fancy Dress Ball, climaxes
Washington and Lee’s 69th near-
annual monster party weekend
tomorrow night during what S.A.-
B. co-chairperson Terry Atwood
indicates will be two or three of
the best days this University has
ever seen.

The action gets under way to-
nite from 9 to 1 in the simply yet
elegantly decorated Zollman’s
Pavillion, where those inclined to
get a jump on the weekend may

sway to the soulful sounds of the
Marvelettes. Liquor, mixers, ice,
cups and such are solely the re-
sponsibility of the individual par-
tygoer and will not be available
otherwise. Students are reminded
that admission to this event is in-
cluded in the $10 advance ticket
price.

The real excitement, however,
begins Friday evening at 8:30
when the stately doors of Fairfax
Lounge (the only official entrance
and exit), graced by a flashing
Hollywood-type theater marquee,
open wide to admit the first lucky

couple as they sweep into the foy-
er. Hopefully, the first and all gen-
tlemen attending will display the
proper attire of black tie (tuxe-
do or dinner jacket, for the hope-
lessly naive) ,if not, the burly and
altogether unpleasant doorman
may be tempted to violence.
Lexington’s dazzling, youthful
socialities will believe themselves
somehow magically transported to
“the glamorous world of Tinsel-
town” as they explore the cleverly
renovated Early-Fielding Student
Center. After pausing to consider
the opportunity to preserve their

Co-ed business program planned

By BOB CHIAVIELLO

The Summer Institute for Ca-
reers in Business will open its
doors for the first time here at
Washington and Lee to assist to-
day’s college student in making
the transition from the classroom
to the business world.

The intensive 27-day program is
aimed at college juniors and gra-
duating seniors who plan on mak-
ing a career in business. The In-
stitute is coeducational and open
to men and women who have not
had any previous business train
ing.

The Summer Institute’s curricu-
lum is designed to utilize and fo-
cus the skills already developed
through a training in the liberal
arts, sciences, or engineering, and
integrating them into the busi-
ness world.

The curriculum is modeled af-
ter the W&L program in business
administration. The course will be
conducted through formal teach-
ing sessions, seminars, and work-
shops, where the student will
learn about the American business
system and the vocabulary and
fundamentals of business admini-
stration.

In addition to the formal in-
struction and the practical ap-
plication of business principles,
students will have the opportunity

     
    

to meet informally with practicing
business executives.

There will be no formal exami-
nations, but the student will be
able to make self-evaluations
through informal meetings with
the faculty.

At the end of the program a
certificate will be presented by
W&L signifying the successful
completion of the Summer
stitute. No college credit wil
given.

The total cost of
will be $875 which wi
instructional fees,
board, refreshments,

take their meals at
Center. Included in t

for a minimum of 50g

was painted with the aid of a ladder borrowed from the Mainten-
ance Building, lending support to the theory that the painter was

a student, staff, or faculty member. The statue will be repainted

after Fancy Dress, at a cost to the University of around $150

The Fall and Rise of Fancy Dress

By FRITZ GOLDBERG

Open windows in the middle of
February were not enough. Evans
Dining Hall still flowed with sweat
and beer during last year’s Fancy
Dress Ball. The cafeteria was so
packed with human bodies that a
person on the wrong end of the
room had to go out the door and
around the block to find a bath-
room.

An indication of the size was
the fact that at least ten marshalls
had to be hired to try and enforce

the alcohol rules laid down by
our friends and yours, Virginia

Alcoholic Beverage Control Board.
An indication of the marshalls’
success was the fact that by the
end ef the evening most of them
were more inebriated, that is,
sloshed to the bitter max, than
the people they were supposed to
be controlling.

Whether Fancy Dress ‘76 will
be a repeat of last year’s suecess
still remains to be seen. If the
Ball does not live up to the 1975
standards, the SAB can always
claim suecess by pointing further
into the past than last year, and
comparing its efforts to the works
of its predecessor, the Dance
3oard. in the early years of this
same decade.

As late as 1968, the Fancy Dress
brouhaha was still alive and well.

and W&L was still, if one can
judge from the outward signs, a

bastion of traditional gentlemanli-
ness: the kind of gentlemanliness
that led the editor on the Friday
Ring-tum Phi (we were semi-
weekly back then) to rise his
editorial voice in protest of allow-
ing students to attend fraternity
parties without dates.

Those were the days, we sup-
pose. But the traditional air was
already starting to become be-
fouled by the onslaught of the

Spirit of ‘68, a movement that
ran from psychedelia to peace
marches to bitter cynicism, and

left behind it an American col-
lege scene that would never be
the same, except in Lexington.
But we are here to talk of
dance ;, not disillusionment, so let
us go back to January 10, 1969,
when the Ring-tum Phi announced

the plans for the forthcoming
Fane. Dress. At that time the
forma! ball was held on Friday
nigit. the same as the present

tradition, but the informal danee
came on the Saturday after the
ball, not the Thursday before. Per-
haps the ones who came before
us weve more in favor of getting
things over with (hence the cele
bration after the fact) whereas
we are more attuned to prepar-

Carter

By PHILIP HATCHETT

If vou listen to the eleven
candidates now centered in New
England, one is quickly taken at
the number of ways each dis
claims his alliance with political

power, tenures in Washington, or
past political accomplishments.
They seem to say through no

political knowledge can glory be
restored to Americans. As David
Broder said in Lee Chapel this
past fall. “This is the year of the
non-candidate.”

The map who has engineered
this approach most successfully ts
the Southern peanut § grower,
Jimmy Carter

The Carter campaign is selling
America on a man who has never
lived or worked in the Nation's
capital, and therefore (according
to aides) has not been corrupted
by the power struggles of the
bureaucracy nor owes or earns
political favors. Carter is a man
who claims to be honest, open and
compassionate on page two of his
brochure, and says on page three
‘Being President of the United
States is not the most important
thing in the world to me

The man from Plains, Georgia

Fancy Dress ’69 had one theme
for Friday night and another for
Saturday night. Friday’s formal
was an “Inauguration Ball.” Rich-
ard Nixon was being sworn in
around that time but Fancy Dress
was not that relevant. The ball
saluted President Huntley, who
was new to his job at the time.
The “relevance” came on Satur-
day when the theme was ‘“Love-
in 69.” A Ring-tum Phi headline

spoke of a “light show” and
“psychedelic music.” And if we

can believe the Ring-tum Phi edi-
torial that followed the events,
the love-in came off with all the
peace, love, flowers, sunshine and
disorganization that would become

a

an official mainstay of the Wood-
stock nation seven months later.

The concert on Saturday start-
ed at 8:20. The doors were opened
at 8. The concert was announced
as starting at 8. Many couples left
after the first band. No one told
them there would be a second
band. The grain party at the Pa-
villion was supposed to start at
4. It started at 2:30 and the
servers were out of ice by 4.

The Ring-tum Phi called for ‘‘a
little extra planning and care” in
the future, predicting that “With-
out these elements the weekends
will degenerate into nothing.”

Apparently the Dance oard
listened the next year. The Ring-
tum Phi chose to cover more

and in a realistic sense it bk
good that the politicians of ‘76
keep up the tradition and place
it at the highest priority. Every
one knows it’s not the truth, but
we all wish it were. It is equally
relieving to hear our would-be

of the "76 politicians. He ha

him right behind Sen. Jackson
and Gov Wallace's marathon

relevant and important issues dur-
ing the next school year, but
there was one editorial in the
month of February lauding the
Board’s treatment of the tradi-
tional ball as a “crashing success.”
The editorial did not say what
produced the crashing noises, but
it did say, in a prophetic ending
“We do hope it isn’t the last

one.” It almost was.
The New York Times ran a
longer article than the Ring-tum

Phi the next year to announce the

news: no Fancy Dress. The
school paper said there was too
little cash, according to the Dance

no time, due to the ‘reorganization
of the school year.

 

T. S. Eliot once said that “Be-
tween the idea and the reality...
falls the shadow.” The lack of a
January vacation—the traditional
time for Fancy Dress—was a good
idea to use to explain the lack of
a ball. The lack of money was
a harsh reality. But who can deny
that there was a shadow over col-
lege life in general at the time
following the Kent State slaugh-
ter. And who can deny that there
was a shadow on W&L following
the postponement of some classes
and exams the Spring before to
allow students to spend their time
protesting the Indochina war.

That’s the way it was, Septem-
ber 1970. And that’s still the way
it was in January of 1971, when

‘

Palace. Although this year’s whoopee-making is not expected to
match the grandeur of the 1948 Ball pictured above, it should

prove a vast improvement over the rock and roll

as non-candidate

differ-
made on two

io time. NBC reported a
ence in comments
consecutive days.

At Christmas-time, Washington
politicoes were wondering if
Caiter headquarters had the
depth, and a grasp of the broad
Presidental concept, to coordi
nate a nation-wide effort

Now those doubts have turned
to amazement. Ond the key may
be Carter's ability to heed the
advice of a marketing service
once used to improve the ratings
of television stations and pres

entiv hired to improve the rat

ings of a would-be President
Whether these actions will lead

to the nomination is questionable.

The more a candidate becomes
the frontrunner, the more the
pres: will serutinize the coments
cnd eections of that candidate
Carter will have to hold the line
on 4d loble-talking a task he
might not be able to handle.

If ‘72 was the year of the
‘ounce and liberal, surely ‘76
could be the year of the market

ers and public relation firms.

the headline on the only
Dress story of the year
“Fancy Dress Dies Quietly.”

Fancy
read,

The story was different in
February of 1972, when a trium-
phant headline read, ‘Fancy

Dress RETURNS!” There is no way
to theorize on what was on the
minds of W&L students that year:
the intent of the weekend was
too obvious. The first four-hour
grain party was held that year,
followed by a four-hour “Fancy
Dress Concert.” The required ap-
parel was black tie and students
had only one alternative. Their
choice was to dress in t-shirts and
greasy hair; in short, to dress
like the band.

Who was the band? you ask.
Would you believe Sha-na-na?
This was a long way from Glenn
Miller and we are somewhat leery
about calling it a Fancy Dress.
The nostalgia of the 1950's may
p-esent a lot of flash, but there is
very little in it that could be
called faney

The next year the Ring-tum Phi

reported that the only person
wearing a tux at the “Fancy
Dress” concert was the drummer
for Daddy Rabbit. The Rabbit

played one night and Billy Pres
ton the next. Things were not
geting any fancier.

The rest is anticlimatic. Some
one got the fine idea of reshaping
the Danee Board into a Student
Activities Board, perhaps _ be-
cause students acted more than
they danced, and the newly form
ed SAB announced in the Fall
that the theme for the ball would
be “The Land of Oz.”

Somewhere in the interim, the
theme was changed to “Mardi
Gras” and Oz was reiegated to a
tairwell on Main St. and a float
in the Mock Convention parade.
3ut was the Mardi Gras success-
ful? Well, someone dumped a
pitched of beer on the Head of
President Huntley and someone
painted Ol George bright blue.

\nd then last year, everyone
vot drunk and danced.

erals beat the second-place VCAA
team, Hampden-Sydney, before
losing away games to Randolph-
Macon and Allentown College.
The win over Eastern Men

tory against only four losses. It

The W&L wrestling team finish-
d up the regular season with an
mpresive victory over Swearth-
aore College. Unfortunately, they
ost two meets to Temple and
Jelaware University. The loss to
‘emple must be viewed in light
f the fact that Temple has also
eaten Yale, a team which is
anked in the top 20 nationally.
yelaware simply overpowered the
renerals by a seore of 31-6.

The win over Swathmore gives
he Generals a winning season for
he second consecutive year. The
‘in was a total team effort, over
nother team which had a 9-1-1
ecord and was expected to roll
ver the Generals. With the score
6-15 in favor of the Generals,
‘reshman Dan Kniffen scored a
in the 2nd period of the final
1atch of the evening to give the
renerals a 22-15 victory. Kniffen
as done an outstanding job for a
reshman while posting a 15-9
ecord.

But the season is not over for

everybody. VCAA champ Jim
Crytzer has merited an invitation
to the NCAA meet for College
Division I. Crytzer has a 16-6 rec-
ord. He has excellent chance of
placing in the national meet.

Jim Crytzer was the leading
point scorer for the Generals this
year followed by Dan Kniffen and
Kevin McFadden. The Generals
will only lose two members
through graduation, Lee Keck
and Rick Heldrich. Assistant
coach John Spears commented
that “by and large it was a suc-
cessful year even though I thought
we would do better; we started
out with the strongest team we've
had in 3 years but we had a
couple of costly injuries which
hurt us badly. Andy King, who
was a state champ in high school,
was out half of the season with
a nagging head injury is just one
example.”

Because they will only lose two
members of the squad, Coach
Franke expects the team to have
a strong season next year.

was the second time this year
W&L had beaten Eastern Men-
nonite. The first time it took two
overtime periods, however, and
the Generals only won by a point.

W&L won the second Eastern
Mennonite contest by 21 points.
Four Generals finished with
double figures: John Podgajny led
with 18 points followed by Norm
Kristoff (12), Pat Dennis (11) and
Dave Leunig (10).

February 14, the Generals
traveled to Hampden-Sydney.
W&L played two good halfs of
basketball and beat the Tigers,
73-68. Head coach Verne Canfield
was pleased with the effort and
said the team played very well.

Ed Tiernan of H-S led all scor-
ers with 20 points while Podgajny
led the Generals with 18. Jeff
Baum added 14 points followed
by Mike Wenke (11) and Don
Berlin (10).

W&L had a tough time against
Randolph-Macon College February
18 in Ashland, The Generals trail-
ed most of the game and ended
up losing by 25 points, 90-65, at
the buzzer.

Captain Podgajny again led
W&L in scoring with 18 points
followed by Chris Larson (11) and
Wenke (8).

Allentown College edged by
W&L, 60-58, February 20. Can-
field was disappointed in the Gen-
erals’ performance but pointed out
that several players were sick
with a virus. Freshman Dave
Leunig was too sick to play at
all. Chris Larson led W&L in
scoring with 16 points while Krist-
off added 10.

Canfield was satisfied with the
Generals’ season this year. “The
boys have accomplished far more
than people thought,” he said.
The Generals’ coach was disap-
pointed, however,
support from the student body.

The Generals, now 18-6, took on
Maryville College last night. The
season final comes Saturday night
against Madison College in Har-
risonburg.

for fifteen minutes, and already
I had received the summons. Why,
then, may the residents of Jack-
son Ave. park on the wrong side
of the street whenever they wish,
and leave their cars parked for
extended periods?

I am certain that the answer
lies in the fact that these people
are Lexington residents, and not
W&L students, for I have often
seen patrol cars and the Cushman
vehicle on Jackson Ave., and the
police always seem to be looking
in the other direction.

I therefore decry strongly the
attempt of the Lexington City
Police to provide for the city’s
inhabitants the constitutional
principles of “Liberty and equal-
ity for all.” It seems to me that
the good citizens of Lexington
often forget who is (indirectly)
responsible for the very food on
their tables.

Francis J. Merkel, Jr.

Tranquility, gentility
of law school praised

Editor, the Ring-tum Phi:
This is a copy of a letter that
I have sent to Mr. Peyton Neal,
head Law Librarian of your Uni-
versity’s law school. The back-
ground is this: after attempting
to do research on a textbook I
am writing at another institution,
and meeting with a variety of
problems and some treatment that
I did not appreciate, I had the
company for which I am writing
my textbook ask permission for
me to carry on my work at
Washington & Lee. The permis-
sion was granted, I came down,
and was treated beautifully.
Please print the enclosed copy
of my “thank-you note”; I wish
to make my appreciation public,
and I think that your University’s
people should have an occasional
overview of how others see you.
Sincerely,
Christian S. White IV, Esq.
Senior Instructor of Law
The Delaware Law School
of Widener College
Mr. Peyton R. Neal,
Head Librarian

Letters To The Editor...

Washington & Lee University
Law School Library
Dear Mr. Neal:

I am very much in your debt
for the cooperation and courtesy
shown towards me by the Wash-
ington & Lee Law Library in this
past month. I found the staff to
be uniformly polite, helpful, tol-
erant and enthusiastic. I found
the resources available to be com-
pletely sufficient. The people with
whom I dealt were highly com-
petent.

I made use, of course, of the
original law library facilities of
Washington & Lee University.
These facilities, particularly
Tucker Hall, the main building,
were possessed of charming, graci-
ous interiors, architecturally indi-
vidualistic in style; a most at-
tractive compounding of South-
ern Plantation Regency and Beaux
Arts to arrive at a comfortable,
interesting pattern of decor and
space structuring, with a notice-
able lack (to my mind, a highly
desirable lack) of spaces so huge
as to dwarf a person and make
him feel ill-at-ease. In all, Tucker
Hall is an easy building in which
to relax and to concentrate, and is
so without being boring: a very
considerable achievement.

I believe that the ambience of
the building had the effect of re-
inforcing Washington & Lee’s tra-
dition of gentility. The members
of your library  staff—profes-
sionals and students alike—are all
obviously gentlefolk, and their
help, attitudes, and skills all help-
ed to make my period of labor
in your law library a most enjoy-
able and fruitful experience. |
hope that the move to your new
law school will not destroy or
weaken that spirit of gentility;
such a spirit is a precious re-
source, deserving of very effort
to preserve it in an age so con-
spicuous for its uncaringness

rigidity and vulgarity.

I found my visit in your facility
most pleasant, as you may have
gathered, I was made to feel at
home as I have rarely been at
any other institution, and re-
ceived all the help I needed. I
found myself in the midst of a
gentle, humane and lively insti-
tution, as gracious as it was
effective. You have my congratula-
tions on the spirit you have
helped to create among your
people, and my sincere thanks
for permitting me to benefit from
that spirit.

For the future, I hope that the
Washington & Lee law school as
a whole, and its law library in
particular, will remain a_ place
where visiting law professors will
be welcome to come in to do re-
search .. . and where, on cold
nights, a certain bird-dog of the
pointer persuasion named ‘Bev’
will be permitted to come in and
warm up. Such small matters are
a large portion of the humaneness
of any institution, and your
establishment possesses them in
full measure.

Again, my thanks and my con-
gratulations. With every hope that
none of the good things about
your situation will change, I re-
main

Your sincere well-wisher,
Christian §. White IV, Esq.
