The Spinners signed; rock fans protest

By FRITZ GOLDBERG,
Music-editor-at-large and
JOE FITZGERALD,
Assistant News Editor

“We had two people here when
we changed the entire Honor
System,”

Mike Luttig was about ten feet
away from the press section in
the Executive Committee room
when he made that comment.
There were about 150 people in
the room when he said it.

By the time the meeting start-
ed there were an estimated 300
people and one three-legged dog
crowding the small meeting area,
and it was impossible to hear any-
thing said ten feet away.

At issue was the Spinners, a
soul band whose show includes
not only music, but impressions,
mock TV commercials, and a form

of dance that has led their many
imitators over the years to bill
their acts as “Band and Show.”

There are people at W&L who
love this type of performance for
its rhythm, its blues, and its sheer
entertainment value. On the other
hand, there are those who do not.
These two groups, the pros and
the cons on the Spinners, were
the crowd in the E.C, room Tues-
day evening.

On Monday nights, while the
E.C. meets on the first floor of
the Student Center, the Student
Activities Board meets on the top
floor. Usually there are no more
than five observers at the E.C.
meeting, excluding those having
business with group, and there
are even fewer at the SAB meet-
ing.

This week things were different.

While the SAB voted to bring the
Spinners here for Springs week-
end, about ten people, rock fans,
kept a vigil outside their office.
The rock fans were waiting to
voice their opinion if the Spinners
were chosen.

The rock fans got their forum
Tuesday. The SAB voted 7-3 Mon-
day to bring the Spinners. But
there was a catch. The Spinners
are playing at the University of
Virginia on April 24, the night

after they are scheduled to play
here. The back-to-back perform-
ances in the same area are ex-

pected to cut down on the gate
receipts here. So the SAB, after
telling the E.C. on January 12
that they might need an extra
$2000 for Springs weekend, came
back to the E.C. Monday night
to ask for that money.

The allocation was discussed in
a meeting that was described by
E.C. president Leland McCullough
as “closed” and “informal.” The
student body constitution forbids
the allocation of funds under such
circumstances, so the E.C. had to
hold a special meeting Tuesday
‘o appropriate the money.

Clark Thompson, SAB co-chair-
man, began the meeting by ex-
plaining the three options open
to the SAB as of Tuesday night.
They could bring the Spinners
Friday night, April 23, if they
got the cash from the E.C., or
they could bring the Nitty Gritty
Dirt Band on Thursday night, the
22nd, and hire a smaller band to
play the Friday night concert or
they could bring a combination
of small bands and a quantity of
beer Friday night. According to

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Thursday, March 25, 1976

To run amok no more

The Executive Committee has finally taken
some affirmative action in the perennial
what - to - do - about - the - children - in -
the - Student - Center problem. Effective
immediately, the Cockpit is off-limits to all
unaccompanied minors. (The rest of the
building is already off-bounds.)

No one will deny that the situation, where-
in children have been allowed to run amuk in
the Center, has been tolerated for too long.
There are the impromptu soccer games in
the hallways. There is petty thievery and
not-so-petty larceny in the library and the
dining hall. There is damage done in the game
room. There is general disruption and in-
convenience to those for whom the Center
is operated,

On top of this come reports that parents
in the town and surrounding county are up-
set with us for allowing their youngsters to
rummage through the building. We hear that
parents are distraught to learn that their
children attempt to buy beer in the Cockpit
(and sueceed on occasion). We hear that par-
ents are passing a ridiculous rumor that the
building should be renamed the Student Drug
Center, that we are corrupting the minds
of their children and selling them drugs in
the process,

We will refrain from attempting to drive
home any points about parental control,
et cetera. We will attempt to ruminate on the
I2.C.’s decision to ban minors from the Center,
an action which we wholeheartedly support.

For some time now there have been signs
in the Student Center proclaiming all but the
Cockpit to be off-limits to unescorted minors.
These notices have been ignored, although
they threaten trespassers with forcible evic-

Cadets and

There is another problem in the Cockpit
if one cares to call it a problem, It seems
that W&L students are slowly but surely
working up a temper over the extensive
patronage given the tavern by our comrades
the Parade Ground. It seems
that some W&IL. students are upset when
they walk in the Cockpit on Friday or Satur-
day night and find the premises a bit crowded
with the men in gray flannel.

This particular situation has been brought
up in various meetings and in various ad-
ministrators’ offices both here and at V.M.1.
All sorts of ideas are being bandied about,

from across

from hiking prices on beer sold to “outsiders”
to reserving tables exclusively for the use of
W&L students. One can not help but smirk
at the thought of the brawls that could erupt
when parts of the Cockpit were cordoned
off—it might be a return of the type of col-

A matter

Last week's little brouhaha amongst the
members of the law school over the issue
of disenfranchisement of the third-year law
class in E.C, elections deserves comment.

The tiff underscored the point to whieh
relations have decayed between the under-
wrads and the law students, a problem that
is not going to disappear, but which in all
likelihood will inerease in dimension when
the move to Lewis Hall is completed.

The diserepaney between voting regula
tions in the law school and the undergraduate
school was pointed out in last week's regular
IC, meeting. Graduating law students have
heen accustomed to voting for the E.C, repre
sentative for the rising second- and third
vear students; senior undergraduates are not
wiven the option to vote for the following

year's senior representatives. The E.C,
attempted to rectify the diserepaney by “dis
enfranchising” law seniors in the election

Debate quickly mounted among law students
after the meeting, and soon personalities and
all manner of issues irrelevant to the matter
at hand were being raised, The vote was
rescinded in a special meeting Tuesday.

The point we wish to make is one brought

tion and the serving of warrants. This week
action is being taken to start serving war-
rants on repeated offenders, evidently a
small, identifiable group of local children,
According to one represenatative of the E.C.,
that body has been moving “at a snail’s pace”
to begin taking drastic measures to cut down
on the traffic through the Center, but the
warrants may do the trick. It is indeed un-
fortunate to have to enter on these minors’
records notice of these formal complaints, but
repeated verbal warnings have been of little
use,

Since the outside door to the game room
is supposed to be kept locked, local children
have used the Cockpit entrance to that room
to sneak in, Now problems in the game room
should be cut to a minimum, But even more
importantly, the new Cockpit rule should
remove the threat of reprisals by irate parents
against waiters inadvertently serving beer to
minors (if indeed that situation often occurs).

Persons under the age of 18 who are not
students here will still be able to enter the
Student Center when accompanied by an
adult. But unruly children of townspeople
and also of W&L faculty members will no
longer be able to run in and buy a ham-
burger, run relay races in the corridors, or
behave in rowdy fashion in the television
lounges. We applaud the efforts of the E.C.,
even if it has taken them a long time to come
to grips with the problem, and we hope that
local citizens take the new rule in the ap-
propriate light, for in the larger perspective
we are trying to protect their children as
much as we are trying to protect our build-
ing.

the Cockpit

legiate battles that once typified taverns in
two-college towns.

Attempting to control the clientele of a
public restaurant, and that is what the Cock-
pit legally is, smacks of snobbery and elitism.
Showing disruptive minors the way to the
nearest exit is one issue, but restricting use
of the Cockpit just because several students
wander in late in the evening and cannot
find a place to sit down is another. Heaven
knows, the boys in gray have precious few
chances to unwind, Who are we to deny them
a few hours of rest and relaxation, particul-
arly if they arrive and find empty tables?
Somehow it seems this whole issue does not
necd the type of resolution that is being
contemplated. Gentleman, let's not get car-
ried away in this matter.

at.3.

of unity

outin Tuesday's meeting, Members of the law
school are isolated from undergraduates in
a number of ways: social lives revolve in
different spheres and academic concerns are
‘lifferent, to name two, But most importantly,
the functioning of the Executive Committee,
including its administration of the
System, is somehow foreign to most law
students. There appears to be an ever-widen-
ing gulf between Tucker Hall and the rest
of the campus, and with the physical removal
of the law school to its new location across
the ravine, the invisible chasm will widen,

Something needs to be done, and done
soon, to help bridge the gap. If sincere efforts
are not forthcoming, it is not inconceivable
that the members of the may
petition to form their own governing body,
and perhaps even to formulate their own
honor system. We hope matters do not he-
come that strained, We hope that both sides
will realize that this campus needs to stay
united, in rule and in spirit. We hope that
some meaningful action will be taken by the
special University committee studying the
situation,

Honor

Concern for others’ needs;
and devotion to principles

Dean Frank Gilliam was one
of the most popular figures at
Washington and Lee for five
decades. He joined the faculty as
an English teacher in 1926, nine
years after he reeived his B.A.
degree from the University. He
became dean of students in 1931,
and relinquished that post in 1962
to devote his full time to ad-
missions work, which he had also
directed for many years.

In October 1974 the board of
trustees named a freshman dormi-
tory for Dean Gilliam, noting in
a resolution that freshmen “were
customarily the principal bene-
ficiaries of (his) most direct con-
cern, his first obligation.” As dean,
he had established W&L’s ‘“fresh-
man camp” in 1928, an intensive
period of orientation before the
start of classes.

W&L awarded him the honor-
ary Doctor of Laws degree in
1969, with the observation that
‘if indeed it were possible for
the magnitude of his dedication
to and affection for Washington
and Lee to be exceeded, it could
be surpassed only by the love
and admiration of all those to
whom he will always be “the good
dean’.” He also held an honorary
degree from Virginia Episcopal
Seminary.

The student government award
which annually recognizes “the
outstanding contribution to the
University” made by a graduat-
ing student is named for Dean
Gilliam. The award was estab-
lished in 1964.

Also in 1964, the Lynchburg
chapter of the alumni association
presented him with its annual
Citation, the highest honor any
W&L alumni chapter confers, for
“giving emphasis and direction
to the ennobling traditions which
abide in the minds and hearts of
Washington and Lee men, where-
ever they be.”

Why a finance pledge?

Editor, the Ring-tum Phi:

In last Monday's election, my
name was not listed on the ballot.
1 handed in my petiiton; and
while I conducted my campaign
in good faith, not violating any
regulations, I was not listed on
the ballot because I was not
informed that a pledged state-
ment of finances was required,
As soon as I was told of this
requirement, I complied by pledg-
ing that I did not spend over the
limit.

I firmly believe this is a com
munity of honor, where a man’s
word is more valuable than legal-
istic formulae; however, my word
of honor was somehow made
worthless because it was given at
10:00 p.m. election eve rather
than at 7:00 pm. It remains a
mystery how the passage of time
can affect the quality of an honor
pledge.

I would like to thank those who
wrote in my name for E.C. senior
representative, and hope | will
have an opportunity to serve the
University and Honor System in
the future.

Concert controversy

Editor, the Ring-tum Phi:

Thank God I'm leaving in June
I cannot believe that anyone in
his right mind would pay $16,000
to present a concert by the Spin-

President Huntley said on Dean
Gilliam’s death: ‘This University
has had more than its share of
special persons in its history—
but it may be that even W&L has
never had another like Frank
Gilliam.”

Huntley said Gilliam was char-
tcterized by “complete integrity,
daily concern with the needs of
others, and strong-minded devo-
tion to high principles.”

Dean Gilliam was widely recog-
nized in the academic world for
his work as admissions director
and dean of students. Under his
influence, Washington and Lee
became the first men’s college in
the south to require applicants to
take the College Board tests, and
in 1952 he became the first repre-
sentative of any southern school
to be named to the College En-
trance Examination Board execu-
tive committee.

After his graduation from W&L
in 1917, Gilliam served as a first
lieutenant in the 119th infantry
as part of the Allied Expedition-
ary Force, and saw further service
during World War II as an Army
major. From 1920 to 1926 he was
director of education for the
American Presbyterian Congo
Mission. He learned the Buluba
dialect of Bantu in his first three
weeks in Africa, and spent the
succeeding years teaching and
translating textbooks.

He was born in Lynchburg April
22, 1895, the son of the late
James R. and Jessie Johnson
Gilliam. He was married in 1924
to the former Louise Fontaine
Johnson, who died May 27, 1973.
Dean Gilliam is survived by a
brother, James R. Gilliam Jr. of
Lexington, by two children.
Fontaine J. Gilliam of Gaffney,
S.C., and Mrs. Robert L. (Louise
Augusta Gilliam) Hopkins of
Ashland, Va., and by three grand-
children.

In 1963, Dean Gilliam recalled
how he had begun his Lalf-century
association with Washington and
Lee. He and Mrs, Gilliam had
been ordered by her physician to
leave the Congo, and accordingly
he was looking for a job in educa-
tion—“but not in any great hurry
to make a decision. One night in
November the telephone rang. It
was Dr. (Edgar F.) Shannon of
the English department. ...He
asked if I could come up and
teach freshman English for him.
... 1 caught the five o’clock train
out of Lynchburg...and taught
my first class at nine. Since then
I have had my foot in the crack
of the door, and the University
hasn’t been able to shut it.” Six
years ago in a letter to a new
W&L employee he wrote: “In 1926
I came here for a three-weeks
assignment. I’ve been here for 44
years.”

Even after his formal retire-
ment from administrative duties
in 1963, when he was elected
dean emeritus by the board of
trustees, he remained an active
advisor to W&L’s presidents, and
he had an office in Washington
Hall until his death. He knew
virtually every student by name
and remembered them immedi-
ately whenever they would return
to the campus years later—‘as
you would have guessed,” Presi-
dent Huntley recently remarked.
“It is a black and almost non-
existent day when he can't re-
member a student’s name, no
matter how seldom he sees him,”
a student vrote in 1949.

Dean Gilliam’s confidence in
W&L never wavered. In a 1971
interview he observed: “We are
so far superior to what we have
ever been before, so much

stronger in our ability to meet
our primary goals, our educa-
tional objectives, that I cannot
help but be immensely pleased
with the developments I’ve seen.’

their state is going to go in the
primary, if said primary is one
of those coming in the weeks
after the convention.

But that’s only half the job. In
the event that no one comes to
the floor with enough committed
delegates to walk away with a
first-ballot nomination, the states
have to find someone out there
who can tell them where their
votes should go on the succeed-

And before the selection pro-
cess goes too far, the delegates
will probably find themselves
faced with such cosmic questions
as whether Mo Udall can fall

whether Scoop Jackson can fall

Carter can fall behind anybody,
or whether George Wallace can

It sounds complicated. It sounds
tough. It sounds impossible.

Tar Heels stick Generals m1

By BILL FLESHER

Larry Turkheimer turned in
the three-goal “hat trick” while
North Carolina’s defense held
Washington and Lee’s high-scor-
ing offense in check to give the
Tar Heels a 9-6 win Saturday at
Wilson Field.

A crowd of nearly 3000 looked
on as UNC raised its record to 2-1,
while the Generals suffered their
first loss in four starts.

North Carolina coach Paul Doty
called the win “one we had to
have, especially after the Mary-
land game (the Terrapins won,
12-10 in overtime) because every-
one was watching to see if we
are for real.”

The Tar Heels proved they will
be a team to be reckoned with
this season, as they controlled the
ball and the Generals for the bet-
ter part of the contest.

North Carolina faceoff mid-
fielders Dave Yingling and Randy
Gilbert won 12 of 18 faceoffs be-
tween them. As a result, the Heels
were able to keep the pressure on
W&L goalie Charlie Brown
throughout the game.

The Generals’ sophomore net-
minder kept W&L in the game
with 20 saves, 13 of them coming
in the first half.

“Brown and (Tom) Keigler were
the best players on the field, and
that includes my team,” Doty said.
“Those two stopped us from
getting a big lead when we
thought we had a chance to go
way out in front.”

Doty also had praise for All-
American defenseman Rob Lind-
sey, who shut out UNC’s high-
scoring attackman Tom Venier.

“Lindsey did a number on him,
that’s for sure,” Doty said. Venier
paced North Carolina in the
Maryland game with four goals
and three assists.

But the UNC defense didn’t do
badly, either, even though they

played without starter John
Threshie, who injured a_ knee
against Maryland.

The Tar Heel defense held

W&L’s attack to three goals, and
stopped the Generals cold for al-

most 19 minutes between the first
and third quarters.

W&L had taken a 1-0 lead when
Rob Morgan beat UNC goalie
Chuck Weinstein in a one-on-one
situation at the 2:54 mark.

North Carolina took its first
lead nine minutes later on goals
by Turkheimer and Dan Buren.
But W&L bounced right back as
freshman Chris Kearney and
Charlie Stieff scored to give the
Generals a 3-2 lead at the quarter.

Stieff’s goal was the last thing
Generals’ fans had to cheer about
until after intermission. The Tar
Heels scored three goals within
two minutes midway through the
second quarter to take the lead
for good.

Midfielder Marty Sutton scored
the first of his two goals with
W&L a man down to tie the game
3-3. Then middies Steve Sartorio
and Paul Worstell beat Brown on
hard outside shots to put UNC
in front, 5-3.

After W&L’s Donny Carroll and
UNC’s Dan Cox traded goals early
in the third quarter, Turkheimer
got a goal that may have been the
beginning of W&L’s end.

As North Carolina defenseman
Dave Klarman started upfield on
a fast break, Brown left the case
to cover Turkheimer, who was
wide open about 20 yards in front
of the goal.

Klarman fired a pass at Turk-
heimer, who reached just high
enough to deflect the ball and
send it toward the open net pas
Brown, who must now know how
Johns Hopkins’ Kevin Mahon felt
when Brown scored in last year’s
NCAA playoff from 75 yards out.

W&L again fought back to
within one goal at 7-6. Chris Lar-
son scored on an outside shot late
in the third period, while Jack
Dudley got an extra-man goal at
6:23 of the fourth quarter.

But Yingling won the all-im-
portant faceoff after Dudley's
goal, and W&L never got the ball
for a chance at a tying goal.

Turkheimer took a Randy Gil-
bert feed in front of the cage and
beat Brown for his third goal with
4:24 left to give UNC a 86 lead.

Six swimmers gain
All-American status

A two-time national champion,
six All-Americans and an eighth
place national ranking.

That’s the record compiled by
the swimming team last weekend
during the NCAA national swim-
ming championships (Division II)
in Washington, Pa.

John Hudson became W&L’s
first national champion as he won
two events, the 500-yard and 1,-
650-yard freestyles. He also fin-
ished third in the 20-yard free-
style and anchored W&L’s 800-
yard freestyle relay team that
placed seventh.

The list of All-Americans also
includes diver Bill Cogar and free
styler Tad Van Leer, Keith Ro-
mich, Rod Seott and Chip Hoke.

Cogar made All-American with
a sixth-place finish in the one-
meter diving: Van Leer was an
All-Ameriacn in the 50-yard free-
stvle after finishing 10th, and Ro-
mich made it after a ninth-place
finish in the 200-yard freestyle.

Scott, the team captain, and
Hoke joined Hudson and Romich
on the 800-yard freestyle relay

top 12 in national competition a-
chieve All-American status.

The eighth-place finish for
Coach Bill Stearns’ team was the
highest ever in the history of
W&L, which perennially has a top-
rated team. Since W&L inaugur-
ated its swimming program in the
1920’s, the Generals have record-
ed 36 winning seasons, including
eight when they went undefeated.
Since World War Il, W&L has had
26 winning years, two break-even
seasons and just one losing year.

St. Lawrence University won the
nation Division HI team cham-
pionship with 249 points, followed
in order by Johns Hopkins (233),
Williams (170), Bowdoin (143),
Kenyon (140), Wabash (126), Al-
legheny (78), W&L (74) and Ash-
land (61).

Two minutes later, W&L lost the
ball during a clear, and Sutton
scored into an open net to wrap
up the win for North Carolina.
The Generals were plagued by
poor shooting throughout the
game. W&L was outshot 47-35 by
the Tar Heels, and on four of tack
eight man-up situations, the Gen-
crals failed to get off a shot.
The Generals face another
tough early-season opponent
Saturday in the Naval Academy.
Navy beat W&L, 14-8, in Lex-

Baseball squad still undefeated

By GARY COLLIER

Although many of the players
are the same, this year’s baseball
team is showing little resemblence
to last year’s squad Washington
and Lee’s baseball team, continu-
ing their winning ways, extended
their record to 3-0 with a 4-3 extra-
inning victory over Providence
last Thursday.

In the bottom of the 12th, Mich-
ael Clary, scoring from second
base, slid safely under the catch-
er’s tag at home with the winning
run following Maynard McCorkle’s
single to center. Clary reached
first on a wide throw to the first-
baseman from the shortstop. The
shortstop, fielding Clary’s ground-
er to his right, had to hurry his
throw in an effort to beat Clary
to first. Clary took second when
the catcher bobbled a low throw
from the Providence pitcher. After
Clary advanced to second, Provi-
dence walked Co-captain Dave
Otey, which brought McCorkle to
the plate.

Dan Westbrook went the full 12

innings for the Generals, allowing
only three hits while striking out
seven batters. The win was West-
brook’s second three-hitter of the
young season.

Going into the bottom of the
eighth inning, the game was tied
2.2, Mike Falcone then put W&L
on top 3-2 with a 355-foot homer.

The Friars came back to tie up
the game in the top of the ninth.
Following a single up the middle
and a steal, another single to cen-
ter scored the runner from sec-
ond. According to many of the
spectators, the game should have
ended in the ninth. What appear-
ed to most to be the game-winning
strike-out pitch was called a ball
by the umpire. The batter, given
the alleged second chance, then
hit the game-tying single.

In the 10th, W&L had a base-
runner but could not score.

In the 11th, the Generals once
again threatened, but what could
have been the game winning run
was thrown out at home plate.

Students air discontent with SAB plans

(Continued from page 1)
rock people have had no con-
certs or dances to satisfy them.
A poll taken earlier this year by
the SAB was answered by 32%
of the student body and showed
that a majority of those students

preferred rock music to soul.
Another argument of the rock

fans was that the Spinners would
be in Charlottesville, an hour-and-
a-half drive from Lexington, the
night after they are scheduled
to appear here.

SAB members answered that.
granted, there have been many

soul bands here this year, but only
two of them were sponsored by

  

 

Ask Traveller

the SAB. The SAB tried to find
a good rock band for the week-
end in question, but found that
most of the performers they in-
vestigated were either too ex:
pensive or already booked for the
weekend. The mention of the
Charlottesville appearance of the
Spinners was answered with the
statement that the SAB hopes to
make Springs a big event at W&L.
and not at U.Va. (An issue not
brought out at the meeting Tues-
day concerning the U.Va. con-
cert is the fact that students who
attended that performance would
be making the drive after a four-
hour grain party.)

 

Q—Hlow do you explain all the Phi Beta Kappa’s given this year when
SATs are getting progressively lower and the average student
can't even sing the Campbell’s Soup jingle without harassing a

housewife first?

A—Good question. What seems to be a paradoxical situation, (moral
and mental deficiency being abundantly rewarded), is really just
a Canadian stand-off, which is not a smelly lumberjack, but rather
a type of problem having any number of equally ridiculous

answers.

The most obvious answer for low scores/high grades is the
sliding scale, by which a test score may be altered to compensate
for the test-taker’s background, intelligence, shoe size, or lack
of hair. As you may know, half the inhabitants of ancient Pompei
were posthumously awarded 720’s on their Law Boards through
the modern miracle of the sliding scale. (The other half were
disqualified for flicking ash all over the floor of the test center.)

Of course, the sliding scale can work both ways. Lower SAT’s
do not necessarily mean that W&L is getting an inordinate num-
ber of Western State out-patients as new students. It may signify
that standardized tests are becoming more difficult to take and
to accurately grade, or that they are being given to more diverse
groups, or that some Education Testing Center idiot in New
Jersey hasn’t gotten paid and is having some fun until he does.

Another possible reason for the spate of Gold Key winners is
the shocking amount of out-and-out booking going on at W&L.

Hard work, steady application, and a canacity

for sweating

through your hair can certainly make up for a lack of native
intelligence. And that, of course, cannot be measured by stand-
ardized tests. The one thousand volumes supposedly taken each
year from McCormick Library are not being taken by dishonest
students or stealthy cadets. Those books are literally demolished
through the constant handling and scuffling by Phi Beta Kappa
hopefuls. If you don’t believe me, just take a look at that human
anatomy book behind the loose brick on the fifth level. Either
the preface is shredded or that’s a mighty strange-looking pelvis.

Q—-Isn’t it possible that professors are just grading easier?

A—It’s a pleasant thought. But the real issue is who ripped off the
section on “The Female Figure in Motion” from behind that
loose brick. The next shipment of anatomy texts won’t come in

for another month.

To the Editor

(Continued from page 2)

as a preferred concert. Have they
no consideration for the opinion
of the student body? Those of
us who enjoy rock have been
denied enough this year. Since
September, we have been inun-
dated with Soul music. How about
you guys on the SAB thinking
about the majority and not about
yourselves.

Let me also add that the
Souther, Hillman, Furay concert
of a year ago should not be the
basis for deciding against rock
concerts. It was as poorly planned
a concert as one could be. Only
750 people showed up. Why? I’m
sure it had something to do with
the fact that it was held mid-
term week. If it was set for a
weekend and had it been prop-
erly advertised, many more stu-
dents would have attended.

Somewhere along the line,
there is a communicaiton gap be-
tween the student leaders and
the majority of the student body
Those who hold office at W&L
better show more responsibility.
Don't forget about the little
people who elected you!

Lack of delegates, upcoming primaries face MC 76

(Continued from Page 2)
only came a few votes away
from giving it to McGovern in ’72.

Hal Wellford, credentials chair-
man, was not so optomistic on
Monday night, saying then that
he would like to wait and see the
shape of the coming primaries be
fore making any guesses. Also, he
seems inclined to wait and see
what happens over the break.

State chairmen are being en-
couraged to do some of their
phone work then, and Wellford
speculated that if the work is not
done then, the MC may be ina
trouble, The crunch is apparently
coming in the rank-and-file, mail-
and-file, phone-and-file underbelly
of the research process.

There are good arguments right
now for just about any outlook
one cares to have on the chances
of success for the MC. On the
brighter side, 1,317 of the dele-
gates to the real thing will have
been picked by the time the deal
comes down. One of the states
that will be chosen (on April 6)
is New York, a state that set an
excellent example by their before
the-fact contact with the situa-
tion in ’'72. The mock delegation
did such a good job on the floor

the last time that Morgan is re-
ferring to the “New York model”
of research and prediction in dis-
cussing the way things should be
done this year.

For those who care to take a
pessimistic view towards the odds
on MC success, one of the main
arguments might be that 961 dele-
gates worth of primaries will take
place after the MC. These include
the Nebraska-Oregon-California
group, a major test of Western
suport and a major test of any
candidate’s ability to gain and
keep momentum. Also coming up
after the MC are Ohio and Cali-
fornia, both of which have over
a hundred delegates to choose and
a favorite son candidate to steal
some of those votes from the
genuine contenders,

The number one issue for the
pessimists right now may be the
general lack of a surge of en
thusiasm on campus toward the
MC. A recent sign-up night in
the shadow of a “1776” rehearsal
brought in several persons, but
some of the delegates still are not
filled. Chairmen may find them
selves faced in late April not only

with the job of finding out what
will happen in the real world, bui
also with the job of recruiting
warm bodies here in Lexington.

The best way to bet on the
accuracy of the MC may be to
use the formula that Morgan cited
recently. According to him, bas-
ing his estimate on the past 68
years, with 10 out of 14 correct
choices, the MC chances would be
66. Basing his estimate on the
past 20 years, 4 out of 5 correct
choices, and close to McGovern in
‘72, he came up with the 85%
figure mentioned earlier.
