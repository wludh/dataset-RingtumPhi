Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Making mountains
out of molehills

Matters came to a head once again this week over what
role black students are to play in the University. The Student
Association for Black Unity came before the Executive Com-
mittee to complain that its recommendations to the Student
Activities Board had not been given due consideration.

After patiently listening to arguments, rebuttals, refuta-
tions, counter-arguments and the like for nearly three hours,
the EC ended the discussion by simply telling SABU that it
should appear before the Committee in future years to request
funds for activities it cares to sponsor, rather than attempting
to finance such projects through the Activities Board.

That the Executive Committee passed no resolutions and

in short did virtually nothing (except promote a clearing of,

the air) is significant. We feel that there is little the EC wisely
should do to insure that events endorsed by SABU be
given preferéntial treatment by the Activities Board. Like any
other group, SABU should be able to present its proposals to
the Board, and to push for their adoption, but sanctions man-
dated by the EC should be avoided, Having to accede to the
requests of SABU by law, the SAB would be hamstrung even
more, since it already has little choice about its main events:
Homecoming, Fancy Dress and Springs.

For the Executive Committee to impose definite rules on
the SAB and its choice of cultural events proposed by SABU
would be tantamount to admitting that overt discrimination
does exist and is sanctioned through the process of choosing
entertainment, scheduling, and so forth.

That is the crux of the matter. Although the sentiment was
never expressed in such a blunt manner, what really concerns
the members of SABU is that it believes its proposal was
killed because of prejudices held by SAB members, rather
than other considerations such as cost of the event and
scheduling difficulties. But we fail to see where the cause of
racial equality is being served by the tactics used by SABU to
inake known its displeasure.

The members of SABU took the right action by airing
their grievances before the EC. We believe, however, that
the members of SABU erred in magnifying the issue to a
distorted size and jumping to conclusions about the SAB’s
reasons for not scheduling a concert during the coming Black
Culture Program.

The SAB made a mistake by not promptly informing
SABU of its intention not to schedule a concert in January.
We also feel that, although they were perhaps negligent in
disclosing their plans specifically before SABU officers, they
were nevertheless justified in their choice of alternative en-
tertainment to a concert. In other words, from the arguments
presented before the EC, it cannot be inferred that racial
prejudice motivated the Activities Board in its actions.

Most thoughtful students recognize the plight of the black
student on this campus. More than any other group he has
unique problems in coping with life in Lexington, But this
in itself does not justify the giving of preference, dispropor-
tionate to the influence SA\BU has on campus, in matters of
entertainment, Other groups, notably the independent. stu-
dents, are currently given less deference,

The solution to future conflicts of this nature is to request
of SABU that it henceforth come before the EC to ask for
funding for events it feels are worthy of consideration, events
which benefit a wide range of students. By coming before
the EC in September during the budget hearings, SABU will
be on a par with the other standing committees, service groups
and special interest organizations. The EC's budget hearings
are a matter of public record, and therefore no misunderstand-
ings, at least of the kind typified by this current situation,
should arise. All actions taken on SABU's proposals will be
taken with its full knowledge, and it will not have cause to
suspect any surreptitious maneuvering in the decisions
reached,

begins to ponder whether one is
wasting time there or not, Wasted

time, however, is about the last thing
that could be said about the current
production of “The Birds,” a Greek
comedy by Aristophanes.

Written in 414 B.C. “The Birds”
was chosen as a senior thesis pre-
sentation by R. Lecky Stone. Mr.
Stone chose to slightly modernize the
classic Greek comedy in his basic
character interpretations, as stated in
the program notes. At any rate, en-
joyment can be derived from wateh-

University
programs prospering this year

By TOM RENTSCHLER

Few and far between are the
genuine opportunitics to help one’s
fellow man, but this year, as in the
past, the University Federation of
Volunteers is sponsoring a variety of
programs aimed at doing just that.
Much of the impetus for the Fed-
eration comes from senior Jim Haines,
who is president of the organization,
and Mike Capetto, who is acting as
the advisor.

Under the direction of these two,
the Federation has organized various
programs falling under the category
of community services. With the
Wwhole-hearted support of the Uni-
versity the programs have grown an-
nually in involvement, In faet, the
number of applications received by
the Federation in one week exceeded
the number received last year in an
entire semester,

 

Ask Traveller

the characters to modern man’s situa-
tion,

Brad Liston as Euelpides and Dan
Scott as Pisthetairos are two weary
travellers who go off in search of
the King of the Birds, Epops the
Hoopoe (as portrayed by Alex Bour-
drez). They find him in his mountain
hideaway and try to persuade him to
establish a new land situated between
heaven and earth,

Pisthetairos puts the
a new land before the birds in the
form of a referendum, After some
comical persuasion the vote in favor
of the new land, Cukookooland, is
ascertained. Pisthetairos emerges as
the King, naturally, but first he must
reckon with the gods, After insulting
Iris (Margot Marcucei) he ends up

question of

marrying Miss Universe (also Miss
Marcucci) and flies away to happi-
ness, leaving the birds to administer
the kingdom,

My, Scott’s interpretation of Pisthe-
tairos is a fair one; the energy and
confidence he displays while on stage
are pure Scott and not unlike any of
his previous roles at W&L, (Thank
god he wears a mask this time so
we are not subjected to that obnoxi-
ous sinile.) The sore throat) with
which Mr, Scott is apparently suffer-
ing detracted somewhat from his per-
formance,

Mr. Liston (Eucipices) — is
magnetic. His every movement or
gesture reflected his fantastic — in-
terpretation of character. A fresh-
man here, Mr. Liston did quite a
bit of acting and directing in- his

The community services program
consists of three projects all of which
are stalled with dedicated students
wishing to devote their free time to
those less fortunate than themselves.
The result is a very rewarding ex-
perience for those involved and for
those who receive help,

Perhaps the most rewarding project
from the standpoint of the volunteers

is the Big Brother program at the

Q. Many people have been speculating as to what all this digging up of the

have ventured such proposals as subways and

A. This, obviously, has been Lexington's closely and only guarded sceret.

‘This effort

involved torturing emigre squirrels from the Woods Creck project late
nights in Dean Atwood’s office, and thanks to them and other sources

we now have this to report:

\ wealthy alumnus, it scems, recently graduated from W&L (name

withheld),

has donated a considerable

sum of money to the “City” of

Lexington (including back parking fines) for the purpose of replacing
the streets of Lexington with, you guessed it, a system of canals, Enough
money has been provided so that the Maury and James Rivers ean be
rerouted in order to supply the water necessary,

Now you might wonder why all this is being done, It seems that

our

unknown alumnus had taken a course in

Venetian history, and

actually developed a burning passion to see and experience that famous

city,

After graduation he immediately left on a grand tour of Europe,

Naturally no Grand Tour would be complete without a visit to Venice,
and he did that, While there he learned of Venice's evil plight, in that

a need for more children who need
help. The service of the student
volunteers has been overwhelmnig,

Another of the projects has been
the tutorial program organized with
the clementary schools in the city of
Lexington. A total of 90 students
volunteers devote time helping ele-
mentary students learn the — basic
reading, writing and — arithmetic
skills that they must learn. The
volunteers work closely with the
principals and teachers at the vari-
ous schools and they provide the
individual attention which many
youngsters need, but which teachers
are unable to fully provide. The
results have been tremendous. Many
children have received the necessary
tutoring to enable them to pass the
course which they would otherwise
have failed.

The most difficult of projects is
the volunteer work which goes on
at the Western State Mental Hospital
in Staunton, The 25 student volun-
teers involved in this program work
in the alcoholic ward at the hospital
and also receive in-service training
from the staff members, Many volun-
teers receive instruction in the rudi-
mentary forms of therapy; staff mem-
bers have been very pleased with the
results,

Most importantly, the volunteers
demonstrate to the patients that
they do indeed care about them. ‘This
is often the therapy that many of
the patients need and the volunteers
have been more than willing to pro-
vide it,

All of the projects are worthwhile
from any standpoint, and, accord.
ing to Capetto, the real importance
of the program is that the volunteers
are “giving a part of themselves” to
someone who is in great need of it.
\nd they receive nothing for their
service but the great satisfaction of
knowing that they have served.

posed as to write things as

high os years. From his perform-
once “The Birds,” we should ex-
pect to see some very impressive per-
formances from him in the future,
Speaking of Mr. Liston’s gestures,
some of the local dowagers have been
heard to comment that they would
not have minded seeing Mr. Liston
in last year’s “Changing Room” pro-
duction,

John Ellis (Koryphairos) deserved
every ovation he received. Mr. Ellis
played his part with such exuber-
ance and intensity that everyone
seemed to be mesmerized by his per-
formance,

Alex Bourdvez (Epops the Hoopoe)
played his character with energy, but
not really with enough. Possibly not
Bourdrez’ fault, his stage presence
and some of his lines were either
stepped on by our two travellers or
lost in the cacaphony of the chorus.

The chorus, with captain Don
Hogle, a 1975 graduate of W&L, did
a passable job of interpreting the
chorus of a Greek comedy, The main
problem was that the University
Theatre does not have the acousties
of an amphitheatre, It is a shame
that we lost what we did because
of a few hoots or caws. The choreo-
graphy of the chorus (by Hogle) was
as we should expect it to be with
Mr. Hogle’s direction, rather good,
A problem here is that it is hard
to make a Nureyev of a football
player.

The double and sometimes triple
parts were handled extremely well
by all, even though we could notice
when the actor was really enjoying
himself, as shown by Chris Willet
(Kenesias) and Brian Garr (Tri-
ballos).

Miss Mareucci (Iris and Miss Uni-
verse) did a very entertaining job as
she floated down from heaven, The
Theatre really gets the damnedesi
people to fly in that swing. One does
wonder how they are going to work
that swing into “Endgame,” “The

Visit’ and “1776!”

really do not understand Mr,
Romanchuk’s use of an effect’ like
the swing so soon after using it
prominently last’ spring. IT wonder
because Mr. Romanchuk certainly

outdid himself in other respects this
time. ‘The set, for example, superbly
represents the top of a mountain in
Greece.

Costumes and masks are very
effective, the color and form adding
a striking visual aspect to offset the
bleak mountain top,

Aristophanes’ play is in sum a
production that is marvelously en-
tertaining for any scholar or non-
scholar. Congratulations to Mr. Stone,

Failing to score on numerous oc-
casions, the Generals of W&L lost to
a quick and talented VMI soccer club
2-0 dropping their season record to
1-7.

The game was similar to last year’s
W&L-VMI contest which ended in a
1-1 deadlock. This year however,
VMI wound up on top. The
Lexington arch-rivals fought a close,
seesaw contest until a VMI lineman
cracked the nets for the score with
21:17 elapsed in the second half,
The Generals displayed good ball
control most of the game but couldn't
quite put it all together when they
reached the VMI goal, VME spoiled
the Generals’ hopes for a come-from-
behind vietory 20 minutes later as a
\MI lineman drilled a long, hard
shot in the Generals’ goal with 3:54
remaining in the game. The Gen-
ervals last-minute efforts failed and
the Keydets won 2-0. The sad part
about the game is that W&L should

Generals seck

ers Keith Lewis and Ben Newell mak
ing unlikely catches, Hampden-
Sydney increased their lead to 10-0
on a time consuming I1-play drive
which climaxed on a 3 yard Newell-
to-Lewis touchdown pass. Minutes
later the ‘Vigers marched downfield
again with another threat but a last
second Newell-to-Snodgrass potential
touchdown pass failed when Snod-
grass, Hampden-Sydney's burly tight
end who seemingly played the game
with Mazola rubbed on his hands,
dropped the ball after sneaking be-

hind the Generals’ secondary,

W&L's misfortunes continued into
the opening minutes of the second
half. ‘The defensive tackle
Gary Coleman scooped up a W&L
fumble on the Generals’ 24 yard line
again giving the Cats good position.
From there the ‘Tigers inserted thei
back-up quarterback Don Sequin,
who hit on two passes, the second
good for twenty and seven
points as the pesky Ben Newell broke
free of the W&L secondary and haul-
ed ina perfect pass to up the ‘Tiger's
lead to 17-0.

Support for rugby team needed

By KEN MASTRILLI

In recent years, rugby at W&L has
for some reason earned a very
ignominious reputation as a sporting
outlet for all those that are eithe
mentally deficient or of a sadistic
persuasion, Upon inquiring about
this peculiar atitude, many com
ments that I've received have only
enforced these assumptions. Expres-
sions like “you gotta be nuts,” oF
“I like my body just the way it is,
in one piece,” and others of a simi-
liar nature dominate the main types
of reply. Undergruates have the no-
tion that only law students partici-
pate, None of these assumptions have
any foundation whatsoever.

It is necessary that the game be
put in the proper perspective, Rugby
really is not any more dangerous
than daily life in the freshmen domi-
tovies, as almost any upperclassmen
could tell you of many harrowing
experiences that he has encountered,
Serious injuries are
existem due to the very mature of
the game, There is no blocking al-
lowed, which cuts down on the num-
ber of knee injuries, and since the
ball is in constant movement there

almost non

is lithe chance of high speed col-
lision between players.

True, law students comprise a ma

jority of the players but there are
also close to ten undergraduates that
play regularly, This year there will
be a number of openings due to
graduation and it that
we arouse an interest in the under-

is essential

graduate ranks to keep the program
going.

One learn the rules in a
very short time; we don't practice
more than one time a_ week,

can

and

you don't have to have any ex-
perience in order to tryout, Almost
everyone gets to play, as we
two teams, an A side and a B side.

Both teams get to play each week,

and if you show up you get to play—
it's that simple,

Now for the good part. After each
there is a small party for
concerned; players, dates,

Thompson also said that the Na-

the same week as the SABU culture

some variety in campus entertain-

Thompson cited the fact that there

Perry said that the issue is not

qrback Jack Berry was faced) with
the unenviable task of preventing the
sub-capacity crowd of less than 2000
from heading toward the exit gates
Berry accomplished this difficult feat
OY generating some excitement into
the somewhat lackluster contest by
heaving two long touchdown passes
of 79 and 73 yards to wide receivers
Rich Wiles and Tony Perry to nar-
row the gap to 17-13 early in’ the
fourth quarter.

Not to be outdone, Tiger quarter-

Berry, desperately attempting to even
the score, threw a costly interception
to H-S'’s Mike Paxton. Ferguson's
third field goal of the game followed
to all but end the game.

Berry, refusing to concede defeat,
went to the air again on the Gen-
erals’ next possession, only to have
another pass picked off, this time
by defensive back Baril, Baril re-
turned the ball to the W&L 21 yard
line where Berry took out his frus-
trations by committing a “face mask-
ing” violation which moved the ball
down to the 10 yard line. Half back
Drew Davis ran it in two plays later
to make the score 29-13 which was
how it ended,

E.C, member Dave Davis suggested
that SABU might be aided with
money from the E.C, Funding budget,
but the idea was not discussed by
the committee.

The meeting finally ended with a
