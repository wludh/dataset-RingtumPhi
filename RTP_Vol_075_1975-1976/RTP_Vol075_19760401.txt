By BOB CHIAVIELLO

The Executive Committee re-
signed itself Monday night to the
fact that it may never hear the
end of the controversy over the
Spinners concert to which it
gave $2000 last week.

Senior Michael Stritch present-
ed a petition with 320 signatures
at Monday night’s Executive Com-
mittee meeting. The petition ask-
ed for a full disclosure on how
much of the student tax would be
used for the Spinners concert
later this month, and further re-
quested that after the amount
spent on the concert by each stu-
dent was determined, the money
should be refunded to the signers
of the petition. The petition
pledged that all who signed it
would forego attendance at the
concert.

The petition claimed that stu-

dents’ musical interests had been
denied by the SAB and that the
E.C. had refused to represent their
constituents in this matter. Bobby
Pugh, Senior E.C. representative,
claimed that as far as he was
concerned he did represent the
people who elected him.

Mynders Glover, who _ voted
against the SAB’s Spinner request,
pointed out that the SAB can-
not please everyone. “Some ac-
tivities dissatisfy and some don’t,”
he said. He went on to state
that once the E.C. makes a de-
cision the student should “abide
by that decision.”

Sandy Stradtman explained that
the petition was “just a word
game,” and that the money will
come out of the student body
reserve fund, “if there isn’t
enough support for the concert.”

George C. Scott visits campus;
films scenes for Lee documentary

By ROBERT KEEFE
Cub Reporter

A feature on Robert E. Lee’s
post-Civil War years as president
of Washington College, now Wash-
ington and Lee University, will
be broadcast next Friday, April 9,
as part of the NBC-TV Today
show's Bicentennial “salute to
Virginia.”

The Lee segment was written
and narrated by George C. Scott,

the Academy Award-winning
actor, who is also a Lee authority.
Most of the filming took place
Sunday and Monday on the W&L
campus, with brief additional
scenes shot on Main Street in Lex-
ington and at the original grave
of Stonewall Jackson in the Jack-
son Cemetery.

Host for the Today show’s two-

Among the scenes filmed at

Other footage of Scott was shot
on the historic Front Campus, with
the Colonnade in the background,

and in Lee Chapel, where both
Lee's office and the famed Re-

concert.” Stritch was quick to
point out that the petition was
not an organized boycott, but just
a Statement of the students’ views.

The E.C. voted unanimously to
table the request for a refund of
the concert money.

In further business the E.C.
heard a request by Bill Kerr,
chairman of the Voting Regula-
tions Board, on changes in the
voting procedure for student body
elections.

Kerr enumerated a number of
voting irregularities and ways to
correct them. Kerr claimed that
the largest infraction concerned

 

the use of the list of names of
those who have already voted. He
suggested that a candidate can-
not look at the list for more than
five minutes, and that he must
move at least ten feet from the
polling place.

It was recommended that the
now-mandatory statment of fi-
nances be dropped, and that it
be replaced by the candidates
pledge that he will follow all
regulations. This pledge must be
given by 7 p.m. on Monday before
the election.

Revolutionary War scenes, pri-
marily involving Washington. The
series was commissioned by the
United States government in 1932
to commemorate the 200th an
niversary of Washington's birth

REVIEW andOUTLOOK A dams ,

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
Thursday, April 1, 1976

And now a petition

Suddenly the Executive Committee room is the chic spot
in which to be seen. Two weeks ago there were fifty aspiring
statesmen at the gathering. The next afternoon three dozen
law students showed up for a special session, Last Tuesday
more than three hundred students were present to hear debate,
and to interject their own lucid or obtuse comments, on the
spring concert. And last night two dozen fellows appeared
in support of a petition,

The petition of Mr. T. Michael Stritch et al is a curious
document, and the discussion concerning said petition was
even curiouser. By Mr, Stritch’s count there are 320 signatures
on the petition. The statement charges that the interests of
the undersigned in the musical realm have been ignored, com-
promised, ridiculed and so on; the decision to bring The
Spinners to campus is a betrayal of the trust placed by the
undersigned in the members of the E.C, and the S.A.B.;
because of that “breach of contract” the appropriation of
$7500 of student funds for the concert is invalidated; and
refund of a pro rata amount should be made to each of the
undersigned, who by not stretch of the imagination plan to
attend the concert.

Well. This is indeed an interesting proposal, that if a stu-
dent dislikes the way his money is being spent, he has the
right to reclaim the amount questioned. We wonder if those
320 students were actually serious about this proposal, or
whether they saw it only as a means to vent their frustrations.

It seems to us that in the name of democracy Mr. Stritch is
suggesting a form of government known in academic circles
as anarchy. By letting each student withdraw support from
projects that gained his displeasure, it would soon become
impossible to fund any programs of respectable size, includ-

ing such things as yearbooks, on-campus films, symposia, and —

newspapers. And this is not taking the idea too far, for if
the precedent were to be set (to allow refunds on the student
activities fee) there would be no limiting its application to
the S.A.B.

Extending the idea still farther, perhaps belaboring the
point: refund that portion of a student's tuition from which
he gains no direct benefits. Since all tuition money goes into
the same bank account, a chemistry student’s money is help-
ing to support an accounting professor's salary, and so forth.
The disaster to follow a policy to prevent pooling of resources
should be evident,

We therefore hopefully conclude that the 320 students were
not serious in the specific form of the petition’s resolution ;
we assume that the petition was merely to make a ponit. What
was that point?

Obviously, to give the E.C. some vague notion of the
widespread discontent over the Spinners Decision, That point
was driven home, we thought, after last week's meeting, when
the attendance was nearly 15,000% greater than when the
.C. undertook several crucial changes in the honor system
last spring.

Then perhaps the true intent of the petition was to not
only underscore the hurt feelings but to demonstrate that a
large bloc of students oppose the concert and will boyeott
the concert, urging others to act in like fashion, .\ bos cott,
to our mind, is self-defeating. The concert may very well be
a success without the attendance of the 320, (.\nd if extra
money is lost, then there is just that much more spent now
that could conceivably be used to fund the appearance of
the rock-group-of-your-dreams.) A boycott now is an open
invitation for a counter-boyeott at the next rock concert, and
the whole concert situation would degenerate to a point where
the student body would become so fractious no concert of
repute could be scheduled.

The oft-quoted music survey of last fall was widely quoted
again on Monday night. The 60% vote in favor of rock groups
has been used as a rallying flag for the rock troops in their
battle against the soul freaks. What people forget is that
32% of the student body participated in that poll, and that
that 60% is in reality only 19.2% of the student body—if the
whole school were polled the figure might not truly reach
50%, Further, it was mentioned that the poll results were
distorted, it being claimed that, for example, one individual
filled out 30 forms in favor of rock music for concerts,

Perhaps the best suggestion of any merit to come from
these proceedings is that one ought to be able to fill out a
preference card of some sort in the fall matriculation line, We
do not agree with the proposal that monies spent on concerts
should strictly follow the proportions indicated by this poll,
but we do feel that an accurate index of student sentiment on
this issue needs to be established. We really wonder if all the
whoopin’ and hollerin’ is justified—there are many more con-
cerns which need attention than the type of band to be pro-
cured for one night out of the 230 or so nights we spend in

Lexington each year.

Jefferson and Richard

Henry Lee cavorted in Evans

By STEVE BAKER

Who'd have thought a musical
could be done so well at Wash-
ington and Lee? The prize-win-
ning musical “1776,” directed by
Dr. Al Gordon and produced by
the fine arts department last week-
end in Evans Dining Hall, offered
an entertaining evening of sonor-
ous voices and witty dialogue
amidst the signing of the Declara-
tion of Independence.

The Philadelphia setting re-
quired Evans Hall to be trans-
formed into the chamber of the
Second Continental Congress.
There Congressman John Adams
led the liberals in what seemed
a hopeless cause to declare free-
dom in the face of George III and
his British troops. Frequent posts
from General Washington at
battle in New York turned the
necessity of the freedom theme
constantly upon the players. But
the story is a familiar one, or if
not, it will be by the time the
Bicentennial rolls around.

The musical “1776” focused
more on the personal struggles
and events which ultimately led
to the signing. From the numer-
ous references to the women left
behind one got the impression that
“abstinence” was the most troubl-
ing problem among the senators.
The romantic reveries of Adams
and his wife along with the vehe-
ment protests of two original
“Virginia gentlemen,” Richard
Henry Lee and Thomas Jefferson,
gave one the feeling that if they
had gotten their much-needed
saltpetre sooner, our fledgling
country would have had the will
power to secede from the entire
North American continent.

Fortunately, as the play pro-
gressed, only Thomas Jefferson
was visited by his wife, but his
cool head was then put to work
drawing an independence docu-
ment which would meet the ap-
proval of liberals and conserva-
tives alike.

The debates over this docu-
ment encompassed some of the
finer performances in the play.
The most demanding role was
handled by Rob Mish, who played
the rabble-rousing Adams. His
stylish control reflected the play’s
alternating rhythms of the whim-
sical and the filibustering. His
voice was more than pleasing; it

Committee head asks
for student concern

Editor, the Ring-tum Phi:

The Minority Affairs Coordinat-
ing Committee was created to
serve a purpose. The purpose of
those persons on the committee is
to represent the other view point
~-the view point of the minority.
Time and time again viewpoints
within the student body that lie
in the minority have failed to be
recognized. As co-chairman of the
M.A.C.C, I see that it is the
responsibility of the committee to
change this.

That which needs to be changed
is clear to some, unclear to others.
Clearly there is a misrepresenta-
tion of minorities in numerous
areas throughout the W&L com-
munity. Many activities are car-
ried on here at W&L with very
little consideration being given
to the students who constitute the
minority. And because of this
many students chose to resign
themselves from participating in
the activities of Washington and
Lee because they see that their
cries go unheard,

This university should listen to
every utterance from within the
student body, in hopes that it
will improve the school com-
munity. The M.A.C.C. was created
to listen and listen we shall. The
M.A.C.C, is as a legitimate com-
mittee as the S.A.B., Contact or
the Executive Committee, But we
shall never know what potentials
the M.A.C.C, hold if you, the con-
cerned student, do not utilize it.

as the national sage Benjamin
Franklin was even more impres-
sive as an actor, though his voice
didn’t have quite as much power.
He was perfectly cast though, as
was Lecky Stone as the arch-
conservative John Dickenson of
Pennsylvania. Stone came across
with a powerful calmness that
aroused the audience to significant
admiration while not involving
our sympathy.

Most notable among the other
congressmen were Dan Westbrook
as Tom Jefferson, Warren Mowry
as Col. McKean of Delaware, and
Mike Armstrong as Edward Rut-
ledge of South Carolina. West-
brook’s Jefferson was a rather
passive but eloquent statesmen
only ignited by Martha Jefferson
(played by Penni Chappell). As
the thick-tongued Scotch sena-
tor Mowry showed his penchant
for the extraordinary, larger-than-
life character. His role was offset
by the meek solon, James Wilson,
played by Charles Smith. Smith’s
performance gave the play an

Dearth of student
involvement misleads

E.C., S.A.B. members

Editor, the Ring-tum Phi:

I have been at W&L for four
years. Up until last week I was
as fine an example of apathy as
you could hope to find. The straw
that broke this camel’s back was
relatively minor. The E.C. allotted
money to pay for a Spinners con-
cert. Since I do not like soul
music I began to circulate a peti-
tion asking to have my money
refunded. Yet along the way I
discovered what the real point of
the petition should be. The real
issue far and away transcends
any merely subjective musical
taste differences. I suddenly
realized that the S.A.B. and the
E.C. took no notice whatsoever of
my interests. The people I voted
for (one of whom was certainly
a mistake) did not care or even

Soul of another kind
foregone by students

To W&L via Ring-tum Phi:
Dear Dubyanel,

Did you see Delores Jones last
Monday night? I did, along with
several (as in a few) W&L stu-
dents and quite a few (as in more
than just a few) townspeople.
There should have been 500 stu-
dents there, especially since so
many of us enjoy soul music,

I have used a term that should
have been rewritten. It should say
“many of us enjoy music that
touches our souls.” Delores Jones
did just that for me. Her singing
touched my soul, and touched it
deeply. Her singing is just beauti-
ful, and many of you missed the
treat of a lifetime.

Well, if you missed it, don't
worry. The Spinners are coming.
And yes, they sing soul, too. Just
the same, if soul musie is music
that touches one’s soul, then a
lot of soul music fans have missed
a most enjoyable performance.

Sincerely,
Robert J, Smith, Jr.

ironic touch of realism: Wilson
could only muster one decision in
the three months of action the
play covered.

The only disappointing aspect
of Dan Scott’s and John Holl-
inger’s portrayals of R. H. Lee
and Gen. Washington’s Courier
was the short amount of time
they seemed to be onstage. Per-
haps it is a credit to their talent
that they seemed to be onstage
so briefly; we could have stood
much more of each of them.
Scott’s R. H. Lee was vivacious
to the point of bursting—his de-
sire to get home to his wife was
only outdone by his fondness for
the sound of his own name.
Hollinger’s performance as the
Courier interrupted the gay mood
of the play to revive the serious-
ness of events, which had been
buried beneath an entire act of
diversions and senatorial tang-
ents. The Courier’s naivete firmly
established the serious vein
within the audience’s minds and
gave the play a new degree of
substance.

“The Lees of Old Virginia”

sung by Dan Scott and John
Hollinger’s melodious ‘Momma
Look Sharp” were the best songs
in the play. They are at opposite
ends of the emotional spectrum
and bounced off each other with
a kind of emotional syncopation,

The orchestral efforts of Dr.
Gordon Spice should be lauded.
Ta assemble a viable group from
the mixed bag of musicians on
campus and in town is no small
undertaking, but the resultant
“orchestra” adquately handled
most of the score.

But most important for a play
like “1776” was the good time
had by all. It was an adventurous
enterprise as well as a success
and I look forward to the next
adventure, this time in the Lex-
ington Lime Kiln with Henrik
Ibsen’s Peer Gynt.

want to know what I| think. This
is, however, quite reasonable in
view of the fact that I had never
shown that I cared about their
activities (I hadn’t).

The real reason I presented that
petition to the E.C. involved how
well my interests and those of
people like me were represented
on that committee. I never ex-
pected to get any money back
from those guys. They don’t op-
erate that way. The point of my
petition was entirely different;
the request for a refund was
merely a means. How well do the
members of those two committees
represent you and I? How re-
sponsive are they to your voice
and mine? Unless you personally
know the members and talk to
them your answers are likely to
be negative. But how often do
you and I try to make our voices
heard? How often do we show an
interest by doing something? The
only way Clark Thompson and
Terry Atwood (villians of the
week) and your E.C. representa-
tives can know and respond to
what you want is if you and I
get off our asses and tell them.
You have to show up at meetings
and speak . . . loudly. After four
years here I learned that I made
a bad mistake. I sat back and
complained, but I did absolutely
nothing in a constructive way.
And right now when I would
like to hear my favorite music,
which is neither the Spinners or
the Dirt Band, I'm left out in
the cold. And who do I have to
blame? It’s easy to say Thomp-
son and Atwood, but that’s bull.
I've got only me to blame.

This letter has a two-fold pur-
pose. The E.C, had best pay at-
tention to the students, not just
to their friends and fraternity
brothers. The S.A.B. had best find
out what people want. Those posi-
tions are not there so you guys
can fill in blanks on a job applica-
tion. The positions and You are
there to represent and serve the
student body. However you need
input in order to realize what the
students want. To the underclass-
men who have to stay here I say
get off your asses and yell. To
the future members of the E.C.
and the S.A.B. I say listen closely;
you are there to serve, not to rule.

But the main point is that
apathy screws you over in the
end as well as all down the line,
I know: I blew it. I got from the
S.A.B. as much as | put in..
nothing. Don't relax with your
dope and beer. Get up, bitch a
little. Take polls, write and cir-

culate petitions. If they screw
you let them know. This ‘support
the guy we voted for’ doesn’t al-
ways work. Who all voted for
Nixon? These people can only act
if you talk to them; do it. They
can only work if you give them
something to work with; do it.
Only through encouragement and
complaint can anything be done.
Student activism need not die. It’s
the only weapon you have.

Sincerely,

T. Michael Stritch Jr. '76

Your suggestion of more stu-
dent involvement is a positive
one. If people cared, if they
bothered to attend an occasional
E.C. or S.A.B. meeting, then
some constructive ideas might
be developed. Complaining long
and loud after a decision is
made does little good; involve-
ment in the decision-making
does some good.

I distinctly remember elements of
all the diverse fragments which
made up the student body en-
joying music of all kinds. It could
happen now, but I guess we'll
never have the opportunity to
find out.

Even though it’s not my money
being abused for this Spinners
gig, as an alumnus and member
of the community here, I never-
theless feel cheated, and even
more than cheated, I feel asham-
ed to have to confess to hopefully
ignorant people out there in the
real world that I am part of this
travesty of liberal arts education
where the administration has
such an easy time of things be-
cause they have students to do
their dirty work.

As a positive alternative, |
would suggest opening up the
SAB leadership and membership
to a wider cross-section of the
student body. Only then will the
worms be pushed into their proper
minority.

Sincerely,
W. Patrick Hinely, '73

Calling the current $.A.B.
members “worms” is not help-
ing in any rational discussion
of the music problem.

Ballplayers drop two;
season record slumps

By SAMMY THOMPSON

After winning the first three
games of the season, Washington
and Lee’s baseball team has lost
five out of its last six contests
dropping their record to 4-5.

Oneonta State handed the Gen-
erals their latest defeat Friday,
6-1. Left-fielder Nels Kaupilla led
W&L’s opponents with five hits in
as many trips to the plate. Kau-
pilla only needed one more hit to
have as many as all the Generals’
batters combined.

Oneonta broke up a one-run ball
game in the top of the sixth with
a bases-loaded double off W&L’s
ace pitcher Dan Westbrook. Be-
fore Westbrook could retire the
side, Oneonta came up with four
runs to increase their lead to 5-0.

The only W&L run came in the
eighth as freshman Chuck D’Aurio

led off with a walk. David Hundley
moved him to second with a bunt
and senior captain Ben Bona-
ventura singled D’Aurio home.

Thursday, the Generals suc-
cumbed miserably at the hands
of their Lexington neighbor, VMI.
The Keydets bombarded W&L
with 11 runs while, at the same
time, holding the Generals score-
less.

John Sanford went the distance
on the mound for VMI allowing
only four hits while Billy Young
led the Keydets‘ offense with two
doubles, a walk and two runs
batted in.

The Generals’ defense seemed
to have their minds on other
things—exams maybe? Anyway,
W&L committed five errors and
three different W&L pitchers gave
up a total of nine walks.

Navy victorious;
exhibition Friday

By JOHN HUGHES

Rated eighth in the country in
the latest national poll, the la-
crosse team hopes to get back
on the winning trial with a pair
of home games this week —
Wednesday against Virginia Tech
and Friday with the Australian
All-Stars.

The Generals, now 3-2 for the
year, lost a spine-tingling 8-7 de-
cision to fourth-ranked Navy last
Saturday in Annapolis after the
Midshipmen’s Mike Canders fired
in the winning goal with just 16
seconds remaining.

Coach Jack Emmer’s team twice
fought back from three-goal defi-
cits, the last time overcoming
a 7-4 Navy lead with three straight
goals, the last one Rob Morgan’s
third goal of the day with just
1:29 remaining in the game.

Soon after that, W&L was
found guilty of a holding infrac-
tion, and Navy then scored the
winning goal in an extra-man
situation.

W&L did not play well in the
early part of the game, and Navy
took a 3-0 lead, yet W&L’s strong
defense kept them within range,
and the Generals tied it, 3-3, after
two quick goals by Morgan and
Jack Dudley just before the half,
and another by Don Carroll early
in the third quarter.

Navy then spurted to three-
goal leads of 63 and 7-4, and
again W&L rallied to tie, 7-7, on
a goal by Jay Sindler and two
more by Morgan. That set the

stage

for the last minute dra-
matics.

The defense by both teams was
outstanding, particularly in the
goal. W&L’s Charlie Brown had
18 saves, while Navy’s Bill Mueller
was equally as spectacular with
16 saves.

Local lacrosse fans will have a

chance to see what promises to
be an outstanding game Friday
when the Aussies invade Wilson
Field for a 3:00 p.m. faceoff. The
Australians feature some of the
best lacrosse players in that
country, which was host to the
World Championship Games two
years ago. The United States all-
star team that won that 1974
World Tournament _ included
former W&L players Skeet Chad-
wick and Ted Bauer, and W&L
coach Jack Emmer helped coach
the squad.

To help offset the Australians’
expenses in their tour of the
U.S., and also to help pay for a
return visit of U.S. all-star players
to Australia, there will be a
nominal admission charge to Fri-
day's game.

Advance tickets, all $1.00 gen-
eral admission, will be available
at the W&L athletic office until
5:00 p.m. today. At the gate, the
tickets will be $2.00 for adults
and $1.00 for high school stu-
dents and under.

The Keydets scored three runs
in the second inning, two in the
third, two in the fourth, one in
the fifth and ended the merry-
go-round with three in the sixth.

Senior Bob Carpentier threw
the first three innings for the
Generals and was relieved by
Mike Rhoads in the fourth and
Bill Gregg in the seventh.

The Generals played Lynch-
burg College Monday and Hamp-
den-Sydney yesterday for their
final games before the spring
break.

Podgajny,
Canfield gain
top honors

Star player John Podgajny and
coach Verne Canfield of champ-
ion Washington and Lee were
voted basketball “Player-of-the-
Year” and “Coach-of-the-Year” in
the Virginia College Athletic As-
sociation’s Division III.

W&L’s Generals swept through
the eight-team Division III play
with a 13-1 record and finished
19-7 overall. Podgajny, the team
captain and a senior from Chester,
Pa., led the team in scoring with
a 17.7 scoring average.

For Canfield, it was the 10th
straight season the Generals have
posted a winning record. In that
span, his teams have won 168 and
lost 83, a percentage of .669.

Joining Podgajny on the All-
VCAA team, as voied by the as-
sociation’s coaches, are Jim Craw-
ford of Lynchburg, Dick Ponti of
Hampden-Sydney, Steve Brown of
Christopher Newport and Tom
Wright of Bridgewater.

Those five were the top scorers
in the Division, with Crawford
heading the list with a 25.5 aver-
age, Wright at 21.8, Podgajny at
17.7, Ponti at 16.0 and Brown at
15.9. Ponti led all rebounders
with a 13.8 mark, followed closely
by Wright at 13.7.

The six-man second team in-
cludes Bob Flint of W&L, Ed
Tiernan of Hampden-Sydney, Del
Battle of Virginia Wesleyan,
Wayne Davis of Lynchburg,
Davvid Hutcheon of Christopher
Newport and Dennis Gibson of
Bridgewater.

Making honorable mention were
Mike Wenke of W&L, Mike Clark
of Emory & Henry, Otis Jordan
of Virginia Wesleyan, Marty Me-
Nerney of Hampden-Sydney, Tom
Selinger of Lynchburg and Steve
Allen of Eastern Mennonite.
