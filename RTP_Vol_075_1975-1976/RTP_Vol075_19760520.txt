Volume LXXV

By TOM RENTSCHLER

The University switchboard
operator, the head of reference
in MeCormick Library, the retir-
ing secretary to the dean of the
law school and the senior co-
chairman of the Mock Conven-
tion received Ring-tum Phi
Awards at last Thursday’s meet-
ing of the senior class.

The annual awards are present-
ed by the newspaper to members
of the faculty, staff, and student
body in recognition of contribu-
tions made to the academic and
extracurricular life on campus.

Usually the awards are given
to several people whom the paper
feels deserve more recognition
than they have received.

Ring-tum Phi editor S. Yevich,
who presented the awards, ex-
plained that “no specific criteria
for selection are mandated, but it
is understood that each recipient
should have imparted on the W&L
community a bit of him or her-
self, exhibiting to the students
here that ‘little extra’ that goes
beyond what is required by duty
or position. Therefore the awards
were given to four individuals
who have all helped the university
in their own particular way.”

Receiving the first award was
an individual whose face is un-
known to most, but whose pleas-
ant and courteous voice has been
heard by virtually all at some
time or another. As switchboard
operator, Mrs. Agnes K. Gilmore
has added many a bright “good
morning” to the lives of virtually
every member of the W&L com-
munity.

But Mrs. Gilmore’s service to
the university ranges far beyond
her duties as switchboard opera-
tor. She is always glad to give
helpful information to people who
stop by her office in Payne Hall,
and she has often been of great
assistance to the English depart-
ment.

Second among the four recipi-
ents was Barbara Brown, associate
professor and head of reference
and public services in MeCormick
library. Miss Brown has aided
many students in researching
term papers and this year she
initiated a program to help
humanities and science students
find their way among the vast
stacks of reference material.

For the 1974-75 academic year
Miss Brown trained at UCLA in
a program which recognizes ex-
ceptional management potential
in the field of library science. She
is also a member of the board of
publishers of Shenandoah, W&L’s
literary quarterly.

Perhaps the one recipient who
has been the most devoted in her
service to the University is a
lady who has served the Wash-
ington and Lee Law school for
three decades, and who will re-
tire at the end of the current
academic year. Secretary to five
law deans, Mrs. Catherine Mc-
Dowell has helped many a student
in academic matters and _ in
preparation to enter the legal
profession.

Mrs. McDowell was recently
honored by the establishment of
a full tuition scholaship in the

law school in her name. Notably,
her husband was a member of the
law faculty for 41 years, and her
two sons are both distinguished
alumni of W&L.

Finally, the recipient of the stu-
dent award, which traditionally
goes to a member of the senior
class, was given to one of the
most politically active individuals
at W&L. Marston Reed Morgan, a
political science major, was co-
chairman of the Mock Convention
steering committee and was presi-
dent of the Convention.

Hlaving worked last summer for
Congressman Don Riegle of Michi-
gan, Morgan was well qualified to
give a great share of the guidance
for the plans of the $32,000 1976
Mock Democratic Convention. Of
course his most difficult duty may
well have been the task of presid-
ing over the convention, a task
which he handled admirably.

Abandoned kiln to be site for [Ibsen drama

By GRAY COLEMAN

The Troubadour Theatre will
wind up its eventful season with
a presentation of Peer Gynt, a
production of Henrik Ibsen’s ro-
mantic fantasy-epic, to be per-
formed by the Total Theatre
(Drama 139) class on May 24-26.

The location for the play is
the ruins of the old Lexington
Lime Kiln, a facility which oper-
ated within the last 50 years. In
recent years it has been seldom
used, aside from the renowned

Liberty Hall bicentennial noted

W&L marked a very special
bicentennial of its own last week
~—the 200th anniversary of its
carly name, Liberty Hall, repre-
senting the first official endorse-
ment of independence’ from
Britain by any educational insti-
tution in the Colonies.

The tiny, struggling classical
school was 27 years old in May,
1776, when trustees adopted the
new, revolutionary title.

It was two months before the
Declaration of Independence
would be signed. The school’s
name change “was a bold act of
defiance,” according to to an ac-
count by W&L’s 19th-century
historian, William Henry Ruffner,
“for up to this time the British
flag floated over the capital of
Virginia.”

AED initiates members

The Virginia Beta Chapter of
Alpha Epsilon Delta, the interna-
tional honorary pre-medical so-
ciety, held its annual spring initia-
tion Tuesday in Parmly Hall.

The following are the new mem-
bers: James Christmas, Landon
Garland, Marshall Jemison, John
Sacco, Philip Bailey, Mark Duncan,
Robert Jackson, Robert MeCord,
Robert Mucciola, David Trice,
Keith Teel, Shelby Bailey, Joel

Loving, William Burton, Brew
Houston, Chris Attinger, James
Ballou, Buddy Brothers, John

Cheairs, Michael Clary, Lee Gins-
burgh, Chris Johnson, Andrew
Dickens, and Howdy Knipp.

Following the ceremony the
members heard a speech from
Dr. Norman J. Knorr of the Uni-
versity of Virginia

No one is certain exactly how
or even when, the change came
about. In the minutes of the
trustees’ executive committee
meeting on May 8, 1776, the school
is still referred to as Augusta
Academy. In the minutes of the
same committee five days later,
on May 13, however, the institu-
tion is termed Liberty Hall.

According to Ruffner, “We are
left to surmise as to just when
and how the change was made,
but as the institution was then
not incorporated, probably there
was no legal difficulty in the way
of a change of name by anybody
having official control over the
school.... This band of patriots,
as we may reasonably suppose, on
the oceasion of the (May 13, 1776)
meeting, gave to the... school the
stirring name of Liberty Hall
Academy. Most likely the name
was suggested by Graham” —
William Graham, chief officer of
the school from 1774 to 1796.

The name Liberty Hall lasted
20 years——through the Revolution-
ary War and birth of the republic,
into George Washington's presi-
dency. In 1796 the Father of his
country rescued from bankruptcy
the school that had sided with
the forces of independence, by
donating stock eventually valued
at $50,000, and grateful trustees,
“this band of patriots,” changed
the name again to honor Wash-
ington.

Still fresh from his smash-hit
of last March, 1776, Dr. Al Gordon
returns to the director’s chair for
what may well be another suc-
cess, weather permitting. He ex-
plains the action of the play as
follows:

“Peer Gynt, the main character
of Ibsen’s fantasy, is a man who
will not commit himself to any
cause or person, and who ulti-
mately becomes selfless. His fate
is to be neither rewarded nor
punished, but to be melted down

by the Button Molder, who
pursues him throughout the
piece.”

The drama centers on Peer’s

adventures in Norway and Africa,
and calls for a set consisting of
piles of ruins. The Lime Kiln was

Whiteheads honored
with Lynchburg Citation

Mr. and Mrs. James Walter
Whitehead were recently awarded
the highest honor any Washing.
ton and Lee University alumni
chapter awards, the annual Lynch-
burg Citation.

Whitehead is treasurer of W&L,
secretary of the board of trustees,
and chairman of the university's
American Bicentennial Commit
tee. Together, the Whiteheads
have been responsible for bring
ing the Reeves Collection of 18th
and 19th century Chinese export
porcelain at W&L to a place of
nationwide significance among art
connoisseurs

The citation recognizes the
Whieheads’ “signal contributions
to the enrichment of life through
out the university community in
sensing opportunities for develop
ing unique new dimensions of
fiduciary feasance through the
symbiosis of finance and fine arts

by enhancing the aesthetic,
eultural and material value (of
WA&L’s art treasures); in strength
ening the university's image of
gentility and felicity by graci
ously opening their home and
their hearts to all friends and
patrons of Washington and Lee
and in perpetuating the excellence

of the past and faithfully honor-
ing tradition while always re
maining ‘not unmindful of the
future’.”

Primary among those exhibi-
tions is the current two-year
nationwide tour of 200 pieces
from the collection associated with
the American Revolution. That
traveling display is sponsored by
the Smithsonian Institution.

The Whiteheads were also the

naturally a logical choice, with its
series of high walls and caves.
Adaptations to the setting were
carried out by set-designer Walter
Romanchuk and technical direc-
tors Jim Moyler and Jim Feinman,
Dr. Gordon will also be assisted
by stage manager John Jacobsen
in his administrative chores.

Also, in such a fantastic pro-
duction, costumes and make-up
will be ambitious and imagina-
tive. Carried out by Hunt Brown
and Taylor Harbison (for cos-
tumes), and Brian Garr and John-
ny Hargrove (for make-up), work
is proceeding smoothly for the
approximately 50 different out-
fit sets.

Another point worth noting is
that the widow and daughter of
the translator, Kai Jurgensen, will
be present at the performances.
In previous years, Mr. Jurgensen
was a colleague of Dr. Gordon's
at the University of North Car-
olina.

Performances will be at 8:30
p.m. each night, and there is a
possibility of holding the show
over for one extra performance
on Thursday night, depending on
demand.

E.C. suggests action

on equipment removals

By JOE FITZGERALD

The Executive Committee voted
unanimously Monday night to
recommend that persons who have
checked out equipment from the
gym and not returned it be pre-
vented from matriculating or
graduating until the articles are
returned or replaced.

The vote followed a report from
E.C. junior representative and
secretary- elect Radar Davis that
damages, thefts and misplace-
ments in the gymnasium are well
above the $1000 figure quoted at
last week's meeting.

Property removed or stolen in-
cludes 700 towels costing $2 each,
$311 worth of equipment checked
out and never retnrued, 12 wall
clocks, two trash cans, two public
address speakers, weights, folding
chairs, a Virginia flag, and 30,000
bars of soap.

Davis said the soap was sup-
posed to last the entire year
but was gone by the end of the
Fall term. He also reported that
folding chairs are “popular” in
fraternity houses and that “People
don't take these towels seriously
at all.”

Davis also said that over $2000
worth of damage has been done
to the sound system at Wilson
Field.

Calyx editor outlines

organization of volume

By MALCOLM GRAHAM

Bill Thomson, this year’s editor-
in-chief of the Calyx, recently an-
nounced the final plans for the
publication, to be distributed on
or around May 21.

“This year’s format is one of
the most organized we’ve had in
several years,” commented Thom-
son. “There will be no gimmicks,
no records, and no games. Instead,
we tried to rely on good photo-
graphy. This was always our
strongest point, and it’s about time
we exploited it to the fullest.”

Not only can the new Calyx
claim an innovative format, it is
also the first yearbook to include
a Mock Convention spread in the
Same year as the convention it-
self. “It was necessary to twist a
few arms, but we have seven
impressive pages as a result,” said
the editor.

In addition to Thomson, others
who gave a great deal of their

Letters
To he Editor

Editor, the Ring-tum Phi:

In regard to your article on the
Mock Convention Parade, specific-
ally the order in which the floats
were to appear. Somewhere, some-
body along the line didn’t do their
research. Your article states, ‘““The
floats were arranged in the order
of a state’s entrance into the
union ...”. I watched the parade,
but I observed that this was not
the case. Delaware was the first
state in the United States, “the
state that started a Nation...”,
and the float for Delaware was
nowhere near the front. So, be
it your mistake or someone else’s,
I thought it my duty as a Dela-
warean and American to clarify
who got the ball rolling on this
continent.

Respectfully,
Reynolds “Ace” Dods 78

It was our understanding that
floats would be in the order
in which the states entered the
Union, with the exception of
Virginia, which was to lead the
parade; however, due to prob-
lems getting the floats in order
at the high school, some floats
paraded out of their assigned
position.

For those whose impatience can-
not be curbed, the Calyx will
feature eight color photo pages,
a good deal more written com-
mentary on activities and organi-
zations than last year, and a
traditional Colonnade-cover. Ac-

Washington and Lee proved it
could win a big lacrosse game in
a convincing fashion Saturday,
dominating arch-rival Virginia all
over the field to record a 15-9
decision that moved the Generals
into the NCAA lacrosse tourna-
ment for a fifth consecutive year.

W&L, 9-4, drew undefeated
Cornell in the first round, played
yesterday in Ithaca, N.Y.

The win was also the fourth in
a row for the Generals over the
Cavaliers, 5-5, who saw their
playoff hopes ended by a five-
goal second-period outburst by
W&L.

“Our kids turned in a dominat-
ing performance,” W&L coach
Jack Emmer said, indicating the
Generals probably had their best
game of the season.

The final outcome could have
been more lopsided except for
three unanswered goals midway
through the third period by Vir-

Delts establish fund

Delta Tau Delta social fra-
ternity has established an annuity
valued at almost $12,000 to benefit
its long-time employee, Reid
Colbert.

The annuity was presented to
Mr. Colbert at ceremonies in his
honor during the recent W&L
alumni weekend. He was the guest
of honor at a party of alumni
and current students at the fra-
ternity house and was also singled
out for special recognition at the
lacrosse game later that day.

Mr. Colbert has worked for
Delta Tau Delta for 43 years. The
annuity which current members
and alumni of the local chapter
have funded will provide an in-
come for him and his wife when
he retires.

Leaders in the campaign to raise
funds for the annuity were Paul
Cromelin, president of the fra-
ternity last year, and Mynders
Glover, treasurer. Working with
them was an advisory committee
of Delta Tau Delta alumni who
are now members of W&L’s fac-
ulty and administration, including
President Robert E. R. Huntley,
Admissions Director James D.

Richard given award
for creative writing

The English department has an-
nounced that only one award was
made this year in the Mahan
Creative Writing contest: the
award for sophomore prose which
was won by Mark Richard, class of
1978, for an untitled short story.
The award is good for a prize
of sixty dollars in cash (or a
deduction of one hundred dollars
from next year’s tuition costs).

Very, very few entries for this
year’s contest were received, a
disappointment to the judges. But
the department hopes that next
year will bring a major revival
of student interest.

Those students whose entries
were not awarded prizes may pick
up their manuscripts from the
secretary of the English depart-
ment in Payne 31.

ginia, cutting W&L’s 10-3 margin
down to four.

“We lost our edge a couple of
times in the second half,’ Emmer
said, “But both times we got a
quick goal that put us back in
command.”

W&L was able to control the
ball for most of the rain-plagued
contest because of the work of
freshman Jim (Mario) Babcock,
who controlled 20 of 28 faceoffs
to earn the game ball.

“Sure it was fun to have a
game like that against Virginia,”
Babcock said. He credited assist-
ant coach Dave Cranshaw with
spotting a flaw in his technique
that was preventing him from win-
ning many of his faceoffs.

Once the Generals had the ball,
they had little trouble sticking it
in the goal. The attack trio of
Rob Morgan, Jeff Fritz, and Chris
Kearney combined for ten goals,
while midfielder Donny Carroll
contributed four tallies and a
pair of assists.

in contrast, the high-scoring
Cavalier attack managed just one
goal in settled situations against
the W&L defense, which drew
words of praise from Virginia
coach Glenn Thiel.

“Tommy Keigler and Rob Lind-
sey are two of the best—in my
mind, they’re first-team All-Ameri-
cans,” Thiel said, adding that both
John Strock and goalie Charlie
Brown also had place somewhere
on the A-A team.

Brown turned in a solid per-
formance in the nets, making 14
saves and outplaying his Virginia
counterpart, Cam MacLachlan,
who appeared shaken after the
Generals’ second-period barrage.

After taking a 2-1 first quarter
lead, W&L blew the game open

Thursday, May 20, 1976

Generals demolish Wahoos

with five goals in as many minutes
early in the second stanza. Both
of Kearney’s scores came in that
period, including one which barely
rolled across the goal line past
a fallen MacLachlan.

The Generals appeared to be
headed for a runaway just after
intermission, as Morgan scored
twice while Fritz saw an at-
tempted pass end up behind Mac-
Lachlan to give W&L a 10-3 lead.

But the Wahoos came back with
four of the next five scores, in-
cluding a pair by Emmet Voelkel,
to stay in the game at 11-7.

Fritz and Carroll opened the
final period with goals on isola-
tion moves to increase the lead
to 13-7. Virginia again closed the
gap somewhat as Paul O’Brien

and Bruce Baker scored just 10
seconds apart midway through the
quarter.

The W&L defense then stopped
several Virginia scoring chances
before Morgan and Carroll salted
the game away with goals in the
final three minutes.

Little went wrong for the Gen-
erals, who were urged on _ by
nearly all of the 4500 hundred
fans in attendance.

All were in Scott Stadium to
see W&L “beat them damn Wa-
hoos,” but the win was put in
perspective by All-American Lind-
sey, who throttled Virginia’s Kris
Snider for the entire afternoon.
“That’s the Wahoos,” the Gen-
erals’ tri-captain said. “Now, who’s
next?”
