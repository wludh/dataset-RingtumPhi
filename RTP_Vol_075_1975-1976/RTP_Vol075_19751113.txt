Contact seeks additional funds;
hopes to sign Truman Capote

By JOK

FITZGERALD

Bill Flesher appeared before the
Executive Committee Monday night
to ask for $2400 in order to bring
Truman Capote to campus as part
of the Contact °76 series.

Phe E.C, delayed the vote until
Kesher can look into the possiblity

funds from other
such as parental contribu-
tions and money from other speak-
both at W&L and at near
by colleges,

\nother reason for postponing the
appropriation to give the E.C,
time to find out whether students
want their money spent to bring the
noted author to W&L.

Capote’s appearance, if he is sign-
ed by Contact, would follow” the
publication of new books by the
Writer in January and February,

In other business the E.C. decided
to comtinue discussion of the W&L
calendar at their next meeting.

The decision to continue the talks
came following a few minutes of
debate concerning whether — the
Winter break should be shortened,
discontinued, moved to a later date
in the term, or left the way it is.

Bobby Pugh argued against a sug

that the vacation be moved
to eight weeks into the term instead
of six. He cited the fact that the
E.C, would be forced to amend the
section of the student body constitu-
tion dealing with elections.

The proposed change in the sched-
uling of the break would have
seeking office filing — for
candidacy the week before the break,
and the elections falling on the Mon-
day afterwards.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
Thursday, November 13, 1975

Is a thief
a man of honor?

The letter concerning the Honor System printed elsewhere
on this page brings to the fore a point that has been disturbing
us for some time: students are gradually drifting away from
embracing the basic belief that a code of honor should include
lying and theft as violations (as well as cheating and plag-
iarism), or at least that is the impression that they are con-
veying to their elected Executive Committee representatives

who administer the system.

How cana thief be equated with an honorable man? Honor
ignifies a keen sense of ethical conduct, according to our
dictionary and our common sense, Since when is thievery
considered ethical conduct?

‘To lie is to willfully deceive, to provide false information,
It this ethical? Is this honorable?

We cannot ascribe to the twisted logic that lauds honor
on the one hand but tramples it on the other. Either a man
is honorable in all that he does or he is nothing more than a
dishonorable man. He cannot leave his honor in the class-
room with his pledged paper; he cannot “lift” an ashtray
from Fairfax Lounge or “borrow” some money from another
person and in good conscience call himself an honorable man
worthy of attending this University.

Honor cannot be quantified by degree; transgressions
against its spirit cannot be codified. One cannot say: This act
is an honor violation, but that act, which violates the same
principle to a lesser degree, is not.” Honor is not a nebulous
contruct of the philosophical or idealistic intellect—it is
a vibrant, positive framework around which one’s character
can be built.

Any dishonorable act, particularly in reference to stealing,
is worthy of referral to the Executive Committee, no matter
how insignificant the act might appear on the surface. Will
an ashtray thief always stick to pocketing such paltry and
relatively worthless loot? Will the individual who on the one
hand abrogates his pact of honor (implicit in his attendance
at Washington and Lee) abide by the system in all other
respects ?

lt is argued that perhaps if a graduated penalty scale were
introduced better enforcement of the Honor System would be
the result. We disagree with this premise, Putting aside con-
siderations of the sheer magnitute of establishing the penal-
ties and correlating those punishments to specific crimes, we
feel that the installation of such a system would defeat the
whole purpose of the Honor System, Our collegiate com-
munity should by nature be idealistic; college is the prose-
lytizing influence which gives our idealism room in which to
find visible expression. Making concessions to the tainted
“real world” by diluting the strength of our beliefs would
work against us. We would leave this place with second-rate

ideals, and our contribution to society as individuals with

integrity would be second-rate.

Chere are some who favor the total abandonment of all
precepts of an administered Honor System, To those we must
the
considerations mean nothing to you? If so, why did you decide

instead on a stray alley
Which belonged to a former
tenent of the room, He is unable to
form relationships with other people,
but he is able to control his fricnd-
ship with the cat to the point where
it no longer threatens him,

The Litthe Man is visited by an
Old Man, the Landlady’s father-in-
law, Feeble and nearly blind, the
Old Man is totally disillusioned with
modern industrial society and its
insatiable appetite for profit. He is
finally carted away when his ravings
against “the bosses” disturb the other
roomers, but the audience is forced
in the end to acknowledge that the
Old Man is the most sane and
perceptive character in the play.

The Strangest Kind of Romance
is directed by Brian Garr, with the
assistance of Rick McHan as Stage
Manager and in a minor acting role.
‘The cast also includes Rob Mish as
Little Man, Lecky Stone as Old Man,
Marti Marcucei as the Landlady, and
Bill Hirshman as the Boxer.
