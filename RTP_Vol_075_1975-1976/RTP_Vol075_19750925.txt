2 THE RING-TUM PHI

 

   

OUTLOOK andREVIEW.

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Of purse strings...

The budget for 1975-76, as reported on the first page, was
voted on by the Executive Committee in a special session last
Thursday evening. Although a second vote has to be taken,
it can be assumed that the budget as it now stands will be
ratified.

Standing committees’ requests were pared from $54,049.44
to $48,320.00. The requests for funding made by other groups
were denied and the groups were advised to seek aid from the
new Executive Committee Funding account. EC Funding,
in the amount of $4,500, will be used to handle special requests
that may be made during the year by various organizations
or individuals. It will accomplish approximately the same
ends as the ill-fated Five Dollar Proposal in a much simpler,
more expedient manner,

It is interesting to note that the Executive Committee
allotted roughly a $500 increase for its own operating budget.
Last year’s EC overspent its budget by about fifty per cent—
while that group used some of its funds to finance small re-
quests, requests that will now fall under the EC Funding
plan, the overrun of $800 on a planned budget of $1500 was
substantial. With the segregation of special funding requests
into a separate account, we hope that the current EC will
monitor its own finances as closely as its members plan to
monitor the expenditures made by other organizations. Par-
ticularly in light of the increase it gave itself, the EC should
spend its monies judiciously so as to avoid charges of padding
its own budget at other committees’ expense.

.. and parties

While we are on the subject of budgets: we were distress-
ed to note the death of banquets provided for in the budgets
submitted for approval. In particular, the Publications Board
Banquet and the fete always thrown by the Executive Com-
mittee in honor of itself (and justifiably so) are sorely lacking
in this year’s budgets. Only last year the Senior Banquet met
its demise, and now two of the few remaining pat-oneself-
on- the-back affairs have joined the ranks of the late and great.

Washington and Lee, the haven of the Gentleman's C in
academics and A in socializing, is rapidly being transformed
into a campus whose calendar is devoid of any banquets to
recognize those (but admittedly not all of those) who inject
into this university much of their time and effort to provide
a congenial atmosphere in which one may leisurely pursue
a bachelor’s or juris doctor's degree.

Inflation constitutes the bulk of the increase in this year’s
budget, and thus “frivolous” and “wasteful” banquets were
among the first items to be stricken from the list. Ah, the
Age of Extravagance is gone forever, and the Age of Thrift
has usurped its place.

Restraint

The perennial problem of unauthorized townspeople using
University facilities and attending “closed” parties is again
plaguing various facility administrators and fraternity offi-
cials. Specifically, usage of the tennis courts, the University
Center, and admission to combo parties are the areas of
concern at the moment.

Regarding the tennis courts, on which space is competed
for by W&L, VMI, and citizens of Lexington, Coach Miller
is having signs printed which explain the University’s policy
and order of precedence, which hopefully will alleviate the
arguments concerning rights to use the courts.

In the University Center the main problem is with children
roaming free, occasionally damaging furniture and generally
causing trouble, Here students are asked to firmly but tact-
fully request that unauthorized persons leave. (Townspeople
have the right to use the Cockpit, but no other facilities are
available to them.) In most cases the juvenile trespassers will
leave with little persuasion—in infrequent imstances a more
imposing authority figure may have to be summoned to
remedy the situation.

The stickist problem concerns combo parties at fraternity
houses. In recent weeks there have been petty
larceny, damage to property, and an outbreak of violence in at
least one instance. Extreme care in choosing one’s words and
a high degree of tact are needed in situations where non-
fraternity members are making nuisances of themselvs.

A majority of the time there is no trouble between towns-
folk and fraternity members, and the presence of outsiders
is not intrusive, But there are occassional troublemakers who

CAaSCS of

are doing nothing but increasing the animosity between mem
hers of the University and members of the community,

We ask that uninvited persons who are making themselves
unwanted be politely but firmly asked to leave. Do not be
unreasonable or condescending in tone when requesting that
they depart, for they too are only there to enjoy the party.
Students frequently comment that they are somewhat appre
hensive to ask townspeople to leave, fearing retaliation later i
the evening. To this we must reply that most people are
rational beings, and if asked in a polite and gentlemanly fash
ion they will respond similarly,

Most of those who have been showing up at combo parties
are just people looking for a good time, not for a fight. For
the sake of promoting amicable relations between the Uni
versity and Lexington, we urge restraint in dealing with situa

tions of this type.

Noell on Honor

The following is an edited tran-
script of comments by Dean William
1. Noell Jv., coordinator of the
freshman year, describing the Honor
System at Washington and Lee Uni-
versily,

The Honor System—or at least the
concept of honor—has been operative
at Washington and Lee at least since

General Lee’s time, Most of us, I
think, have tended to characterize
the System as one which — says,

essentially, that an honorable man
doesn't lie; he doesn't cheat; he
doesn't steal, No one means to suggest
by that that this simple formula-
tion of the Honor System is the be-
all and the end-all in the sense that
this is all the Honor System might
comprehend,

I have long felt that one of the
enduring strengths of the System
is the fact that the administration of
the System is entirely in the hands
of the students, ‘There is simply no
way in which members of the faculty
or administration become involved,
except to the extent that they may
be called upon to report a suspect-
ed violation, After that, however,
the to whether or not
particular conduct does in faet con-
travene the spirit of the Honor
System is left entirely to students,
Phere is no way the faculty or mem-
bers of the administration can over-
ride that decision...

decision as

I know that Honor Systems are
not in vogue any more; a number
are collapsing; a number are the

subject of legal challenge. TP've often
asked myself why Washington and
Lee's continues to be strong, or at
least as strong as I think it is, 1
suspect I've already suggested one

reason, and that is the extent to
Which we trust students to operate
it, so that some change in values
and some change in mores are
constantly reflected in the judgments
that students make. It’s not a system
that is imposed from the outside,
by “us” on “them.” They are the
ones who make it operate; they are
the ones who make the critical
judgments,

But 1 suspect as well that there
is a second reason why our System
is strong: the size of the Washington
and Lee student body . is such
that a sense of community can, and
does, exist. We have students largely

with shared values, to whom the
concept of personal integrity and
honor is important, It’s probably

difficult in’ a larger environment to
create that sense of shared purpose,
that sense of togetherness, that sense
of the importance of integrity.

Ask Traveller

 

Confused, naive girl: “What's all that noise coming from that fraternity

house?”
‘Traveller: “That's what

is called the

Rite of Rush. [It occurs every year

about this time, It is analagous to the coming of the locusts, for it
brings to the campus a flood of females, a flood of beer, and above all
a flood of confusion on the part of the freshman class,”

Girl, after venturing inside the house: “What is al Ithat shouting going on,
and why is that guy with the card on getting a can of beer shoved
down his thoat, while everybody yells CHUG Tt, CHUG, CHUG,
CHUG?! Are they imitating a train or something?”

‘Traveller: “No, that’s what is called pledging, and it involves paying about
$25 a month to get your body bruised and battered by a bunch of
people rather cuphemistically called brothers.”

Slightly less naive girl: “Why is that crummy band playing “Jungle Boogie”
five times in a row, while a bunch of delirious people jump up and

down like a band of Zulu: warriors?”

‘Traveller: “That's what is called a combo, and is mainly attended by
outrageously drunk people who seem to try to get as much beer spilled
on the floor as they get in their mouth, [It is also attended by a strange
beast called a gatorer who does a strange dance called gatoring, which
sometimes causes dates to flee W&L with looks of disgust and horror on

their innocent, naive faces.”

Informed girl “Well, it does a great job of mopping the floor!”

A deli in Old Main ?
Hot pastrami on rye

By JAY MeCANN

One is inclined to locate a Lex-
ington Deli somewhere — between
Third and Park Avenues, and one

hardly expects to find such an eatery
in Lexington, Virginia. But thanks to
Jerry Darrell, the Commons Czar,
the town of Lexington does, indeed,
have a delicatessen, albeit mas-
querading as “The Old Main Sand-
wich Shoppe.”

Phat the name “Sandwich Shoppe”

over the more concen-
tional “Delicatessen” should come as
no surprise; the natives have lately
shown an infatuation with — the
affectedly colonial, To sell portraits
of the Pope in Lexington they might
have to be labelled “Harry Truman
in Full Masonic Regalia,’ or so the
jokes goes. To promote a deli, it
might have to be called a “Sand-
wich Shoppe,” but “a rose by any
other name ef cetera.”

The Washington and Lee student,

Bruce Springsteen: new Dylan?

 

Zappa returns to conventional

By JOHN JACKLEY

Born to Run

I suppose I too should join the
common cry and proclaim Bruce
Springsteen as the new rock star of
the Seventies, destined to dominate
rock for the foreseeable future while
reaching new heights of artistic
achievement. Well . he's receiv-
ing a lot of hype from Columbia
Records, but somehow it just doesn't
succeed, Born To Run is his third
album and although not a bad LP
(i wouldn't leave a room if some-
one put it on their stereo), it hardly
qualifies him as the next Dylan.

Enough of the conceptual biases,
For those who admire Bruce Spring-
steen, Born To Run is a milestone
in his career, Springsteen rises above
the cult level—although widespread—
and finally reaches appeal in the
mass audience, He does this with-
out changing his style to accom:
modate commercial tastes, and suc:
ceeds in retaining his original follow-
ers along with the more recently
converted devotees.

Most of his songs are about New
Jersey street life, and “Born To Run”
is no exception, “We ride through

place is a new Zappa who should
reach mass appeal in a few more
albums (and thus probably open to
more charges of commercialism),

Zappa was born in Baltimore, but
seems to have been weaned from his
khakis and topsiders at an early age.
He reportedly admires Edgar Varese,
a contemporary classical composer.
Zappa originally wanted to do a
single twenty-volume set of albums,
but was discouraged by his record
company. He does most of his
recordings in his basement studio,
and refrains from the use of all
drugs. He has two children, Dweasle
and Moonunit (honest).

His theory holds that music is all
along one continuum, that all mo-
tion is musical motion, generated
around one single note, On the tech-
nical side, he can imitate CSNY,
Hendrix, jazz, blues; nothing — is
beyond his whim, In One Sie Fits
All, he discards the puppets and
bursts in a distinctive style, hope-
fully incomplete, and sure to move
in new and better directions,

Zappa was obtained with the aid of
several noted Zappa freaks.)

a welcome departure from the Pizz-

are tremendously over-rated, Go to

very good, especially when accomp-

variety is the forte of this type of

excellent end to a casual meal. The

list of meats available is extensive,
as is the selection of cheeses, and

it is not “kosher,” but my Man-
