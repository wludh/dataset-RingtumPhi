Powell talk highlights
Founders’ Day, ODK

By PAUL MORELLA

In commemoration of Founders’
Day and in honor of Lee’s birth-
lay, Supreme Court Justice Lewis
FE, Powell, Jr., delivered the tradi-
tional convocation address to the
students and faculty of Wash-
‘ngton and Lee University this
past Monday in Evans Hall.

In his address, Justice Powell
used the Civil War and its after-
‘ath to emphasize the history of
Washington and Lee, as well as
expressing his concern for “a-
nother period of rare problems”
whieh the United States is ex-
periencing today.

The convocation also coincided
with the annual “tapping” cere-
‘nonies for Omicron Delta Kappa,
a national honorary leadership
fraternity first established at
Washington and Lee on Dec. 3,
1914. ODK now has chapters on
over 140 colleges and universities
across the country and is recog-
nized as one of the highest honors
one can receive.

Those who were initiated into
ODK are as follows: Honorary
‘nitiates — Thomas Hal Clarke,
graduate of W&L Law School in

1938, was appointed by President
Nixon to serve as a member of
the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, chairman of the American
Bar Association’s section on
Corporation Banking and Busi-
ness Law; Powell Glass, Jr.,
owner of the Glass Publishing
Company, publisher and general
manager of the Lynchburg News
and Daily Advance; Richard C.
Emrey, alumnus of Lehigh Uni-
versity, executive vice-president
of manufacturing for Lee’s and
Burlington House Carpets, a di-
vision of Burlington Industries,
director of the First National
Exchange Bank of Lexington; and
Lewis A. MeMurran, member of
the W&L class of 1936, member
of the Virginia House of Dele-
gates, chairman of the Bicenten-
nial Commission.

Student initiates are as follows:
Law School — Lawrence Henry
Framme, president, Student Bar
Asociation; John Francis Hanzel,
president of class, managing edi-
tor of Law Review; James M.
Coston, Law Review editor, chair-
man of Orientation Committee;
Rex McNaughton Lamb, chairman

Director Friedkin to open
Contact °74 arts symposium

By ROBERT MORECOCK

Academy Award winning di-
rector William Friedkin will be
escorting the devil to the State
Theatre in Lexington when he
opens Contact ’74 Friday, March
i at & Om.

Utilizing clips from his new
film, “The Exorcist,” Friedkin
will discuss new techniques and
special effects in cinematography
—including such bizarre concerns

as levitation, dual personalities
and demonic possession, areas
whic hare in part responsible

for “The Exorcist” exceeding its
$4.5 million budget by $6 million.

The Contact Committee brings
Friedkin here to visually com-
plement this year’s theme of
twentieth century arts. Friedkin’s
efforts in directing “The French
Connection” won him both an
Oscar and the Directors’ Guild
»* America Award as best director
of the year in 1972.

Friedkin’s film making “form-
ula,” as he calls it, is simple: “I
try to make the best picture ever

made. I go for the most I can
get—all the reviews, all the box
office, all the awards. I don’t
always succeed, but I try.”

Friedkin has added the di-
mensions of sight and sound to
the fiction of William Peter
Blatty, the author of “The
Exorcist.” Blatty is also the film’s
producer. Blatty says the film
goes even further than the book.

Editorials and reviews across
the country are reacting to the
new film. From one Washington,
D.c., reviewer: “As a devout
Christian, I am wondering to
what lengths filmmakers will go
to produce such vile and blashem-
ous trash.” Other comments: “The
power of the movie is overwhelm-
ing,” “The bizarreness and blunt-
ness with which the reality of
evil is depicted is truly stunning,”
“Viewing the film is a traumatic
and potentially vomiting experi-
ence.”

Friedkin aims for audience
participation in his films. “The
Exorcist” is one film where this
goal is attained.

Junior Paul J. Lancaster was
re-elected to the position of editor-

dav night.

Lancaster will serve until the
end of the current school year.
The Publications Board, in an-
nouncing the editorship selection,
said it had decided to move the
election of editor annually to the
spring, as was previously done.

The Board moved the election
date so that the editors and busi-
ness managers of all publications
would be elected at the same
time. Onlv the editorship of the
Phi was contested Tuesday.

Elections for all publications
positions will now be in the
spring.

EC discusses

curriculum

By ROBERT PUGH

The Curriculum Committee is
planning joint  faculty-student
discussions on the curriculum.

Herb Rubenstein, committee
chairman, told the EC that plans
are underway for periodic discus-
sions involving students and de-
partment heads. The students will
be five majors. Rubenstein in-
tends to ask for five minutes of
classtime one day in February
for explanation and completion
of a new curriculum survey. The
Asian Studies meeting has been
rescheduled for Feb. 5.

Gary Avery, Student Recruit-
ment Committee Chairman, said
his committee is attempting to
raise money from foundations,
and plans a fund-raising trip to
New York and Chicago during
the Washington holiday.

Lewis Hannah, Mock Conven-
tion Committee Chairman, said
the committee is organizing plans
for the 1976 convention. Founda-
tions are being asked to donate
funds, and the convention intends
to get recognition as a Bicen-
tennial Celebration. Reed Morgan

The winter break
and the fuel shotage

Next month’s semester break (Feb. 13-17) may not turn out to
xe much of a break for a good number of Washington and Lee
students, simply because of the energy crisis.

As currently scheduled, the break begins Wednesday (presum-
ably after a student’s last class) and ends when classes start bright
and early Monday morning.

That means most students who plan to go home or anywhere
else would come back to Lexington Sunday night.

This is fine for the student living within a gas tank of W&L
and for students who are not planning to travel by car in their
plight from Lexington.

But a large number of students who want to go home live more
than a gas tank away, so to speak. With gasoline unavailable
from late Saturday night until Monday morning, such students would
either have to come back on a Saturday night, heaven forbid, or
not leave this campus at all during that break, heaven even more
forbid.

 

Two solutions seem practical. The first would be to place the
Friday, Feb. 15, classes on Thursday, Feb. 14, and then give students
that Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday off from classes. This
way, the Tuesday-Thursday classes and the Monday-Wednesday-Fri-
day classes would each lose one day of instruction during that break,
as originally planned. And, students would be able to return on a
Monday, with the normal class schedule resuming Tuesday.

Secondly, the university could change the break from Wednesday
evening through Sunday night to Friday evening through Tuesday
night. Again, TT and MWF classes would each lose one period, as
scheduled, on that Monday and Tuesday. And the gas problem is
averted.

The time is now for the appropriate channels of the administra-
tive waterways of this university to deal with this problem. The
University Council, which is normally responsible for the university
calendar, meets next Thursday, and, if needed, the faculty meets the
following Monday.

Certainly a change in scheduling of the break could not affect
classes greatly. It could, however, affect greatly those students who
want a semester break, away from W&L, and who are unable,
because of the gas situation, to get away. And isn’t that what the
purpose of a Winter Term break was in the first place?

Traveller’s advice
questioned

Sir:

This letter is in reference to
last week’s “Ask Traveller” col-
umn. Before I say anything else,
I would like to congratulate the
author of “Traveller” on the Jan.
10 column on co-eds at W&L. I
have less praise concerning last
week’s article.

Though I have great esteem for
anyone who can write so enter-
taining an article as “Ask Travel-
ler,’ I must question his decency
for the unnecessary remarks he
made about the South in his last
article. The column was well-writ-
ten, but it is such a mis-repre-
sentation of the true South that
I must condemn him for it. I
tddress the following remarks to
the author of “Ask Traveller.”

I must warn you that the sub-
ject of the War Between the
States is rather a touchy subject
in Lexington. As a student of
W&L, you are foolish to mention
Gettysburg with General Lee
looking constantly over your
shoulder with the Sword of
Damocles raised in his right hand.

Sir, you have no more of an
idea of the true South as I have
of the People’s Republic of China.
I cannot blame you for this, how-
ever, for I myself might draw
the wrong conclusion given such
a pitiful representation as the
city of Lexington. I suggest you

explore the South a little further
before you declare it “strange”
and “mysterious.”

The gentlemen with the strange

do know many of your so-called
“Odd Fellows” who sport the wide
grins. I can only infer that the
stuff behind their ears, which
you mistook for Spanish moss,
was actually Mexisan grass. This
variety is somewhat more indigin-
ous to the South.

You will kindly restrict your
articles to subjects on which you
have at least a minimum of
knowledge. I remain,

your humble servant,

Dear Anonymous,

We normally do not accept

but in your case we just had
to make an exception.

By the tone of your article,

you seem to imply that the
column on the South was a

misrepresentation and was in-
decent while the article on co-
eds was quite a true representa-
tion and was quite proper. We
wonder if you would have the
same feelings if you were a
co-ed from the North.

The point is, of course, that
“Traveller” merely presents the
views of one individual, male
or female. (We ourselves do
not know who “Traveller” is.
believe it or not.) We certainly
hope that last week’s column
was a mis-representation of the
South, as we hope the article
before that was a_ mis-repre-
sentation of co-eds.

We are certain that the male
northerners who read the col-
umn treated both articles as
mis-representations. Apparently
it all depends on who the sub-
ject of the article is as to
whether the article is decent.

warm look, the kind greeting in

ance to many, are the sustenance

Inside-Out

By ROME SCOTT

  

[ swore I wouldn’t do this but the movie is so good I’ve got to
add my bit to those of the immortals.

“Citizen Kane.”

An incredible, unbelievable, fantastic... (Get the picture?) movie.
It’s certainly the best I’ve ever seen and it may be the best I ever
Will see,

(Now that I’ve gotten all that out of my system—on with the
show.)

“Citizen Kane,” made in 1941 has been lauded by many film
critics for many years as the break-through film.

In the ’30’s and ’40’s films in America were largely formula
films, films that would guarantee a profit to the studio that produced
them,

Orson Welles was invited by RKO to make the film and was
allowed to do it his way. Although it wasn’t a box office success
When first released (one of the reasons Welles didn’t make another
film as excellent as “Kane’”), the movie lives on while many of its
formula brothers of the art have long since been forgotten.

Welles used “Kane” successfully to show that a film can be
interesting as well as artful.

The photography, under the auspices of Gregg Toland, gives the
black and white movie a richness of interpretation and enormous
depth. Camera angles make graphic the contrast between space and
a lack of it.

The story line is interesting almost to a fault and the viewer
loses himself completely to the life of Charles Foster Kane.

The film opens with a newsreel prompted by the death of Kane,
Who had been a powerful newspaper publisher. The newsreel ends
With the last word of Kane, “Rosebud,” and the producer of the
film turns one of his staff loose to find out who “Rosebud” is.

After questioning three of the people closest to Kane, the staffer
still hasn’t learned who “Rosebud” is, but it no longer matters be-
cause he has put together a complete picture of the man.

He finds that Kane was a man who needed to be surrounded by
people who loved him. The catch is—he couldn’t love back.

In the end we find out “Rosebud” is the name of his sled and
realize Kane, who was taken from home when he was young to be
brought up as a rich boy, really was searching for a childhood he
never had.

He was seeking the freedom of a boyhood he knew for a short
tome before he became rich.

(Looking back on what my typewriter has just written, I feel
the plot will probably look trite to the reader who hasn’t seen the
flick. Take my word for it—the movie doesn’t put the plot across
that way.)

Narrative technique, the explicitness of the sound reproduction
(you can hear ac hair squeak) and the acting all add up to make a
movie that will probably be remembered longer than I will be
remembered.

Admittedly this review skims only the surface but if you think
I can cover completely a movie that has been analyzed for 20-years
plus and is still being analyzed... you're wrong (but I appreciate it.),

I am paying for all those who,

SAB applauded

Sir:

I would like to applaud the Stu-
dent Activities Board for a job
well done last Friday in the Na-

Ask Traveller

tional Shakespeare Company’s
presentation of “As You Like It.’”’

The event, probably the SAB’s
greatest success to date, was made
possible by the Culture Commit-
tee of the SAB under junior John
Killpack and the encouragement
of the entire SAB with Mike
srittin as chairman.

The performance was a sweep-
ing success given the limitations
of staging offered by Doremus
Gymnasium. It attracted a large
and enthusiastic crowd, much un-
like past SAB events.

The SAB has a certain re-
sponsibility to the community to
inform them of upcoming activi-
ties as well as have some feeling
for the types of activities stu-
dents, faculty and friends of the
academic community may be in.
terested in.

But students, faculty and friends
of the academic community have
an obligation as well to respond
favorably to SAB activities. SAB
has worked hard this year and.
Vet all it has received in return is
one activity after another going
into the hole.

[ hope that students, faculty
and others will look more care-
fully at the programs of the SAB
with favor rather than with ran-
cor or criticism. The SAB could
be a tool for greater unity among
the university community if given
support and nourished, but as a
leaf in autumn, it can wither
away and die if it no longer
receives support from it life-giv-
ing source, its trunk.

Q—After an old alum assured me there was a house of ill repute here
in his day, I checked the address, only to find a gas station
occupying the spot. Was there ever in fact a pleasure palace in
Lexington and why did the station attendant hand me a road
map of Wisconsin and two dirty air filters?

A—Me thinks the fellow was having a small joke. Filling station
people are a simple, fun-loving folk and are just as liable to
hide a garter snake in your cubbyhole as put air in your tires.

As to your question, such a house did flourish in Lexington
in the early 1900's. A vigorous crack-down in local law enforce-
ment, however, and the madame’s refusal to celebrate Labor
Day on a Monday led to the establishment’s demise in 1924, It
reopened briefly in 1929, catering especially to the academic
community, but students bitterly complained that all the High.
lights in the waiting room were at least two years old. This,
coupled with the proprietor’s claim that the bottom had fallen
out of the market necessitated closure for good; the two-story
house on Main Street was recamped as a Canadian snack bar,
specializing in drab food, while the young ladies of the home
reportedly “got religion” as they crossed the county line and
successfully toured the military installations in Virginia as a
gospel octet.

Gradually, over the years, the demand for a bordello in
Lexington died down, heralding the new era of permissiveness
on our nation’s campuses. Dating was given strong impetus in
the Valley with the discovery of the road trip in 1962 and the
Dutch treat in 1967. Going-for-all-the-marbles replaced Charades
as the favorite college parlor game, and suddenly a girl’s amateur
standing down the road became something actively sought after,
instead of merely respected.

Today, though VMI cadets would give the black piping off
their trousers for it, a return of the shuttered flesh pot to Lex-
ington seems improbable.

Q—But, outside of Lexington, where can I find such an establishment?

A review—

‘The Man of Mode’

By JOHN ELLIS
fhe on-stage skills of Mark
Daughtrey, Don Hogle and Martha
Evans, and the directoral skills
f Lee Kahn highlighted the Uni-

ersity Theatre’s production of
Sir George Etherege’s Restrora-

tion comedy, “The Man of Mode.”
Diminishing the seriousness of
romances of the principal
‘Naracters in the play, Director
Kahn stage mimic throughout,
every secondary character build-
ing the buffoonery until the ulti-
mate buffoon, the crowning exag-
geration, a Restoration clown, Sir
Fopling Flutter (played for all
he’s worth by the devastating
Mark Daughtrey) dazzled _ the
1udience with his betassaled fop-
pery. Indeed, the mimic, led by
Daughtrey, carried the evening
and the audience.

Martha Evans, in the more de-
nure role of Harriet, carried the
lramatic action of the play with
consistant characterization and
conviction. Every motion of her
jan (or whatever) was_ totally
within the character’s mature per-
sonality.

As her mother, Pree Ray suc-
ceeded admirably, making what
could have been a trite, fluffy
role a believable character. Betty
Kahn as the empassioned Mrs.
Loveit brought to the role the
fervor it deserved and avoided
the occasional lapse in characteri-
zation that sometimes beleaguer-
ed the production (though no one
character consistently lapsed, a
few did once or twice).

Happy Pullman as a precocious
maid seemed a little frightened
hy the audience at first, but came
on with her crisp sense of timing
to sharpen into focus the scenes
she appeared in later. The other
women performers were good,
and would deserve more mention
in a longer review.

Barney Skelton, in his first
stage role, brought a glib
mischieviousness to Dorimant
that hurt the play’s effectiveness
(it’s easy to be harsh, but the
manner in which Skelton carried
so heavy a load was hopeful.
Dorimant requires a nasty, but
human figure. Had the role been

more benevolent, Skelton would
have had an easier time.).

Dave DeChristopher as_ the
goatish old Bellair was consistant
and amusing. Hugh Sisson eeked
a charming foppishness, but
brought depth to the potentially
shallow young Bellair. Kit Weit-
nauer succeeded as Mr. Medley,
the sociable gossip about town
and country. Weitnauer played
the part foppishly enough to al-
low Flutter’s exaggeration its
point of mimic, without running
into hyperbole. The minor char-
acters were all fine.

Lee Kahn’s direction was de-
lightful an dimaginative. The en-
tire action was played as a game
and the audience was let in on
it by the mimics as the play ap-
proached climax.

Kahn staged as the play’s cli-
max a scene where the characters
circled one way around the stage
as Flutter and his page circled
the other (the page directed the
conversation). This _ staging
brought home the director’s view-
point without being unduly rude
to the Restoration style. Though
a modern touch, it exemplified
the heart of the play’s message.

O. K. Barnes’ set was notably
furnished (Barens built the furni-
ture). However, the black plastic
background was ineffective ex-
cept to give the white objects on
the set and the colorful costumes
and trappings a dreamv effect,
like soft focus.

Altogether? An admirable pro-
duction, a small step forward for
the University Theatre. Though
haunted by the potential the cast
as a whole didn’t quite reach,
“Man of Mode” displayed the
forward motion of several of
Washington and Lee’s more crea-
tive individuals.

Shakespeare’s ‘As You Like It’

The clanking heaters and lack
of bleacher space for the overflow
crowd were the only disappoint-
ments in Friday night’s perform-
ance of William Shakespeare’s
As You Like It by the National
Shakespeare Company in Doremus
Gymnasium.

The play was performed with
a bawdy exuberance that delight-
ed the audience from beginning
to end. The comic scenes and
lines were overplayed to the hilt
in a style which made for a very
entertaining show.

It was presented in a two-act
format, with the first act taking
place at the court of Duke Frea-
erick and the second act taking
place in the forest of Arden. The
two settings were effectively jux-
taposed, highlighting the decad-
ence of the frivolous court of
Duke Frederick, the usurper,
with the simpler, pastoral and

musical court of Duke Senior, the
banished brother,

Ralph Pochoda, as Duke Frec-
erick, was very convincing as 4
corrupt ruler, making his arbi-
trary banishments of his niece,
Rosalind, and the wrestling vic-
tor, Orlando, quite believable
The contrast between the two
worlds was further illuminated
by the rational characterization
of Duke Senior, played by Kent
tizeley, who accepted the refu-
gees with open arms.

The main thrust of the comic
action was provided by the foo!,
Touchstone, rendered by Marsha):
fosenblum. The part is consid-
ered by many to be the finest
comic role in all of Shakespeare's
plays. He is the central character
of the play, tying together the
various love subplots and playing
devil’s advocate to the melancholy

Worship service opens Black Culture Week

Kiditor’s note: This is the sec-
ond in a series of articles on
the upcoming Black Culture
Week, Feb. 3-8 at Washington
and Lee. The Student Associa-
tion for Black Unity is spon-
soring the week.

By STEVE YEVICH

The opening event of Black
Culture Week will be a worship
service on Feb. 3, at 6 p.m. in
Lee Chapel.

This service, to which the en-
tire student body is invited, will
be a complete Sunday service,
with ushers, programs, sermons,
and an offering. SABU is making
an effort at capturing the es-

Department level student imput desired

By HERB RUBENSTEIN

Members of the Student Cur-
riculum Committee have been
working on the creation of a stu-
dent-faculty forum for the dis-
cussion of new courses, depart-
mental policy, and student sug-
gestions for improvement.

Last semester, the Executive
Committee recommended that the
faculty open its monthly meet-
ings in order for students to
voice their opinions concerning
curriculum changes as well as
faculty policies,

The faculty rejected this pro-
posal, stating that substantive
academic or curriculum policies
were not developed in faculty-
wide meetings, but were develop-
ed at the departmental level by
the chairmen and members of
each department. In rejecting the
proposal for open faculty meet-
ings, the faculty advised the stu-
dents that should they want to
take a more active role in giving
suggestions, this should be done

The Curriculum Committee has
been contacting the chairmen of
the departments this week and
has discussed the feasibility of
such a forum beginning this
semester. The chairmen were re-
ceptive.

This plan would set up informal
meetings each semester between
a few majors in each department

student input.

Any student who wishes to
participate in this new form and
who has declared his major may
volunteer by submitting an ap-
plication in the new Curriculum
Committee “Input” box now in
the Co-op before February. Sopho-
mores are eligible to apply only
if they have decided on their

For a few precious seconds of

utilized his superior weight to
ultimately edge Schwezerhof, 4-2.
The decision gave Western Caro-

On this afternoon of alternat-

W&L wrestlers picked up double

Doug Ford, who quickly pinned
both of his opponents in the 177

Jim Stieff and Jim Crytzer, of the

150 and 142 pound divisions re-
spectively, garnered twin tri-
umphs for the squad.

Sam Lewis (158), Roy Adel-
mann (126), Lee Keck (118) and
Dave Knack (190) contributed
one winning decision apiece. In
particular, sophomore Knack dis-
played real signs of potential,
though wrestling 11 pounds under
the weight limit of his class. His
loss was to WCU’s Mike Ingrao,
a former High School Prep Lea-
gue champion for the state of
Virginia, by 4-3.

majestic B-ball performer. Indeed,
the Lakers ultimately lost

game to the Bucks, 94-90, when
Hawkins missed a pair of lov
percentage jump shots. The ups
and downs are seemingly chara-
cteristic of this 69” forward’
game-style, and of his life.

Certainly, it is strange to see
Hawkins in a Laker uniform,
particularly when he teams with
the likes of Gail Goodrich. His
dislike for the showy guard found
its way into best-selling print
when the troubled Hawk put his
life saga into David Wolf’s Foul.

The two first played together
on the Phoenix Suns, the NBA
team which signed Hawkins when
his long-contested suit against the
league was settled out of court.
During the 1969-70 season, he fin
ally was able to exhibit the skills
which had been bound in ob-
scurity since his innocent mix-up
in the college betting scandals of
1961. Though the fame and riches
found in the big league of the
sport were denied him, Hawkins
nevertheless continued to play his
game. He really had no other
choice, for basketball was all he
knew.

And the talent! It was always
there: on the courts of Harlem’s
school yards, or in the now ex:
tinct ABL, or in the ABA. Even
on the Globetrotters, there spark-
ed that incredible ability which
incited super-clown Meadowlark
Lemon to physically attack Hawk-
ins when he could no _ longer
contro] his envy of the encroach-
ing show-stealer.

Alas, NBA existence held a dis-
turbingly similar pattern for the
Hawk, when he noticed that his
teammate Goodrich was reluctant
to share the ball in tense game
situations. When “Goodie” was
traded to Los Angeles, the Suns’
star-role seemed solidly Hawkins’.
Not for long. Charlie Scott
abandoned the Virginia Squires
for a fat Phoenix contract and
brought to the team a guard-
oriented offense once more.

Just as importantly, the swift
Scott captured the hearts of Sun
patrons, relegating the Hawk to
subordinate status. Last season,
his scoring average plummeted
from 25 points per game to 16,
and the former pride of Arizona

W&L Generals win 3 straight,
face powerful Roanoke Saturday

Plaving before the sparsest
crowds of the season, the baskKet-
ball Generals surged toward the
500 mark with three straight
wins this week.

W&L’s season mark climbed to
5-¢ with wins of 73-57 over Emory
and Henry, 92-80 over arch-rival
Hampden-Sydney, and 114-74 win
over last year’s W&L Invitational
winner, Lebanon Valley. Results
of Wednesday night’s. contest
against Madison were unavailable.

The W&L-Emory and Henry
clash was no artistic success, to
be sure, unless you see art in
the form of whistle-blowing.

The officials called 53 personal
fouls. In addition, E-H coach
Arnold Mellinger was slapped
with a pair of technical fouls.

W&L started slowly—the squad
failed to score until over three
minutes into the game, and the
first tally came as Greg Croghan
sank a free throw after the first
of Mellinger’s technicals. W&L
then trailed, 6-1.

We&L finally gained the lead
midway through the first half,
then turned on the defense to
hold the visitors to six ‘points
in the final eight minutes while
scoring 19 of its own.

Captain Skip Lichtfuss led the
way with 21 points, while Norm
Kristoff and John Rice added 10
and 12, respectively.

Bo Williams did not play be-
cause of the flu.

Those who came to the Thurs-
day game with Hampden-Sydney
saw the Generals that were
promised to the fans at the sea-
son’s outset—running, aggressive,
high-scoring.

They saw Skip Lichtfuss reach
another milestone.

And they saw another
fell Norm Kristoff.

The 6’8” center came up limp-
ing after a first half chase for a
loose ball. The injury has been
diagnosed by trainers as a pos-
sible “stress fracture’ which
could keep Kristoff out of cation
for as long as three weeks.

He might, however, be ready in
time for Saturday’s contest here
against Roanoke. Then again, he
might not.

As for the game against H-S,
the first half belonged to Kristoff,
Lichtfuss and John Podgajny.

Kristoff collected 12 points and
eight rebounds in his first half
appearance.

Podgajny sank six of seven
field goal tries for another dozen
points.

And Lichtfuss rarely missed as
he scored 20 points in the first
half. His final bucket of the half
gave him a career total of 1290
at W&L, moving him ahead of
Mike Neer into sixth place on the
all-time W&L scoring list.

Those three combnied for 44
of the Generals’ 48 first half
points, and W&L led, 48-33.

But W&L lost the big man ad-
vantage over H-S early in the
second half, as Kristoff’s replace-
ment, Randy Taylor, fouled out
with four minutes gone into the
final period. The Tigers chopped
away at the 20-point W&L lead,
and with 5:20 left, trailed by only
eight points,

Enter Jerry Porath, and the
senior guard engineered three

six with four of his own, and
the Generals clinched the win.

And, last Saturday, Lebanon

from one year ago when they

the loss of three starters from
that team plus the loss this vear

challenge which the role _ pre-
sented with a great deal of

vitality and energy.

His obvious knowledge of the
stage and the character enabled
his to do justice to the essential
role of Touchstone.

Similarly, the parts of Rosalind,
plaved by Sharon Swink, and
Celia, played by Anni Long, were
portrayed with great insight and
an equal understanding of what
pleases an audience.

There were only two parially
unsatisfying characterizations in
the play: Jaques, played by Ralph
Pochoda, and Orlando, played by
James Klawin.

Jaques, the melancholy lord
serving Duke Senior, seemed too
light-hearted in the cozy forest—

Orlando, the romantic suitor to
Rosalind, came across as an ab-
surd puppy dog at some points
in his affair with Rosalind. How-
ever, these faults were more than
mitigated by the actors’ remark
able ability to entertain the audi-
ence throughout.

Apart from the play, equally
impressive was the portable set
which the company carried with
it. Though not elaborate, it pro-
vided scenery designer, Jeremy
Unger, an effective and workabie

Hollins dance group, ‘Members of Orchesis,’
to perform at W&L as part of current tour

Members of Orchesis, the Hol-
lins College student dance group,
will perform at Washington and
Lee on Friday, January 25 at 8:30
as the fifth stop in a month-long
tour.

Comprising the tour group are
nine members of the regular
Orchesis troupe, a special student,
and lecturer in dance, Haruki
Fujimoto. The tour is a January
short term project for which the
students will receive academic
credit.

Dances in the program have
been choreographed by Fujimoto
and Paula Levine, associate pro-
fessor of dance, and by students.

Highlighting the program will
be the performance of a 1965 rep-
ertory number by Miss Levine,
“Dot and Line.” In this modern
dance, Fujimoto and_ students
portray “a dot, a line and a
squiggle.” Miss Levine’s “Techni-
que Study,” a demonstration
of Graham dance technique, will
be presented by nine students.

“Vinetas,” eight modern dance
vignettes, choreographed by Fuji-
moto, will be performed by the
choreographer and ten students.

Ginger Nicrosi will perform in
her own composition—and dance
in ballet style—to selections from
Prokofiev’s “Classical Symphony.”

Committees address EC

(Continued from page 1)
said several speakers are being
considered for this May. Both
students are unsure whether a
special student tax will be needed
in 1975-76 to fund the conven-
tion.

Sophomore EC rep Leland Mc-
Cullough said the faculty is very
concerned about missing books in
the library. Ways to alleviate the
problem were discussed and ac-
tion was deferred.

DANCE
There will be a dance in the
Cockpit on Friday, January 25.
Admission will be free and the
featured band will be “Voyce.”

Other student performers are

Orchesis president Susan Fox,
Kay Russell, Eleanor Denegre,
Renee Perez, special student
David Schultz, Lynne Adams,
Lynn Frielinghaus, Luceanna
Overall and Beth Sencindiver.
The regular Orchesis troupe

comprises 15 to 20 students wh»
are admitted by audition. Mem-
bership offers experience in cho-
reography and preformance. The
group presents two programs and

Connie Hawkins—NBA

was ripe trade bait, just another
high-priced player to peddle away.

Early this season, Hawkins
found a new home in Los Angeles.
The Lakers hoped that he would
replace Jim MceMillian, the cun-
ning butterball sent to Buffalo
for Elmore Smith. In this task,
Hawkins has enjoyed only partial
success. His point production has
further slackened, as (again)
Goodrich keys offensive strata:
gem. Yet he plays on a division.
leading club for the first time in
his NBA career, as the Lakers
presently hold a three game bulge
over runner-up Golden State,

At 31, the Hawk may already
be entering the twilight of a ca-
reer diminished by the onus of
clandestine black-listing policies.
Surely, he will never attain the
heights of basketball greatness
that observers of his single year
of play at Iowa designated his
just due.

In a time when comparatively
mearge talents are wooed and
won by fast-spending franchises
Hawkins is an apt reminder of
another, grimmer side to profes-
sional sport. For the fortunate
few, pro basketball can be a king-
maker, the perpetrator of a coin-
hungry American dream. Hawkins
experienced the seamy, hypocriti-
cal side of that dream for nearly
a decade. The nightmare, its stifl-
ing effect upon a potential never
fullfilled, will linger alwavs.
