Campus to be designated
As national historical site

Ceremonies to mark the desig-
nation of Washington and Lee’s
tront Campus as a National His-
toric Landmark are scheduled for
Friday, Oct. 12. Governor 1An-
wood Holton, a 1944 graduate, will
sneak at the 4:30 p.m. program to

held on the Front Lawn .

A panel discussion will be held
at 2 p.m. in Lee Chapel concern-
ing Wé&L’s architecture, past,
present, and future. Members of
the panel will be I. Taylor San-
iers, University historian, and
Everett Fauber, Sr., the Univer-
siiv’s restoration architect. Frede-
ric Cox of Marcellus Wright, Cox,
and Cilimberg of Richmond, archi-
tects for the University’s new
puilding program, will be there

the second for Washington
and Lee, Lee Chapel was named a
National Landmark in 1962.

The center building of the Col-
onnade was erected in 1824. The
Center Building, Washington Hall,
Was designed and built by
Colonel John Jordan of Lexing-
ton, who had served as a builder
and architect at Monticello and
the University of Virginia.

Upon the completion of the ele-
gant new building the students
climaxed the festivities by liter-
lly tearing down Graham and
Union Halls, built only twenty
years before. The cornerstone-
laying was also accompanied by
a Whiskey party which saw a
“thirsty multitude break through
all restraint” and “men rolling on
the ground like swine.” The con-
temporary author of this discrip-
tion was probably unaware of the
significance of this early form of
gatoring,

The Centre Building had 10
classrooms on the first floor, six
classrooms, a stage and a chapel
(used as the president’s office)
on the second floor, and rooms for
literary societies on the third
floor. This building will be 150
years old in 1974,

Once the Centre Building was
completed plans were begun for
the Lyceum. Now called Payne
Hall, it was intended to house the
library, the physical museum, and
the Departments of Chemistry
and Physics. The President’s of-
fice was on the second floor and
was where Robert E. Lee became
President of Washington College
on October 4, 1865,

In the early 1840’s a dormitory

was added on the east side of the
Centre Building to restore sym-
metry to the campus. However,
the new dormitory was to have
one door instead of two and thus
add an element of variety. The
building was named _ Robinson
Hall in 1844 for “Jockey” John
Robinson, one of the school’s
faithful ante bellum patrons.
The carved wooden statue of
George Washington atop Wash-
ington Hall was the creation of
the local cabinet maker, Captain
Mathew S. Kahle. Legend has it
Kahle retrieved a giant log from
the James River and proceeded to
practice his hobby on it. He was
paid less than $100 for this tem-
porary statue; the trustees in-
tended to replace it with one of
marble when it could be afforded.

Faculty votes down motion
To restructure committee

 

The faculty Monday voted
down a proposal which would
have increased student member-
ship in the Courses and Degrees
Committee from one to four,

The proposal presented to the
faculty, rejected 46-40, was a
“watered-down” version of a pro-
posal originally calling for equal
representation on the committee
of six students and six faculty
members.

The original proposal, backed
by the student Executive Com-
mittee, was revised by the fac-
ulty-student University Council
last Thursday.

The proposal to place four stu-
dents on the committee along
with eight faculty members would
have made the committee more
responsive to the students in re-
gards to curriculum matters, ac-
cording to proponents of the pro-
posal. In addition, the proposal, if
approved, would have made the
Courses and Degrees Committee
more of a buffer zone between
the student Curriculum Commit-
tee, which initiates many student
proposals for curriculum changes,
and the faculty, which have final
say in all curricular matters.

Although the faculty meeting
was closed to the public, indica-
tions were that the faculty re-
jected the proposal in lieu of any
sort of substantial argument back-
ing the proposal.

Specifically, an increase of four

1840’s also added four residentia!
houses to the campus, one to
house the President and three for
professors. When General Lee
consented to become the President
of Washington College, the trus-
tees determined that a more ele-
gant and spacious residence was
required for the South’s hero.

The result was the present
President’s residence of which
Lee disapproved for its extrava-
gance. The cost of the project was
more than $15,000.

Student guides will be present
October 12 to conduct tours of
the Washington group, those
buildings erected between 1824
and 1842, the ante bellum faculty
homes and the President’s Home.
A reception will be held on the

Front Lawn following the dedica- §

tion ceremony.

students to the committee was
proposed in order to gather stu-
dent representation on the com-
mittee from all general fields of
study in the college, essentially
those fields delineated by the
four “distribution groups.”

OUTLOOK and REVIEW

A case of executive fiat

The Executive Committee has met for three consecutive Mon-
days since the Fall Term began last month. In each of those meetings,
the committee called for an executive session, a session closed to all
student body members except those on the EC itself.

There is nothing in the student body constitution pertaining to
these executive sessions, which means such a session could be called
at the whim of the EC.

   

The effect, then, is that the EC can discuss any matters it wants
to discuss in closed session—matters, perhaps, which should be closed,
as in the cases of Honor System violations, but also matters which
quite feasibly could be of general student concern which the EC does
not want to discuss in the open, perhaps in order to avoid possible
strong student action and reaction to the topic involved.

What these matters are we cannot say for certain, since we have
been barred from such hearings. But it is doubtful that the EC has met
for three weeks in closed session to discuss individual cases not of
general concern to the student body.

The General Assembly of the State of Virginia has passed a law

which affects organizations in the public domain which parallel the
EC. The law states that all meetings of organizations concerned with
the disbursement of public funds are to be open to the public. There
are some exceptions where discussion would not be concerned with
the general public interest. Only in those exceptional cases can a
closed session of, say, a state legislature be called. Otherwise, the or-
ganizations are accountable to the public, and the meetings must be
open to the public.

As the Va. General Assembly law is concerned with organizations
charged with the disbursement of public funds, we are here concerned
with an organization charged with the disbursement of student funds.
If a parallel is to be drawn, the EC meetings should be open to the
student body, except in certain instances defined by law.

One notable exception would be, as stated earlier, meetings con-
cerned with individual students in, say, alleged honor violations. Other
exceptions along this line would also call for closed sessions. Other-
wise it is the obligation of the EC to remain in open session for all
matters expressly concerned with the student body in general or with
the disbursement of the student body’s fund. We note that even Lex-
ington has complied in most instances on this latter point, opening
its ‘work sessions” on its budget last May to the public, even though
the meetings were informal and not really required by law to be open.

What’s more, the EC has been asking the Ring-tum Phi in past
weeks to publish a letter which in summary states that the EC is the
student body’s governing organization and that all students are wel-
come to attend all EC meetings and discuss all student body matters
with the EC. That letter and the weekly habit of the EC to call execu-
tive session do not seem to exprss parallel philosophy as to the goals
of the EC. One says the EC is open to all students for all student body
matters at all times; the other seems to negate this.

Further, the EC last year called for a “recommendation” of sorts
stating that faculty meetings, which have not in recent times been
open to students or to anyone else for that matter, should be opened at
least partially to students. This way, those paying money to attend
this institution would know what’s going on in the “proving grounds”
for many recommendations (see page 1 for the final discision on the
Courses and Degrees Committee proposal, for example) affecting the
populace of Washington and Lee. Of course, those meetings are still
closed, but that is not the point.

Even though it was last year’s EC which made that recommenda-
tion, we sense the same feeling of condemnation of the faculty for
its closed sessions by this year’s EC. But how can a body condemn
another for holding closed sessions while that first body maintains
the power to close its sessions at its whim? This is hypocrisy.

Several amendments to the student body constitution are coming
up for ratification by the student body shortly concerned with various
aspects of student life, none of which directly affects the EC. An ad-
ditional amendment limiting the potential dictatorial powers of the
EC to hide from the student anyhing it wants would be in order.

Last year, one candidate for an Executive Committee office called
for an end to “executive fiat” on the part of the EC. The arbitrary
determination of what is open to the student body and what is not
is one such example of that fiat.

The Abortion Dilemma
Sir:

America’s number one problem
is not Watergate or Agnew or the
Brezhnev Doctrine. The most
serious problem for America is
the prophylactic mindset which
permeates our culture. America
has an anti-Life culture. Since
God is the Author of Life, Ameri-
can culture is in the very core
of its existence anti-God.

Since this is so there is very
small chance of authentic Human
Life Amendment clearing Con-
gress. Nonetheless, we must per-
sist in our struggle to rescue the
unborn. For every nation which
has had a systematic cult of in-
fanticide has been punished by
God.

Why is this? Because in the

tic mindset within a culture there

By Johnny E. Morrison

One of the most depressing dis-
crepancies which exists in the his-
torical analysis of both America
and the world is the gap between
Black History and how it is re-
corded in the history books.

I happen to be one of the for-
tunate ones who thought sacri-
ticing an hour from the everyday
routine to view “Black History:
Lost, Stolen or Strayed” was wor-
thy. This film not only revealed
the many contributions made by
Blacks in the fields of science and
arts but also caused the viewer to
ask himself some perplexing ques-
tions. Questions such as “Why
didn’t Picasso attribute many of
the ideas for his painting to Afri-
can sculpture?” and “Why did
not the true inventors in the field
of technology get recognition?”
cause one to be appalled at the
way the world has systematically
excluded Blacks from history.

Black history, viewed from the
outside, usually depicts the Black
mass as one offering little to the
world, society and themselves.

is established the ultimate revolt
against God. In rejecting Life,
man actually rejects God. A na-
tion which establishes this rejec-
tion in law invites the most ter-
rible punishment.

When man takes the prophylac-
tic mindset for his own, he in ef-
fect opts to construct a brave new
world in his own image. Such 4
world in which man answers to
no authority higher than himself
must of its very nature be totali-
tarian.

Every year Americans dump
thousands of pounds of dead
babies into hospital incinerators.
The blood of these murdered in-
nocents cries out to Heaven for
vengeance. Rescue a baby.

Class of ’74

at soul

Blacks are perceived to be the
master race in three categories:
ignorance, laziness and content-
ment under any circumstances.
However grim and despvcndent
this picture looks when one peers
from the outside, the beauty of
Black History still shines in the
minds, body and souls of Black
people. Not only have they, as a
race, been able to conquer and
heal the psychological damage
caused by the inconsistencies of
a sometimes free and God-fearing
nation but they have surpassed
the limits of human endurance
under unbearable situations and
conditions.

No longer can the historians
afford to neglect the roles Blacks
have played in making this a bet-
ter world. Nor can they afford to
negiect the roads Blacks paved in
Gpening the doors to medicine
and the arts. The essense of a real
historian is being able to record
the truth and not what people
want him to record. This is what
niust be done if Blacks are to be-
lieve that the history books really
‘tell it like it is.”

By Rome Scott

Hats off to the Interfraternity
Council for bringing the Zoll-
man’s Follies—a five hour mont-
age of music from six groups—
Sunday afternoon. A big mouth-
ful of music to chew at one time,
the show was, never-the-less, han-
died well.

All of the groups were booked
by United Entertainment out of
Richmond, a fact which was an-
nounced every 15 minutes, and
none performed below a fairly
high standard of proficiency—
though one was noticibly worse
than others.

Of the six, three groups could
have been warm up groups to
some of the top acts in the Unit-
ed States—Sand Castle, Daddy
Rabbit, and Bad Dog put on per-
formances that measure high on
the professionalism scale.

Sand Castle, a six-man group,
displayed a depth of musicianship
seldom seen in a reproduction

band. Horn’ players’. played
guitar with an _ equal and
large amount of talent, guitar

players showed amazing ability
on horns and everyone in the
group sang—well.

A clean, strong, well-balanced
sound formed numbers such as J.
Geils’ “Southside Shuffle,” the
Doobie Brothers’ “China Grove,”
Derek and the Dominos’ “Layla”
and the Allman Brothers’ “Ram-
blin Man.”

The band didn’t let down the
soul people either. “I’ll Be There,”
“Respect” and “Papa was a Rollin’
Stone” were laid down with the
precision, power and controlled
drive that made the originals
famous.

Unlike so many other jukebox
groups, Sand Castle played every
song with the style of the original
without losing the life of the
music,

Originality was not the order
of the day and only Daddy Rabbit
gave the crowd something new.
“Sailor,” a song showing the in-
fluence of Yes and the Strawbs
but still definitely the group’s,
was a bright spot in the over-

cast, rainy afternoon.

Bad Dog came in third riding
on hard hits with a heavy, defini-
tive beat and a volume control
that gave all the instruments an
equal chance.

Greater Experience and Now
and Then filled in the gaps be-
tween the other acts with a va-
riety of soul and funky rock that
was at least adequate.

Only the last group fell short of
the mark upheld by the other
bands. Shreiking whistles and
poor music made the Grandeurs
and Montereys a pain to listen to.

The IFC’s show at Zollman’s
Pavilion was a dramatic step in
the right direction. Let’s hope it
isn’t the last.

WGL Theatre
Features ‘Royal
Hunt of the Sun’

The Troubadour Theatre’s first
presentation of the year will be
The Royal Hunt of the Sun by
Peter Shaffer. The 1964 London
play is being brought to Lexing-
ton by the student director Doug
Thomas. Direction of the play
will serve Thomas as a senior
thesis in drama to complete his
major.

Thomas has participated active-
ly in Washington and Lee’s drama
program, having appeared in
eight plays in his college career.
In fact, he has already directed
one play, Harold Pinter’s Old
Times. Thomas is a senior major-
ing in drama and English.

The basic element of the play
which will be highlighted are its
spectacle, movement, sound
and rhythm. The main problem
encountered thus far has been the
limitations of the Troubadour
Theatre stage. The all male cast
of 27 will crowd the stage and
will have to be handeled with
care.

The music for the production is
in the process of being composed
by students Richard Wright and
Doug Harwood. The technical di-
rector and set designer for Royal
Hunt is Ken Barnes. The set will
feature platforms and steps allow-
ing various entrances and exits
for the large cast.

Shaffer’s play concerns Pizar-
ro’s conquest of the Aztecs in
1533. The intent of the drama is
to contrast Inca faith and Euro-
pean faithlessness, European
hope and Indian hopelessness.
The Spaniards take the wealth of
the Indians and offer them civili-

().—Drinking is a popular pastime at W&L. I’ve had all the usual con-
coctions; do you have some out-of-this-way recipes of your own
that the casual tourist can’t sample on the open pavillion?

A.—You bet I do! And if the casual tourist ever got ahold of them, all
the streets in town would have to be made two-way again to
handle the overflow crowds!

Remember, every cocktail has an intended purpose, a prede-
termined reaction mixed right into it. For instance, grain alcohol
sweetened with fruit punch, as any experienced Lothario can
tell you, produces a mild state of euphoria in girls, such that any
chick under three hundred pounds is off her feet for good. (The
antidote, by the way, is a glass of milk laced liberally with a
can of STP motor oil; get THAT down a wilting Sem-flower and
you'll have a raging funny car on your hands, saving you that
annoying trip back to B.V.)

Here are two of my favorites:

For an A Plus in any drama course, just down the liquor in
one gulp, place the pumpkin on your head and, oola-la, you'll be

WA&L students prepare for the one giant leap in the civilian para-

Jump Club off the ground

—Photo by Bill Robinson

Reaching the heights

By Tom Rittenberg

Over this past weekend thirteen
members of the W&L community
experienced that peculiar falling
sensation that many pizza affici-
anados often dream about. But in
this case the hardy pioneers of
the W&L Jump Club put only the
grace of God and a silk parachute
between life and the otherwise in-
evitable grease splotch on the
ground. Here there was no chance
to wake up before hitting bottom.

These daring adventurers met
last week to form the Jump Club
at the instigation of Captain Ro-
bert Busch of the W&L Army

ROTC detachment. Busch, an ex-
pert parachutist (you may have
seen him in a Colt 45 commercial
a few years back), said that the
club was a civilian organization
open to all. The ROTC unit is act-
ing only as a go-between for the
club. Lieutenant-Colonel Louis
McFadden, the detachment com-
mander, felt that the club fulfill-
ed two goals. First it makes the
ROTC program more diversified,
interesting and dynamic; and sec-
ondly, provides all students with
an opportunity to jump.

The club was trained at the

PROUD FLESH by

William Humphrey (Knopf, $6.95)

In a time when novels about
families and family trees are en-
joving an enormous rebirth,
“Proud Flesh” stands above most.

This book is constructed of
fresh images seated in a new per-

spective and creates a lasting im-
pact.

The Renshaws are typical of a
arge number of Southern families
in many ways—proud, close-knit
and arrogant. The one difference
is the intensity of the sons’ and
daughters’ love for their mother.
That love is the binding power of
the family while Edwina Ren-
shaw is alive and its downfall
when she dies.

Nor is he a star.

See, Mr. Smith, your article

the freshman tight end as an “un-

I know. I asked him .

True, Mr. Smith, Tony would

As for his “problems at Waynes-
boro High,” where he supposedly
“got very little fundamental in-
struction,” you’re right. He never
learned how to play tight end
there, because he never played
tight end there.

“T played split end and middle
linebacker in high school, posi-
tions which required little block-
ing instruction,” Tony replied
when asked about this. He con-
tinued, “I had good coaches in
high school, and they taught me a
lot about playing split end and
middle linebacker—in other
words, how to run patterns, catch
the ball, and stick people.”

As for the headline, Mr. Smith,
which in case you forgot read
“Generals’ Perry is Unhappy
Star,” Tony said:

“Number one, I’m not unhappy
at all to be playing for W&L.
Number two, I don’t see how any-
one could be called a star after

W&L water polo team prepares for state tourney

By John Killpack

The largest Washington and
Lee Water Polo Club ever has be-
gun practice for their fall season.

The large turnout for the club
this year is the cause of a good
deal of optimism concerning the
coming year, according to Coach
Bill Stearns.

Coach Stearns feels that the
club has its best chance ever of
taking the state water polo title
this month in Richmond. The
Generals have been srong run-
ners-up to University of Virginia
in the past two state tournaments,
and Stearns sees the teams from
Virginia and University of Rich-
mond as Washington and Lee’s
strongest threats in this year’s
contest.

This season’s club is paced by
junior captain Dick Barber of

Miami, sophomore goalie Bill
Tiers, and returning starters Will
Brotherton, Jim Howard, and

Gary Seldomridge. A strong group

Stingy Generals blank Centre, 22-0

By Bill Flesher

Fumbles, sophomores, and de-
fense were the stories at Wilson
Field last Saturday, as Washing-
ton and Lee’s football Generals
upped their record to 2-0 by
whitewashing Centre College, 22-0.

W&L’s defense held the Colo-
nels to 165 total yards, while fore-
ing five turnovers, four of them
fumbles. Three of the fumbles
led to 15 of the Generals’ points.

The offense was led by sopho-
mores Jack Berry and Rob Lind-
sey. Berry, starting in the place
of regular quarterback Lewis
Powell, who was held out due to
a sore shoulder, went 10-6 in the
air for 102 yards. One pass was a
19-yard touchdown strike to fresh-
man Jay Monahan.

Lindsey, a starting defenseman
on the General’s lacrosse team,
became the first W&L back to
gain 100 yards this year. His five-
yard touchdown run in the fourth
quarter gave him 102 yards in 23
carries for the day.

We&L got on the board early in
the second period. After Mike
Brittin recovered quarterback
Roy Beard’s fumble at the Centre
22, the Generals took seven plays
to score, with Jim Farrar going
the final yard on a fourth-and-
goal. A fake extra-point attempt
failed, making it 6-0.

Later in the quarter, Walter
Cox picked up a loose ball on the
Centre 22. The offense got down
to the 4, but the drive stalled
there. Coach Bill McHenry called
on Ralph Moore to try a 21-yard
field goal, and the freshman suc-

ceeded, giving W&L a 9-0 halftime
lead.

W&L then put together their
only long scoring drive of the
day, 71 yards in eleven plays.
Berry went 4-4 on the drive, hit-
ting passes of 8, 13, 9 and 19
yards. The last one was the touch-
down strike to Monahan which,
with Moore’s conversion, made it
16-0 at the end of three quarters.

W&L’s final touchdown came
after another fumble recovery.
Freshman linebacker Steve White
fell on this one at the 26. Seven
plays later, Lindsey went in from
the five, putting him over the
century figure for the afternoon.
The PAT attempt was blocked,
bu by this time the only thing
left was for the defense to pre-
serve the shutout.

The win meant an end to Cen-
tre’s domination over Washing-
ton and Lee the last six years.

A look at some

Trials of Rush

[he situation for the average
freshman is a unique one indeed
Thrust into a new environment
with strangers all around him he
is put through what would have
to be the most hectic week of his
life,

Given just enough time to un
pack his clothes he is then hustl-
ed off to a motel where he is
filled with bad food and endless
speeches. Then, to top it all off,
he is told to sleep with some
guy he’s never even seen before
Now it wouldn’t be so bad if this
was where all the running around
stopped, for as unpleasant as it
is orientation is an important
program, but this is only the be-
ginning. The real hastle comes
when the freshman is finally buss-
ed back to his dorm. At this point
fraternity Rush takes over where
orientation left off. Heaven forbid
the freshman be allowed
time to think and get adjusted to
his new home away from home.

After paying the “small” sum
of $13.50 our tireless wanderer is
whisked off on, what seems like,
an endless string of open houses
For those who haven’t had the
pleasure of partaking in one of
these festive events, let me supply
you with the details. First of all,
in order to locate the person who
will take you to your first open
house, you must force your way
through the most incredible mass
of humanity this side of a riot
Once recognized you are handed
a card bearing your name. Pin
ning this across your chest you
are then marched off to the first
house on your schedule. Having
reached your destination
spend the ensuing thirty minutes
drinking coca-colas, shaking
hands, and telling 92 people how
much you love the school you
have hardly even seen yet, Finally
when the half hour is up the indi-
vidual is hustled back to his
dorm and the process is repeated

[ am just trying to point out
how hectic and absurd it can be-
come. And then possibly stimulate
someone enough to find answe!
to help the plight of the fresh-
man.
