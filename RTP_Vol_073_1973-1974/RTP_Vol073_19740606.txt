394 receive de

On Thursday, May 30, a total
of 394 students received their de-
grees as commencement exercises
were held in Doremus Gymna-
sium owing to bad weather.
Commencement ceremonies are
traditionally held on W&L’s his-
toric front campus.

Among the degrees confered
by President Robert E. R. Hunt-
ley were:

—189 B.A. degrees to under-
graduate seniors in the arts and
sciences division;

—49 B.S. degrees to seniors in
the College;

—48 B.A. degrees to students
in the School of Commerce, Eco-
nomics and Politics;

—28 B.S. degrees to students
of that division;

—80 Juris Doctor degrees to
students of the School of Law.

Two students of the undergrad-
uate school received two di-
plomas each. They are Richard
L. Orr, Jr. of Winston-Salem, N.C.,
and Philip B. Willis of Hunts-
ville, Ala. Both successfully met
the degree requirements for B.A.
and B.S. simultaneously.

The President also awarded
four honorary diplomas, three of
them to former W&L graduates.
Among those honored were
Justice Alexander M. Harman,
Jr., of Virginia’s Supreme Court,
James G. Leyburn, former pro-
fessor and dean emeritus of
W&L, Robert Owen Paxton, a
Lexington native and European
history professor at Columbia
and Thomas Wolfe, author of
“Radical Chic,” “Electric Kool-
Aid Acid Test” and other books.

 

Dr. Louis W. Hodges, professor of religion, delivers the baccalaureate sermon of May 29.

Harman, Wolfe and Paxton are
graduates of Washington and Lee.

Commencement exercises be-
gan on Wednesday with a bacca-
laureate sermon for graduating
seniors and their families. Dr.
Louis W. Hodges of the religion
department gave the address on
“Community: The Fragile
Dream.”

That night the traditional Presi-
dent’s Reception was held for
the seniors and their families at
the President’s Home where Gen-
eral Robert E. Lee spent the last
year’s of his life.

Freshmen aim for srad schools

Almost 3 per cent of the past
year’s freshman class plan to
become lawyers, with more than
18 per cent planning to enter
business, according to a recently
released report of a survey taken
last fall by the American Coun-
cil on Education.

The medical professions ran a
close third at W&L last fall, with
about 15 per cent indicating that
they plan a career in the medical
field.

More than three times as many
entering freshmen plan a legal
career here as the national aver-
age—29.9 per cent, as against 7.9
per cent among male freshmen
throughout the country. The
number of those who plan to
enter business, 18.2 per cent, is
only slightly above the national
men’s average of 17.8 per cent.
On the other hand the per cent-

age of W&L freshmen who plan
medical careers, 15.1 per cent, is
much higher than the national
average for men, 9.4 per cent.

After medicine, the fourth most
frequently named career choice
here was research science, with
4.1 per cent of the freshman class
indicating an intention to enter
this field which ran slightly be-
low the national average.

The ACE survey results show-
ed that Washington and Lee
draws its student body from a
wider geographical area than the
“average” four-year college. Of
V&L freshmen, 89.2 per cent
live more than 500 miles from
Lexington. The average in the
nation who went more than 100

miles was 49.4 per cent, and the
average who went more than 500
miles was 14.9 per cent.

Streakers revive tradition

By J. L. REEVES

Streaking may have been the
fad on college campuses this year
but at Washington and Lee it
yyas only a revival from the early
nineteenth century history of the
school,

The first streak of this year in
early March was held at mid-
night on the Colonnade. Only
those interested in the event were
in attendance. However the first
recorded streaking in the area
came somewhate less discreetly
at 7:30 a.m.

In 1804 an incidnet of a stu-
dent baring himself and running
around in public in this less than
modest state was recorded by the
Wé&L Board of Trustees. The
student, William Crump, was
charged with “running naked
through the streets” of the preci-
ously peaceful hamlet of Lexing-
ton in the early hours of the
morning.

Crump apparently admitted the
charge and received a_ punish-
ment for which today’s streakers
would be grateful: simply a
reprimand,

Today the streaker is unfor-
tunately not looked upon as the
party responsible for the restora-
tion of a tradition so long buried
in time. The school still only
reprimands those who are guilty
of such action, if they bother to
approach the subject at all. The
local authorities are not quite
so benevolent in their attitude

toward the phenomenon.

Two students have been ar-
rested for streaking this year,
one having been picked up twice.
The student who was caught in
the act on only one occasion
forfeited his bond, The other stu-
dent was charged with indecent
exposure both times and receiv-
ed progressive fines, the last
amounting to $150.

Most people on campus have
taken the revival of this tradi-
tion in good humor. The attitude
— the local authorities has un-
fortunately been somewhat dif-
ferent. One of those who has
viewed streaking critically has
been the President of the Uni-
versity, Robert E. R. Huntley. He
feels that streaking should be dis-
couraged on the grounds that it
imposes an unwanted spectacle
on some people and offends their
sense of propriety.

Although running nude through
the streets is considered a morals
charge in Lexington it does not
seem to have damaged the careers
of past offenders. William Crump,
the first streaker, did not go
straight to hell for his conduct,
but first became a U.S. Congress-
man and later Ambassador to
Chile. Perhaps the streakers of
this day and age are being pre-
pared for equally illustrious
careers and who is to say whether
it was this past immodesty that
fitted the original streaker to
serve as a U.S. ambassador?

OUTLOOK and REVIEW]
Enjoying Washington and Lee

Most freshmen entering college have some apprehensions about
the experience of which they are about to partake. These considera-
tions may not keep them awake at night but they are nonetheless
real. Most will wonder about this new life style and about the quality
of life at Washington and Lee.

These misgivings are indeed well founded; adapting to college life
is not easy. W&L will expect a great deal from you, as it does from
each member of the student body. The school will challenge you in
every sense, especially academically and socially. Washington and Lee
is here not only to serve but to be served by those who matriculate.

The success of your first year here is largely dependent on you.
The school provides only the environment and opportunity for intel-
lectual and personal growth. It is left to the individual to meet the
challenge which awaits him. One can only gain by responding to
the opportunity provided by this institution. Freshmen learn that
the old maxim still rings true: you have to put something into it
before you can get anything out of it.

W&L will require your best. This is something we hope you will
assume rather than having to learn from your own experience.
Through dedication to the betterment of both yourself and the school
your stay here will be all it can and should be.

The only advice that we can offer which will specifically serve
you in your first year here is that you should keep an open mind
to all the new experiences and alternatives with which you will soon
be faced. Do not allow yourself to close the door to different facets
of life at W&L before you have learned to appreciate that which

they have to offer.

While going through freshman orientation make a point of listen-
ing to all those who would advise you. Everybody is willing to give
advice to freshmen. Each person’s point of view will prove helpful
if you can possibly absorb it all. As people tell you about the Honor
System or their concept of the school, listen carefully and learn
from them before you have to learn it on your own.

One important aspect of life at W&L is the fraternity system.
Fraternities were weakened in the sixties, put have made a strong
comeback and are prospering. Today, well over half of the students
are affiliated with Greek houses. Many people fee] that their fra-
ternity membership has played an important role in their college!
career. Whatever one’s prejudices may be, one should go through
Rush and attempt to gain an understanding of the system here be-

fore making a commitment.

Come to W&L with an open mind and make a point of listening
to other people when you get here. If you do this you will be able
to enjoy a successful and rewarding first year in college. This school
has so much to offer that your stay at W&L will prove a happy

one if you only let it.
We look forward to seeing you this fall and sincerely hope that

both you and Washington and Lee profit by your coming. Good luck!
—J.L.R.

Ask Traveller

Ed, note—‘Ask Traveller” has appeared as a weekly column in
the paper this year. The name of the series refers to the horse
of Robert E. Lee who is buried behind Lee Chapel.

—Reply to a prospective freshman—

Q—What does Washington and Lee have to offer?

A—A good night’s sleep, for one thing. You see, at the time I
graduated from high school, I suffered from insomnia. Since the
lowing of cattle was the only thing able to put me to sleep, I
chose to work on my uncle’s dairy farm instead of going to
college. It wasn’t a bad life, really. And in my spare time I
coached a promising young Guernsey to moo “Away in the
Manger” under my window at night. Unfortunately, the comedy
impersonations she insisted on doing as well, especially the one
of Ed Sullivan introducing the Beatles, kept me awake and in
the end she had to go. I followed suit and enrolled at Washington
and Lee, where the talented Guernsey reappeared at a banquet
dinner as the main dish. (It must have been her because I was
asleep before the after dinner speeches began!)

Washington and Lee I found to be an engaging place, “a bastion
of higher learning and a bailiwick of recreation.” I read that in
a brochure sent mistakenly by the University, which turned
out to be about some dude ranch for Spanish-American War vet-
erans in Arizona. Nevertheless, the description aptly applies to
W&L, though there were raised eyebrows when I first arrived
in Lexington bearing a desert survival kit, a Roosevelt poster,
and sixteen changes of underwear.

Certainly, with variation and challenge the W&L existence is
loaded. At least, the guest lecturer at the first seminar I attended
was loaded. His talk had been on Iberian culture and at the
reception afterwards he chased one of the deans with a fork,
shouting that he was about to plant the Portuguese flag in the
dean’s ribs and claim his appendix for Isabella or Ferdinand,
whichever one was at home. Of course, it didn’t happen quite
that way; it might have been a soup spoon, now that I think.
The point is that life at W&L is not uneventful and, except for
occasional nightmares in which Charlton Heston offers to recite
the entire book of Genesis backwards to a plumbers’ convention,
that life is pleasant. Professors take an active interest in the
student and, unless the student habitually wears stripped ties with
plaid shirts or grows asparagus for profit in his window sill,
then the professors might even be persuaded to teach MA ete
manners, if nothing else. The Lexington scenery impresses, the
architecture appeals, the distant girl schools beckon, the com-
munity thrives and the local A&P stocks Ben Franklin cigars.
What else can there possibly be?

Q—How many volumes does W&L’s library contain?

A—Ha, ha. Good impersonation of a freshman. Can you do a Guernsey
trampling Ed Sullivan?

Generals fall to Hopkins, 11-10

By BOB BRAND

The Washington and Lee Gen-
erals came knocking but they
couldn’t quite get in the door.

Rick Kowalchuk scored with
a little less than two minutes
left to play to give Johns Hop-
kins an 11-10 come-from-behind
victory over the Generals in the
NCAA lacrosse semi-finals Satur-
day, May 25, in Baltimore, Md.
The goal by Kowalchuk capped
a furious Hopkins rally in the
fourth period and ended Wash-
ington and ‘Lee’s most success-
ful lacrosse season ever.

W&L finished the year with a
15-1 record and the No. 3 posi-
tion in the polls. The loss was
particularly disheartening to
coach Jack Emmer and his play-
ers because a victory over Hop-
kins would not only have given
the Generals a shot at the nat-
ional championship but more im-
portantly would have gained
them the recognition as a la-
crosse power, recognition that
has eluded them the past two
years. But, unfortunately, it
wasn’t to be.

Teddy Bauer thrilled the large
contingent of W&L fans at the
game by controlling the opening
face-off and firing a shot past
Hopkins goalie Kevin Mahon
with only nine seconds gone off

the clock. Cahill of Hopkins re-
taliated by scoring two minutes
later and the nip and tuck pat-
tern of the first half was estab-
lished. The teams went into the
dressing rooms at the half tied
5-5.

Kowalchuk opened the _ scor-
ing in the third period but his
tally was followed by four un-
answered goals by the Generals.
Dave Warfield’s score tied the
game up and was followed by
two straight goals by Bryan
Chasney. Skip Lichtfuss ended
the outburst by flipping in his
third goal of the game to give
W&L a 9-6 lead.

With only two minutes left in
the third period Cahill scored
again to cut the Generals’ lead
to two, 9-7. Bill Rienhoff got the
goal right back for the Generals
by scoring his third goal of the
game in the first minute of the
fourth quarter, but after that it
was all Hopkins.

The Blue Jays were able to
control the game and take ad-
vantage of four fourth quarter
penalties against the Generals —
to score four consecutive goals
without an answer from W&L.
The victory allowed Hopkins to
advance to the NCAA finals
against the University of Mary-
land, who they defeated.

Several Generals played bril-
liantly in defeat. Goalie Skeet
Chadwick ended his career with
20 saves despite being pelted
with 58 shots by Hopkins. The
performance should earn him All-
American honors for the year.
Skip Lichtfuss capped his out-
standing athletic career at W&L
by scoring three goals and pick-
ing up seven ground balls. Senior
‘Bryan Chasney, probably the
most underrated General, had
another fine day with two goals
and two assists. Bill Rienhoff also

had a good day with three goals.

The W&L defense deserves
credit for holding Hopkins’ usu-
ally high scoring attack to only
two goals and two assists. The
trio of Jim Farrer, Tom Keigler
and Rob Lindsey has played very
well all season. Special mention
should be made about the job
Rob Lindsey did to All-American
Jack Thomas. Lindsey was like
fly paper on Thomas all after-
noon and shut the Hopkins star
out for only the second time in
his career.
