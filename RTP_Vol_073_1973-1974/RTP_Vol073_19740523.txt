Report studies
area economy

More than 25 per cent of all
money spent in Lexington—$s
million of a $31.4 million total
spending volume—traces back
to Washington and Lee Univer-
sity, according to a _ detailed
statistical study of the univer-
sity’s impact on the local money.

The study also showed that
more than $5 million in personal
income to local residents derives
directly from Washington and
Lee.

Covering the 1971-72 fiscal
vear, the study was conducted
by Dr. Edward C. Atwood Jr.,
dean of W&L’s School of Com-
merce, Economics and Politics,
with four student research as-
sistants.

Their report, which took two
vears to complete, was based on
a standard model developed by
the American Council on Educa-
tion in Washington, D.C. Only
firm economic statistics were in-
cluded in the impact study, with
no reference to social, political,
educational or other intangible
benefits to the city from W&L’s
presence,

Other points brought out in
the study include:

—Half the $8 million spent in
Lexington which can be traced
to W&L was spent directly by
the university itself and by its
employees and_ students. The
other half came partly from re-
spending by local residents of
money the university spent in
the city, and partly from spend-
ing by local businesses specific-
ally in order to supply the uni-
versity with goods and services.

—The university employs 430
persons, and another 400 jobs
locally can be traced directly to
Washington and Lee.

—Local banks have expanded
their credit base by $2.7 million
as a result of Washington and
Lee-related deposits.

In statistical terms, the study
indicated that the city budget is
the only element of the local
economy in which the university
receives more than it gives in
return.

The university, its employees,
and its students accounted for
$663,051 in government spending
in the year of the study, 1971-72,
including schools, police and fire
protection, sanitation, public
works and other government
services. The university account-
ed for only 57 per cent of that
in tax revenues to the city
treasury, $379,457.

The report cautions, however,

that taxes paid to the city by
other elements of the Lexington
economy which benefit directly
from the university’s presence—
people and businesses whose in-
come comes in part from Wé&L
spending — “would, without a
doubt, much more than offset
any disadvantage that might be
indicated.”

A state law, which was intro-
duced and passed with the en-
dorsement of Washington and
Lee, technically permits Lexing-
ton to assess a “service charge”
on the university for property
used as faculty residences. W&L
has about 30 units of that type
faculty housing. But an unex-
pected amendment in the Gen-
eral Assembly last year prohibit-
ed cities from including the cost
of operating public schools in the
formula to fix the “service
charge.” And with school costs
excluded, Lexington officials de-
termined it would cost the city
as much to make the required
assessments and carry out other
state procedures as the city would
receive in revenue.

Residents of faculty housing
do, however, pay the full rate for
city water and sewer service.

The report did not include in
its data the value of scholarships
Washington and Lee _ provides,
automatically, for the sons of
every Lexington and Rockbridge
County resident who attends the
university. This year, the pro-
gram has donated more than
$100,000 to local residents.

The total Washington and Lee
operating budget in 1971-72, the
year covered by the study, was
$6.8 million.

Trustees to tour
fine arts facilities

The upcoming quarterly meet-
ing of W&L’s Board of Trustees
plans to open with a first-hand
evaluation of the  university’s
fine arts facilities. Tomorrow
morning, from 11-12:30 a.m, the
Trustees have scheduled a visit
to the music, art and drama de-
partments. They will be ac-
companied by representatives of
the Administration and by assign-
ed tour leaders. In addition, each
department will be staffed with
a faculty member and two stu-
dents, available to answer and
to provoke questions from the
Board’s members.

Sandy Stradtman, a member of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, has been
named as the outstanding fresh-
man fraternity member by the
Interfraternity Council. The
award was revived this year to
honor the freshman who excels
in many different facets of
campus life.

Eight freshmen were nominat-
ed for the honor. Where many
of the other candidates had
equal qualifications, Stradtman
Was thought to possess and ex:
hibit a special type of leadership.
Stradtman was this year’s vice-
president of the freshman class
and will represent the sophomore
class on the UC next year.

Not only is Stradtman an out-
standing leader of the class of
‘77 but is highly regarded and
respected by others in his class
He excels in the academic field
as well, now holding a grade
point average of about 3.8.
THE RING-TUM PHI

 

 

A survey of the Phi

We have run across a survey of Washington and Lee students
which asked those students questions about the performance of
this year’s Ring-ttum Phi. We thought we’d pass on the results of
that survey.

Of the 117 surveys handed out, 116 were returned. The 117th
person said he didn’t want to return the survey for fear of being
too obscene in his criticism of the Phi.

All but two said they read the Phi weekly.

What did the students who were surveyed look for in the pages
of the Phi? There were 51 who sought news (44%), 24 who looked
for editorials and letters to the editor (21%), 20 who sought sports
(17%), and 19 who read the Phi specifically for Ask Traveller.
Traveller would be pleased.

Now comes our shining hour. When asked what they disliked
most about the Phi, the students surveyed listed the “editorial we”
of this column—Paul J. Lancaster—first. Also disliked were lack of
rea] journalism and lack of total coverage.

Those surveyed would like more campus news and features, less
opinion columns.

Three-fifths of those surveyed said they’d like to see the Phi ex-
pand to twice-weekly coverage.

Comments ranged from “I wish it wouldn’t be so conservative,”
to “it’s obviously published by a bourgeois editor,” to “afraid to
express opinion,” to an occasional “editorials are well though out.”

We are not particularly surprised by the survey results. We are
pleased that apparently most everybody surveyed at least looks at
the paper when it is published on Thursdays. We are also pleased
that the students seem to want more news coverage in the Phi. If
nothing else, it presents itself as a goal to which future editors can
aspire much as the complete W&L man aspires to that perfect
tubing run down Goshen Pass.

This writer personally finds merit in the fact that he is the most
disliked part of the Phi, according to the survey. After all, one can-
not be disliked for his editorial opinion if one’s editorial opinion
isn’t read. At least the editorials were read.

This writer is a bit concerned at being labeled “conservative,”
“pourgeois,” and “afraid to express opinion.” The Executive Commit-
tee, the University Council, those interested in the Honor System,
and the faculty might tend to disagree with that last statement, or
at least this writer hopes they would.

—P.J.L.

Parting shots

As the year and our tenure as editor end, it is time we took a
few parting shots.

—To the Executive Committee: Talk of real accomplishment—
important changes in the Honor System, co-education, fine arts de-
velopment, and the like—has been digested into the bowels of W&L
‘bureaucracy, adding to the general constipation of this university’s
progress. This is not to chastise the entire EC; we only criticize the
majority who are using their positions as tickets to “Who’s Who in
American Colleges and Universities.”

—To those in control of the university Honor System: It’s dying.
Save it. If honor be “a nebulous thing” as those supposedly in the
know claim it is, not when it is so nebulous that right cannot be dis-
tinguished from wrong.

—To the student representatives on the University Council: Ex-
jpress the views of the students; don’t vote the way you think the
faculty wants you to vote. It’s seems a trivial point, but time after
time this year a seeming majority of the students on the UC were
downright intimidated by the faculty, whether the faculty was trying
to intimidate or not.

—To the faculty: A motion passed by the faculty at its latest
meeting gave the presiding officer the power to release edited
minutes of those closed meetings. Release those minutes next year;
respect the students’ right to know what goes on around this place.

Finally, we part with a few hopes:

—That the Honor System be treated with the respect it deserves.

—That the issue of coeducation be revived and resolved.

—That the fine arts develop fully on this culturally-starved
campus.

—That W&L advances to and wins the national lacrosse champ-
jonships next weekend at Rutgers.

—P.J.L.

OUTLOOK and REVIEW] |

Thursday, May 23, 1974

Ask Traveller

Q—s there any truth to the rumor that lacrosse causes baldness or,
at the very least, taleum powder burns behind the ears?

A—Of course not, except perhaps after those close scrimmages with
Mr. Sammy’s Tonsorial College of Towson.

Extensive tests conducted last week at the Hagerstown Out-
let in Lexington refuted the old medical myth that overexposure
to lacrosse leads to premature loss of hair among young adults
and Jehovah’s Witnesses. However, it does appear that the sport
is directly linked to an attentuating form of insanity that causes
the victim to misplace his mother and express a keen desire to
stop breathing at the dinner table.

“Maryland seems to be the hardest hit by this disease,” said
Dr. Hoagie Morrill at the Outlet, “due probably to the state’s
traditional tolerance towards the playing of lacrosse and interior
decorating. Now, whether or not the sport leads to insanity alone
or to poor taste in home furnishings as well is not yet known,
but it is interesting to note that one half of all the boys playing
lacrosse at W&L from Chevy Chase have tacky Norman Rockwel!
prints, Jimi Hendrix posters, and bronzed cholostomy bags hung
in their dorm rooms. Now THAT’S bad taste!” Official spokesmen
in Baltimore reject the Outlet findings and, in an act of overt
faith, have publicly endorsed Snoopy posters, calendars, and
other nifty college decorations for the sole use of Maryland boys
and girls away at school.

Nevertheless, Dr. Morrill insists that lacrosse can be extremely
hazardous and warns that the vocal cords are the first sites of
bodily malfunction. “Why, just look at the members of the
W&L lacrosse team,” he said. “So great is their inability to speak
plainly, that such commonplace names as Tom, Dick, Harry, and
Leopold are somehow garbled on the playing field into Weeb,
Skeeter, Chaz, and other equally inarticulate grunts. Heavens,
they all sound like Eliza Doolittle swallowing marbles.”

Historically, the “heartbreak of lacrosse’ made its first
appearance in this country when Brother LeRoy, a Dominican
monk and part-time insurance adjuster for Allstate, introduced
the rugged game to the plains Indians, who up to this point
had favored canasta at a penny a point. Lacrosse caught on like
Michigan tree moss and before the hunting season ended every
red-blooded savage with any moxie at all was facing-off and
moving his pick, (not in front of the children, of course). Brother
LeRoy, knowing which side his crucifix was nailed, returned
East and sold the rights of the game to Parker Brothers in 1658.
Meanwhile, though, disaster struck. The lacrosse-minded war-
riors on the plains began to feel listless and out of sorts, and,

despite heavy doses of castor oil and St. Joseph aspirin, took up
crocheting and needle-point. Thus, the game of lacrosse and its
accompanying plague nevermore darkened a Western sunset.
Not surprisingly, canasta reasserted itself as a frontier favorite,
but this time at a nickle a point.

And now, the Middle Atlantic region, (thought originally to
be a Dutch practical joke), feels the weight of the Redman’s
Burden. A special serum, made from distilled gatorade, is cur-
rently being tested on white rats and J.V. goalies in the distant
hope that the menace of lacrosse can be halted in our life-time,
or at least before the Hopkins game. In the meantime, Dr. Morrill
suggests that lacrosse enthusiasts find other types of divertment,
such as canasta at a quarter a point, just to liven things up.

Q—But surely there must be a cure now.
A—There is. Take up a collection and send Jack, Skeet, T-Bear and
the entire state of Maryland to Australia for good.

Letters to the Editor

On the exchange program with Virginia Union

From the administration

Sir:

This letter is in response to
Mr. Reeves’s article criticizing
the exchange program with Vir-
ginia Union. Let me begin by
agreeing with Mr. Reeves’s re-
marw that, “In the last analysis
it is up to our Admissions Office
to find their own competent
black recruits.” It is, indeed, the
responsibility of Washington
and Lee to continue to recruit
degree candidates from among
the able members of ethnic and
racial minorities but this pro-
gram cannot fulfill that objective;
the exchange agreement specifi-
eally precludes an exchange stu-
dent from transferring to the
host institution.

Our purpose in the Virginia
Union exchange is, partly, to add
another dimension to our cir-
riculum since Virginia Union
offers programs in urban studies,
social welfare, and elementary
education which Washington and
Lee cannot offer. Virginia Union
also affords our students the op-
portunity to sample life on an
urban campus with a predomi-
nantly black student body; we
recognize that some _ students,
for valid reasons, may want such
an opportunity and, at the same
time, desire to spend most of
their four undergraduate years on
the Washington and Lee campus;
the exchange agreement allows
them to do so without severing
their connection with Washing-
ton and Lee. Finally, the ex-
change may bring some black
women to the Washington and
Lee campus, functioning as our

present exchange programs do in
ading some diversity to our stu-
dent body. I might add that Vir-
ginia Union’s character as a pri-
vate institution affords it more
flexibility in entering into such
arrangements.

I do not think a Letter-to-the-
Editors column is an appropriate
place to argue the complex ques-
tion of measuring quality in edu-
cation. I would simply remark
that, under long-standing faculty
regulations, a Washington and
Lee student may receive as many
as 12 credits towards his Wash-
ington and Lee degree from sum-
mer school work undertaken at
any other fully accredited four-
year institution and a_ student
transferring to Washington and
Lee may receive as many as 87
credits towards his Washington
and Lee degree for work under-
taken at another fully accredited
institution. The exchange agree-
ment simply facilitates a possi-
bility that already exists for our
students while offering reciprocal
opportunities to some Virginia
Union students,

Sincerely yours,

Robert W. McAhren

Associate Dean of the College
Exchange Program Officer

From a freshman

Siz

I would like to go on record
as opposing the recent article by
editor-elect Reeves concerning
the new exchange program with
Virginia Union. I feel that his
analysis of the program was very
narrow.

First of all, Mr. Reeves’ main

 

Ed. note—Last week, a let-
ter to the editor printed on
this page attacked a supposed
“independent conspiracy” at
Washington and Lee. The sig-
nature atached to the letter
said “Beau Dudley.”

Beau Dudley did not write
that letter.

Rather, the letter was writ-
ten as an apparent joke, a
joke which had the intention
of making Mr. Dudley look
like the fool which he cer-
tainly is not. The only fool
is the letter-writer.

We extend our apologies to
Mr. Dudley for printing the
letter, although it was not
directly our fault. The letter
was received much as any
other letter in the Phi office.
We ran it, assuming that the
atmosphere of honor which
supposedly encircles this cam-
pus would deem the letter-
writer as the person whose
name was attached to the bot-
tom of the letter.

 

With that letter, W&L’s
atmosphere of honor became a
little more polluted.

Mr. Dudley’s reply

To whom it may concern,

I have virtually no idea to
whom I am addressing this
letter, so excuse me if I don’t
get the point across.

In short, your letter in last
week’s paper exhibited so
little intelligence that I don’t
think I’ll waste the time to
write a lengthy rebuttal. I
will say only that fortunately
my friends and those who
know me realized, for obvious
reasons, that I could not have
written the letter. I can only
guess at what you were at-
tempting to accomplish, and
in any case you have my
sympathy for your condition
of mind.

Sincerely,
(the real) Beau Dudley ’74

 

 

THE RING-TUM PHI

premise concerning the ability
of Virginia Union students to
perform at W&L is not sound.
One cannot deny the empirical]
data that Mr. Reeves presents but
one can question his operational
definition for college achieve-
ment: performance on a _ test
taken in high school. Many educa-
tors believe that test scores such
as SAT scores are not an adequ-
ate measure of college perform-
ance. In fact there are probably
students who did poorly on SAT’s
and are doing well here and
vice versa. If Mr. Reeves is able
to say how any given student,
much less a group of students,
will do at W&L, then I believe
that he should offer his services
to the Admissions office.

Another point that Mr. Reeves
makes is that by allowing these
students to come here, the Uni-
versity has nothing to gain and
it may even hurt itself. By per-
mitting any student to study
here, the University gains the
input that only that individual
can contribute. The other part
of Mr. Reeves’ argument sug-
gests that W&L should act only
towards its own benefit. This
suggestion for personal utilitar-
ianism seems to reject the role

Washington and

of W&L as a contributor to the
community of which it is a mem-
ber.

In closing, I would suggest that
Mr. Reeves should reconsider his
analysis of the exchange pro-
gram with Virginia Union. His
initial analysis appears to be ex-
tremely limited, at least to this
reader.

Sincerely,
Stephen Q. Giblin ’77

From a senior

With only ten days until
graduation, I, a black student at
Washington & Lee, could have
ignored Jess Reeves’ polemic or
analysis concerning the upcom-
ing exchange program with Vir-
ginia Union University.

I am unable to ignore such
slanderous statements leveled at
a black institution of the caliber
of Virginia Union without some
response. Regretfully, the article
reflects the fears and prejudices
of a mind so blighted by bigotry
that it refuses to report the
situation with any degree of
fairness.

Mr. Reeves used statistical data
out of context to create an un-

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Pusey first winner of
Mason endowment

Dr. William W. Pusey HI, a
German teacher at Washington
and Lee for 35 years and former
Gean of the college and acting
president of the university, has
deen named the first holder of
the recently established 8. Blount
Mason chair.

The appointment was made
and announced by Washington
and Lee’s board of trustees. The
endowed chair was established in
recognition of bequests made
through two trusts created by
Mason and his wife. Washington
and Lee’s share of the trusts
totaled nearly a half-million dol-
Jars, which the Masons directed
should be used to strengthen fac-
ulty salaries.

Dr. Pusey served as dean of
the college, Washington and Lee’s

liberal-arts and sciences division,
from 1960 to 1971. He was act-
ing president as well as dean
from the time Dr. Fred C. Cole
resigned in 1967 until his suc-
cessor, Robert E. R. Huntley, as-
sumed office Feb. 5, 1968.

Dr. Pusey is head of the Ger-
man department and_ teaches
courses in comparative literature
and in Russian language as well
as German. He is also director
of W&L’s Chinese studies pro-
gram, which he began to develop
almost as soon as he left the
deanship three years ago.

Dr. Pusey is the only teacher
at Washington and Lee ever to
have received two “Ring-tum
Phi” Awards, given annually by
the student newspaper.

Letters to the Editor

Calyx criticized
Sir:

I wish to congratulate the
Calyx staff for once again suc-
ceeding in surprising me where
1 thought that there was no room
left for surprise. I had conclud-
ed that last year’s Calyx, albeit
in all its esoteric banality, was
unsurpassable in irrelevance. As
is sometimes the case, I was
proved wrong. This years Calyx,
admittedly chock-full of quite ad-
mirable photography, has reach-
ed the pinnacle of functional
triviality. I have often heard of
going from the ridiculous to the
sublime, but to go from the
ridiculous to the more ridicul-

ous is just that.
In Artsy-Craftsy Awe,
I Remain,
Jack E. Altman ITI

Criticism criticized

Calyx ed. note: Although I
shouldn’t even give your letter
the dignity of a reply, I thank
you for your sincere thought-
ful critricism. I also appreciat-
ed the aid and suggestions you
provided for me and my staff
throughout the year. I must
say, however, that it amazes
me that your criticism came
before I hardly had a chance
to look at the thing myself.

See you in the afterlife,
D.B.H.

ROTC not in danger

By TOM RITTENBURG

Ever since the ending of the
draft two years ago, local rumors
have been predicting the demise
of the Military Science depart-
ment of Washington and Lee,
predicting an end to the school’s
Reserve Officer Training Corps
program.

Those rumors were seemingly
substantiated last March when
the Pentagon announced a desire
to eliminate all college ROTC pro-
grams with fewer than 17 juniors
enrolled.

This year, 15 juniors are en-
rolled in the W&L ROTC pro-
gram.

Col. Louis McFadden, professor
of Military Science, says that
while the W&L ROTC program is

being reviewed by the Pentagon,
so to are all other campus ROTC
units.

According to Col. McFadden,
the criteria for terminating a
campus ROTC unit are all in-
clusive. The army will review
not only the quantity of officers
produced by a unit, but also the
quality. The performance of the
Wé&L cadet corps at summer
camp and in the service after
graduation, and the prestige and
support of the school are all
taken into consideration.

The quantity of cadets at W&L
has been decreasing in recent
vears, but, according to Col. Me-
Fadden, the quality remains high.
He says the school has also been
continuing its support of the
ROTC program.

Col. McFadden says next year’s
class will increase in size over
that of this year’s, and two new
officers are being assigned to
W&L ROTC unit. He says pros-
pects for continuation of ROTC
at W&L in the future are bright.

to be awarded

honorary degrees

A Lexington native and a
former dean at Washington and
Lee University are among four
men who will receive honorary
degrees next week from the uni-
versity at graduation.

Dr. Robert O. Paxton, profes-
sor of modern European history
at Columbia University, and Dr.
James Graham Leyburn, dean at
Washington and Lee from 1947 to
1956 and sociology professor until
his retirement in 1972, will re-
ceive the doctor of letters de-
gree,

Also receiving the doctor of
letters degree will be Thomas K.
Wolfe, a leader in the “new”
journalism and author of “Elec-
tric Kool-Aid Acid Test,” “Radical
Chie” and other books. Justice
Alex M. Harman Jr. of the Su-
preme Court of Virginia will re-
ceive the honorary doctor of laws
degree.

Paxton, Wolfe and Harman are
graduate of Washington and Lee.
Leyburn is a graduate of Duke,
Princeton and Yale Universities.

The W&L graduation, conclud-
ing the institution’s 224th year,
will take place Thursday (May

By long-standing tradition the
commencement address will be

Robert E. R. Huntley.

Paxton is the son of Mr. and
Mrs. M. W. Paxton Sr. of Lexing-
ton. In his senior year at Wash-
ington and Lee he was named a
Rhodes Scholar and studied at
Oxford University from 1954 un-
til 1956. He earned his Ph.D. from
Harvard University in 1963.

Paxton taught at Berkeley and
the State University of New
York at Stony Brook before join-

ing the faculty at Columbia in
1969.
He is the author of “Parades

and Polities at Vichy,” published
by the Princeton University Press
in 1966, and “Vichy France: Old
Guard and New Order,” publish-
ed in 1972 by Alfred A. Knopf.
“Vichy France’—which by co-
incidence was dedicated in part
to Paxton’s fellow honorary de-
gree recipient Leyburn— was
translated into French and pub-
lished last year in Paris.

Paxton is currently working on
a textbook history of Europe
since 1914, with publication
ylanned next spring.

As a W&L student he was vice
president of the student body
and was elected to membership
in Phi Beta Kappa and Omicron
Delta Kappa leadership frater-
nity. He was a member of Sigma
\jpha Epsilon social fraternity
as well.

taught at

Leyburn,
Martinsburg,

now a
W. Va.,

Hollins College and Princeton
University before joining the
clology faculty at Yale in 1927.
Twenty vears later he left Yale
for Washington and Lee to be-
come dean of the university. In
1955, he concluded he would have
to choose between teaching and
administrative duties, and left
the deanship to become head of
the sociology and anthropology
department at W&L.

He is the author of the classic
“Haitian People,” winner in 1941
of the Anisfield-Wolf Award as
the best work of the year in race
relations; “Handbook of Ethno-
graphy,” “World Minority Prob-
lems,” and “The Scotch-Irish: A
Social] History,’ Leyburn has also
written a large number of schol-
arly articles and reviews.

As dean at W&L, Leyburn pro-
posed a 10-point plan for aca-
demic development at the Uni-
versity which in large measure
guided Washington and _ Lee
over the subsequent quarter-cen-
tury.

When he retired from teaching,
the Norfolk Virginia-Pilot com-
mented in an editorial: “He rais-
ed scholastic standards and re-
cruited distinguished teachers.
‘The Leyburn Spirit’ inspired a
generation of students and
brought W&L to the front rank
of small men’s schools.”

In retirement Leyburn is
working on another book, con-
tinues to write articles and re-
views, and delivers frequent pub-
lic lectures. A former president
of the Rockbridge Historical So-
ciety, Leyburn has also recently
completed an introduction to a
reprint of Henry Boley’s 1936
anecdotal history “Lexington in
Old Virginia,” to be re-issued
later this year by Washington
and Lee.

Wolfe is the author of “The
Pump House Gang” as well as
“Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test” and
“Radical Chic and Mau-Mauing
the Flak-Catchers.” An extensive
study by Wolfe, “The New Journ-
alism,” which also includes an
anthology he co-edited, will be
published next month by Harper
& Row.

Wolfe was editor of “Shenan-
doah,” Washington and _ Lee’s
literary quarterly, his junior and
senior years. He was also sports
editor of the student newspaper
and humor magazine while a
WE&L student.

Justice Harman received his
law degree from Washington and
Lee in 1944. After graduation he
began practicing law in Pulaski,
and in 1964 was elected circuit
court judge there. He was named
to the Virginia Supreme Court
in 1969,

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Sports opinion

 

By BILL AUSTIN

Ring-tum Phi Sports Editor

lve come to the end of my
stint as resident hack for Ring-
tum Phi sports, and long for a
way to close out my career with
suitable aplomb. To be sure, I’m
not one who should venture gen-
eralization about sport and life,
or sport and writing, or sport
nd anything. Quite honestly,
‘ve had enough difficulty de-
ining sport on its own terms.
At any rate, much of what I’ve
written about this year has
merely scratched the surface of
sport in acknowledgment of
scores, performers, turning-
points, in an attempt to give an
“opjective” description of a par-
ticular event.

mh bed 95

Yet, I’m much intrigued by the
creative latitude inherent in writ-
ing of sport. For instance, a base-
ball game can be the stuff of a
tersely worded summary or of
significant literature. Such is the
case with Robert Coover’s The
Universal Baseball Association,
Inc., J. Henry Waugh, Prop., a
novel which traces the fall of a
J. Henry Waugh, sole proprietor
of the UBA, a baseball league
in which the hitting, pitching and
fielding is but the toss of three
dice (that’s 216 different combi-
nations). The eight-team affair
is staffed with players the likes
of Long Lew Lydell and Syca-
more Flynn (the names make
the men) and passesses its own
history, kept in the 40-volumed
“Book,” a distinctive folklore,
and naturally, a pantheon of
heroes. Damon Rutherford is the
star of the 56th season, a rookie
pitcher whose special skill and
poise earn him a special place
in Waugh’s heart. Surely he is
the golden boy who will lift the
league from its prolonged
slump.

 

Alas, the figure of salvation is
felled by a pitch to his head,
and life for the league—and for
Henry Waugh—loses its fineness,
its meaning. Henry attains a mea-
sure of vengeance when, by

tampering with the dice, he se-
cures the death of Jock Casey,
the hurler who’d tossed the fatal
ball to young Damon. However,
the act violates the rules of the
game, and as a result, the Pro-
prietor plunges into a shadowy
realm of madness.

The creatures of his imagina-
tion then take control, forgetful
of their Creator, suspicious of the
nature and value of the game
to which they devote their be-
ings. While the novel ends with
an affirmation of the sport—
“it’s just what it is...” Waugh’s
fite is much less hopeful. He
appears to have forfeited his
identity to the game of his own
making. In a real sense, God is

undone by fate. Heady stuff for
a baseball novel!

Coover’s book is one of several
notable works perused in Dr,
Ray’s spring seminar, an English
course entitled Literature and
Sport. When first announced as
an academic offering, the class
drew more than its share of
guffaws from professors and stu-
dents alike. Some hinted that the
seminar would be more _ favor-
ably received if housed in
Doremus Gym than in Payne
Hall. Then there was the prob-
lem of where to place the train-
ing-meal table...

On the contrary, sport litera-
ture has been treated seriously,
intensely, by the course partici-

pants. Dr. Ray has encouraged
students to look beyond playing-
field or locker-room scenes to
some sort of statement about
man’s need for his games. On the
other hand, symbols haven’t been
forced upon students in a rush
for profundity. The observant
now know that George in The
Year Boston Won the Penant was
none other than George Scott,
slick-fielding first sacker more
recently traded to Milwaukee, In
truth, “Sport and Literature” has
effected the same balance be-
tween statistic and mystery that
gives baseball its continuity, its
longevity. Score it a triumph for
the seminar in a clean sweep of
its critics.

Generals meet Johns Hopkins

in bid for NCAA lacrosse

By BILL FLESHER

Washington and Lee exhibited
a new angle of the magician’s
act Saturday, showing nothing up
its sleeve for three quarters,
then pulling out a “Rave” and
a rally in the final period for
an 11-9 win over Navy in a
quarterfinal game in the NCAA
University Division Lacrosse
Championships.

Dave “Rave” Warfield, who
had been a nemesis to the Mid-
shipmen twice before, assumed
the role again, scoring four and
adding two assists, All but one
of Warfield’s goals came in the
final fifteen minutes.

Warfield sparked a_ five-goal
outburst which brought W&L
from a 7-5 third quarter defecit
to a 10-7 lead midway through the
final period. Navy closed the gap
to 10-9 late in the game, but
Warfield’s final goal with :14
left sealed the Middies’ fate.

In the three games against
Navy over the past two seasons,
Warfield has scored 13 goals and
six assists, including a five goal,
four assists performance in the
13-10 W&L win at Annapolis
earlier this season.

“I can’t explain why David
does as well as he does against
Navy,” W&L head coach Jack
Emmer said after the game. “It’s
not really any sort of abnormal]
performance for him, since he
gets five to six points every
game.”

It was a move by Emmer
which sprung Warfield and the
Generals on their fourth quarter
tear.

“IT didn’t think any of their
middies could handle David, so
we put Roger Rydell! in the game
on attack and pulled David out.
Then we ran a middie out, force-
ing one of their midfielders to
play David as he came in.”

Warfield gave the Middies’ mid-
fielders fits. In a two-minute

span during the fina] period, he
scored two goals and fed Ted
Bauer and Bill Rienhoff for two
others.

“Somehow David always comes
up with a big game against
Navy,” Emmer said. “Why only
David knows. Maybe it’s Szlasa,
but that’s only a guess.”

For Navy coach Dick Szlasa,
it marked the third time his
troops lost to W&L since he left
Lexington two years ago. And,
for the second straight year,
Navy had been eliminated from
the tournament by Washington
and Lee.

in the year,” Emmer said. “Their
defense was excellent for three
quarters, and they controlled the
ball much better.”

Emmer credited Szlasa’s tactic
to go with six defensemen when
W&L was on the attack as a big
part of Navy’s early success.

“They had used this when they
beat Johns Hopkins, and it work-
ed well for them there,’ Emmer
said. “It caused us to mishandle
some situations, and it threw our
offense off a bit.”

Navy jumped out to a quick
2-0 lead on goals by Mike Dow
and Joe Avveduti. W&L came
back to tie it in the fourth
minute, as Warfield and Ralph
Jaugher tallied within 34 sec-
onds of each other. Marty Ma-
son’s goal at 11:57 gave Navy a
3-2 lead, which they held until
the second period.

Bryan Chasney and Navy’s
Tom Venier traded goals early
in the quarter to make it 4-3.
Then Rienhoff and Bauer scored
within 35 seconds to give the
Generals their first lead at 5-4.
However Bauer’s goal, an extra
man tally, was the last W&L
got for 27 minutes.

The Middies tied the game at
5-5 when Avveduti scored his sec-
ond with :40 left in the first half.
Davy Bayly and Avveduti got
the only goals in the third period,
and, with only one quarter left,
We&L trailed 7-5.

“Navy controlled us in the
third quarter,” Emmer said. “We
were a little slow in the period,

and they were able to keep the
ball most of the time.”

But the fourth quarter held no
silence in store for W&L. Bauer
got his second extra man goal at
2:20 to cut the defecit to 74.
Then Warfield scored his second
on the play Emmer had designed
during a television time out to
tie the score at 7-7. Eighteen sec-
onds later, Bauer took a War-
field pass and scored another
extra man goal to put the Gen-
erals in front 8-7. Rienhoff, at
7:06, converted a Warfield feed
into a goal to make it 9-7, and at
7:29, Warfield got his third to
give W&L a 10-7 lead.

But Navy wasn’t through yet.

Bayly scored his second goal,
breaking a 17-minute Navy
scoring drought, with four

minutes left to cut the W&L lead
to 10-8. Then Jeff Long scored at
the end of a fast break, and
Navy was within a goal with
it leg.

“I had thought of last year
when Navy came back when it
when it was 10-7,” Emmer said,
“And, when it was 10-9, I knew
the game could be decided by the
one faceoff.”

Bauer, who had not done well
all day in the faceoff department,
was sent out to take the face-
off against Navy’s Bill Ayres, the
Middies’ faceoff specialist. This
time, however, Bauer got the ball,
and the Generals took the driv-
er’s seat.

Jess reveals in his article that

very little about humanity, and
black people especially. SAT

Jess, Virginia Union, not un-

cause whites have the power to
define what “fine” is. But for
me to defend Union would be
almost ridiculous as your attack-
ing it. So, if you are worried
about “what they will ship to
Lexington,” I suggest you wait
around and see. It might just
shock you to know that there
are brilliant black students at-
tending black institutions, or that
there are brilliant black students.

I am appalled at your article’s
tactlessness. You might just as
well have said, “Lets keep them
in their places,” and saved some
typing space. Who are you to
judge people you have never met?
Indeed, the way you interpret
facts, who are you to judge? For
four years I have had to tolerate
such injustices done to black
people by those who show such
shortsightedness, and who at the
same time claim to be crusad-
ing for academic excellence. Are
you altogether sure you know
fhat academic excellence really
is, Jess?

To the students and faculty of
Virginia Union I must apologize
for the tactless error made by
the prospective editor of our
newspaper for next year. I have
tried to fight attitudes such as
his since I have been here. I
have tried to show such students
that black people are as capable
as they are. However, I could

The Generals now move to the

Criticizing Calyx
Sir,

Well, the yearbooks are out
again and look what we have
for the third year in a row—a
jumble of such pop-art objects
of aesthetic beauty as an air
conditioner filter, a group of
tangled rubber pipes, a half-page
layout of bolts, two people (sex
unrecognizable) practicing one of
the more complicated positions
from the Kama Sutra, and some
photographs of a truly incompre-
hensible nature. Perhaps my re-
action is simply a reflection of
my poor taste. But I don’t think
so.

Now really, does this annual
include what its editor says it
does on page 156. He claims that
it gives a glimpse of “a bit of
everybody ...the topsider in his

khakis, the politician in seer-
suckers, the freak in shredded
patches,” and certainly those

terms do represent the extremes
of the spectrum of the W&L
student body.

However, to say that this year-
book of 1974 does not portray
the “spectrum” is an understate-
ment, Aside from the group pic-
tures of the fraternities, which
I suppose the editor had to in-
clude, there is nary a mention
of Greek life in the rest of the
annual. As much as some here
enjoy denying it, the frats do
play some small part in Wé&L
life.

A critic of what I have said
might challenge me to compose a
better Calyx. Frankly I think
anyone could make a better one.

Sincerely yours,
Barney Skelton, ’75
