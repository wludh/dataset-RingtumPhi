Budget adopted; Phi’s funds cut $1200

By ROBERT PUGH
The Executive Committee tenta-
tively approved its yearly budget

Monday night. Student Body
President Doug ‘Schwartz en-
couraged students to voice

opinions and suggestions before
the final discussion next Monday
night.

Vice President and ex officio
Treasurer Steve Green submitted
a proposed budget of $27,200 de-
rived from the $17 student tax.
He stated that the major change
from last year’s budget is that
law students no longer pay for
the Calyx and Ring-tum Phi and
undergrads do not pay for the
Student. Bar Association.

After a lengthy debate, Junior
Representative Bob Keatley and
Secretary Ben Sherman’s resolu-
tion to approve the budget was
passed unanimously. The only
change in Green‘s figures was a
$525 shift from the Ring-tum Phi
to the Student Body Reserve
Fund. The Phi is spending $1200
less than last year to help balance
the budget.

The EC loaned the Cold Check
Committee $300. Law _ School
Representative Tom King em-
phasized the new money-making
role of the committee, which is
calling students about bad checks
and bringing them before the
Student Control Committee. The
Student Recruitment Committee
was given $300. Committee Chair-
man Gary Avery announced that
one foundation had already re-
newed a three year, $5000 a year
grant.

The Young Americans for Free-
dom requested $2200. They said

NOTICE

Students who have brought
motor vehicles to school must buy
either city or county tags by
October 8. Tags cost $10.00 and
are valid for one year. Any stu-
dent living in the city limits must
buy their tag from the City
Treasurer’s Office on East Wash-
ington. Students whose local resi-
dence is Rockbridge County are
required to purchase a decal from
the County Treasurer’s Office.

Public hearing scheduled

For constitutional changes

A committee of EC representa-
tives has proposed revisions in
several sections of the Student
Body Constitution.

A public hearing on _ these
changes will be held Monday
evening at 6:30 p.m. in the EC
room. The proposed changes will
be posted around the campus
Thursday. If the EC approves
these changes, they will be voted
on by the student body. A sum-
mary of the major changes is
provided below:

Add a new article on elections,
which would change the dates of
elections to conform with the 12-

12-6 calendar and provide that
candidates must receive a ma-
jority of the ballots cast to win
a first primary.

Provide that the adoption of
amendments would require a
two-thirds approval vote in an
election in which at least half of
the student body participated.

Place the President and Vice
President of each class on the
Student Control Board.

Make transfer students
bers of the university
body.

ing trips to Chile (later changed
to California) and Miami (for
conservative Cubans). They em-
phasized that nearby communi-
ties only offered rednecks, which
they said are different from true
conservaties. Sophomore Repre-
sentative Leland McCullough’s
motion to deny the funds was ap-
proved.

In other action the EC an-
nounced Monday that organiza-
tions selling pre-written term
papers are being warned off the
campus. Dave Braun’s request for
a committee to get BankAmeri-

It could be a cold winter in Rockbridge

Student living off-campus and
many residents of Lexington and
Rockbridge County could have a
problem obtaining fuel for heat-
ing this winter.

The big oil companies have told
their distributors that this winter
could bring a real shortage of
fuel oil to Virginia as well as
other parts of the country, ac-
cording to local distributors of
the fuel,

The problem affects not only
present fuel oil customers, but al-
so anyone new in the area who
is not yet a customer of fuel oil

service and is trying to become
one,

City officials estimate that 20
percent of Lexington residents
use fuel oil to heat their homes.
The figure is believed to be much
higher out in the countryside of
Rockbridge County. The problem
is further believed to be acute
for students living off-campus,

Distributors said they are get-
ting allotments of oil which equal
the amount they received last
year. They explained this as the
reason why they are not accept-
ing new customers,

One area fuel oil company has
already shut down, according to
local distributors. About 200 fami-
lies are currently without fuel
supply for the winter in Raphine
due to the closing of the Mines
Oil Co. With few distributors ac-
cepting new customers, the famil-
ies ‘may well be unable to find
any fuel oil this winter to heat
their homes,

Last year
escaped

the Lexington area
with a relatively mild
winter as far as fuel use is con-
cerned. Distributors last spring
reported few problems over the

winter in allocating fuel. The dis-
tributors noted the unusually
warm winter temperatures in ex-
plaining last winter’s fuel situa-
tion locally.

Sunday, White House Counselo:
Melvin Laird said President Nixon
may be forced to implement a
plan this winter for mandatory
allocations of fuel, Laird said a
four-step plan, with the last step
being mandatory allocations, is
being considered for enforcement
by the Executive Branch of the
government, with or without con-
gressional approval,

OUTLOOK and REVIEW
Ripping off the students

Whether intended or not, the city of Lexington is, in the minds
of many persons at Washington and Lee, ripping off the average
student.

Consider the following:

. Automobile tags. Students with motor vehicles registered out
of state are required to have a city or county license tag. The student
is apparently considered a resident of the area and is charged as
such, as are all Virginia residents. Though the city tag fee may and
probably could be challenged as a rip-off solely in itself, this is not
the main point. The classification of the student as an apparent
resident and not just a transient has caused problems in other areas,
specifically:

... Registering to vote. If you are assumed a resident of the area
in registering a motor vehicle, then why has there been such a hassle
in recent years when a student has approached the local voter registra-
tion board in an attempt to assert his privilege of voting? Reportedly,
residency has been at the root of the problem—is a W&L student a
resident and therefore eligible to vote? The city seems to think so
in regard to license tag fees; why not the same for registration to
vote locally and perhaps give the student a voice in the local govern-
ment? Perhaps a little student representation could help give the stu-
dent an even break in the city.

...A one percent tax on food. Lexington is fast becoming known
as somewhat of a tourist trap by some particularly because of this tax,
which certainly hurts tourists—and financially more than it does the
citizens of Lexington. For residents, there is little problem. The tax,
particularly when applied to prepared food such as that in a restau-
rant, or a snack bar, or a Co-op for that matter, poses a constant
burden on those who do not live entirely off their own cooking. Stu-
dents, for instance.

One percent may seem trivial, granted, but it adds up fast. Com-
bined with the state tax, Lexington’s penny tax on he dollar aids
in bringing the cost of a 15 cent ice cream cone to 16 cents.

Besides affecting the pocketbook in a subtle way, the tax is a
downright nuisance. The endless search for the extra penny or two,
or the equally endless wait for your change, is a pain most can do
without. And of course, do the W&L students, who are affected most
by the tax, reap the benefits from it?

... Parking meters in front of fraternity houses. What legitimate
excuse is there for meters in front of, say, the Sigma Chi house? It
is doubtful that the meters are used to any degree by patrons of the
Lexington “business district,” particularly when one considers the
amount of available space downtown.

There are of course, other grips which could be discussed in this
column, perhaps even to the point of alleging a conspiracy by the
towns people against the university. But many of these border on the
line separating legitimate complaint from complete paranoia, and
many are seen by students on an individual basis.

Whatever the case, when one considers the economic impact of the
Washington and Lee student upon this community, both economically
and intellectually, it seems as if somebody is on the short end of the
stick.

This view may be biased, granted, but it is the biased view of
students whose patiences and pocketbooks have both been taxed by
the city. The student is getting ripped off, perhaps in a figurative
sense, possibly in a literal sense. —P.J.L.

Responding to student needs

A proposal asking for equal representation (6-6) of students and
faculty on the Courses and Degrees Committee will be brought before
the University Council today and the genral faculty on Monday.

Currently, the board has one student and eight members of the
faculty and administration. The committee is involved primarily
with policy in regards to couses at Washington and Lee.

Why even up the representation? First, the move will make the
committee more responsive to student needs. Six students on the
committee can give a better representation of students wants and
needs than can one.

Second, the move will enhance the role of the committee as middle
ground between students and faculty. It would be a true link be-
tween the Curriculum Committee, comprised of students, on the lower
end of the ladder, and the faculty committee at the top. The faculty
would still have final say in any curriculum matters.

We emphatically endorse the proposal, as did the Executive Com-
mittee (which did so in a unanimous vote). The move will not decrease
the faculty’s ultimate power in course decisions, and it will aid in
expanding the marketplace of ideas in curriculum matters high up
the ladder, so that all sides of the issue can be presented in the now
one-sided environment of executive decisions. —P.J.L.

‘Who had the English muffins?”

ETTERS TO THE CL

Sir:

This letter is addressed to the
Student Activities Board and the
Contact Committee.

This past Wednesday night, a
program of unquestionable merit
was brought by your board to
the W&L campus. The program
dealing with the assassination of
President John Kennedy was of
great interest to the student body.

However, did your committees
not realize that September 26
(Wednesday night) was the first
night of the Jewish New Year.
This holiday is among the most
religious occasions observed by
the Jewish Community and, there-
fore, had you known about the
holiday, I feel your committees
are guilty of not considering the
interests of the Jewish students
on campus,

Should your committees not
have known about the Jewish
holiday, I suggest you get a new
calendar and keep more abreast
of activities that will keep stu-
dents in the W&L community
from being able to participate in
activities they pay for from the
student tax.

‘The Devils’ to show Friday

IXen Russell’s “The Devils” will
be presented in duPont Auditor-
ium Friday and Saturday at 7
p.m. with an admission charge of
7o cents, The film is a true story,
carefully documented, historically
acurate—a serious work by one
of the cinema’s’ outstanding
talents.

 

“The Devils” is, to say the least,
a controversial film. It is being
hailed by many as a masterpiece.
Others have found it visually
shocking and deeply disturbing

it is rather explicit in depicting
that

the bizarre events occurred

in France in 1643.

 

HIGH

LUSTER

Vanessa Redgrave plays the
hunchbacked Mother Superior of
a convent who becomes sexually
obsessed with a worldly priest,
played by Oliver Reed. In her
frustration, she falsely accuses
him of lewdness and sorcery. Her
accusation leads to a mass public
exorcism, instigated by Cardinal
Richelieu. The priest is found
guilty and burned at the stake.

Russell’s screenplay for “The
Devils” is based on Aldous Hux-
ley’s “The Devils of Loudun” and
“The Devils,’ a play by John
Whiting.

Rumors are floating around
that Loggins and Messina are on
the University of Virginia con-
cert agenda. If they are, look out.
The Messina group is not one to
miss.

A group best known on top 40
radio for “Your Mama _ Don’t
Dance and Your Daddy Don’t
Rock and Roll,” Kenny Loggins,
Jim Messina and company are
one of the finest feeling music
machines to come out of Los
Angeles in some time.

Listened to and talked about
often on the mid to northern East
Coast, the band has been neg-
lected by radio audiences in the
South and Midwest. To find out
how they felt about their seem-
ing lack of popularity in these
areas of the country, this critic
went backstage after one of Log-
gins and Messina’s concerts for
an interview that turned out to
be a session resembling a meet-
ing of old friends.

Messina did most of the talk-
ing even though Loggins is a
talkative guy. “We’re not really
concerned about the popularity
question even though we don’t
understand it,’ Messina said.
“We've done well on the West
coast, especially L.A., but most
of our stuff has been better re-
ceived in the South when some
other artist did it.”

He was referring to the success
of Ann Murray’s version of “Dan-
ny’s Song” and the Nitty Gritty
Dirt Band’s rendition of ‘‘House
at Pooh Corner.”

Loggins, who wrote both of the
songs, said it did not really
bother him. “In fact, I cry all
the way to the bank.”

After all this critic had heard
about Messina as a member of
the Buffalo Springfield and Poco
and, never having heard of Log-
gins before he began with Mes-

sina, the question of group origin
came up.

“Jim was producing records,
and I needed a producer. A friend
of mine talked to him and told
Jim I would call him about doing
some production work for me.
I did call him and we got to-
gether,” said Loggins.

Messina said he had left Poco
because the group’s music was
starting to take a direction away
from his musical intention. When
he and Loggins met they found
they could combine interests to
fulfill the same intention.

They still compose primarily
apart from each other but com-
bine creative purposes through
arrangements,

“We see each song as a separate
entity,” Messina said, “Like with
‘Your Mama Don’t Dance,’ it’s a
novelty tune, not an extension of
our aesthetic premise.”

The touring group is made up
of Al Garth of saxophones, re-
corders and violin; Jon Clarke on
saxophone and flute; Larry Sims

on bass; Merel Bregante play
drums.
Michael Omartian plays key-

boards on both of the group’s
albums but does not tour with
the band.

Loggins and Messina create a
musical experience that is rarely

Book reviews

By ROME SCOTT
THE FIFTH ESTATE by Robin
Moore (Doubleday, $7.95).

A four-year effort on the part of
the autnor of the “French Con.
nection,” this novel is an interest
grabber.

Moore stays within his chosen
orientation, dealing with crime,
again handling the subject with
the vivid style that made “Con.
nection” such a successful movie
script.

Brad Kendall is a dynamic,
highly respected businessman in
hotel management with the Ascot
Hotel chain when the hotels are
sold to the Whitehall corporation.

Whitehall has a nebulous but
respected history in the financial
realm and is the subject of much
speculation, many saying the
corporation is connected with
organized crime,

Only after he decides to work
for Whitehall as president of
Ascot Hotels does Kendall find
that the speculation is not idle
and he has become involved in
the fifth estate—the court of the
king of organized crime.

The story deals in fiction so
Closely tied to non-fiction that
one wonders throughout the book
how much of the truth is in-
volved.

A postscript to the novel could
read—“Only the names have been

changed to protect the gsuillty.”

Note: The views expressed in
this column do not necessarily
reflect those of the Phi.—Editor

During Freshman  matricula-
tion, numerous pieces of literature
which were thrust into each
ingenuous freshman’s hand, in-
cluding some very timely informa-
tion on abortion. A stout little
man, while feverishly passing out
his infantium corpora delecti ex-
pose, was excitedly chattering
about how “the abortion issue”
would tear this country apart be-
cause of the controversy it will
generate. In certain quarters of
the Freshman Class the contro-
versy has already begun.

Although it is estimated that
there are over one million abor-
tions performed in the United
States and Canada annually, there
is great disagreement over the
jegality and morality of obrtion.

Even in the Catholic Church,
whose upper hirarchy solemnly
denounces abortion and contracep-
tion with equal lassitude, there
is a great division of opinion on
this topic. Paul W. Rahmier, emi-
nent Catholic clergyman, has
taken the liberal side of the argu-
ment in an article entitled “Abor-
tion and the Reverence for Life”
(Christian Century): that the
fetus, although possessing the
capacity for becoming a human
being, is not a human being who
can be protected by the courts,
as if it had human rights, Futher-
more, Mr. Rahmier insists that a
woman should not have to bear
a child which might endanger her
health.

On the other side, Robert H.
Hamill, also an eminent Catholic
clergyman-spokesman, insists that
abortion is wrong for any reason
whatsoever. He counters Mr.
Rahmier’s claim of social benefits
from abortion by noting that it
is a “patent misreading of human
nature.” He goes on to state that

Abortion

    

women who know they have a
“way out” will be less inclined
toward careful contraceptive plan-
ning.
Both

these views express a
common goal—reverence for hu-
man life. Yet, not only are their
means of achieving this reverence
irreconcilable, but both men are
looking at the problem in the
wrong perspective.

Abortion of the fetus is not
morally wrong because it causes
the destruction of a human life.
It is morally wrong because it
violates a life brought into exist-
ence by human coitus, which
under God’s law is a holy union
to be practiced in the bonds of
matrimony. The life brought
about is therefore a gift of God
in whatever stage one examines
it. Abortion does indeed give an
easy out to those who wish to
be sexually promiscuous, but who
simultaneously do not want any
of the responsibilities of sexual
intercourse,

Sexual intercourse is not
merely for the gratification of the
human sexual appetite. In fact,
this is the least important func-
tion of sex. Sex is a gift of God
to be enjoyed as He directs, with-
in the bonds of marriage as an
expression of love and to produce
children. Sexual gratification as
a physical, emotional, or psycho-
logical necessity must be viewed
as only secondary to these pri-
mary purposes.

The controversy over abortion
cannot be resolved in an explana-
tion of the true purposes of sex.
Unfortunately, there are many
people in our country and our
world who are willing to tune
out their sense of moral rectitude
and tune in moral degeneracy.
For such people, the law must be
used as a restraint, lest we all
be consumed in their libidinous
irresponsibility.

Ask Traveler

Advice of a different color

Q—How does one do well with women?

A—From my vantage point outside Lee Chapel over the years, I’ve
seen hundreds of felines floating along under the hypnotic spell
of quite ordinary W&L men, not unlike yourself, I imagine. Ex-
cept for one terrible girl from Vermont last week who made
some rather rude remarks to me about rusty nails and saddle
sores, most of those females have certain romantic traits in com-
mon. Once you learn to identify them, you'll be able to face off
and hip-check on Saturday night for the big score! But remember
lacrosse isn’t the only weekend sport where one can incure nasty
penalties.

First of all, girls enjoy being the center of attention. So the
next time you have to slap your date around for spilling her drink
all over your new flares, make sure everyone in sight is watch-
ing. Secondly, girls appreciate the well-dressed guy. The clothes
a man wears indirectly reflects his feelings towards the woman
he is with. So, unless your date is a female Charlie tuna, stay
away from denim overalls and those Mail Pouch sunvisors.

Q—You’re kidding me, aren’t you?

A—Heaven, no! Remember, a woman, like a cat, possesses an insati-
able curiosity for abnormality in men. Even character quirks,
such as wearing argyle socks on your ears, attracts women in
no uncertain manner. So if a girl treats you like an overdue
library book, don’t think that you're shelved for good. Cultivate
vour bad habits. Use your imagination! If you don’t have any
birth defects, buy a Halloween mask for mixers. Remember,
there’s no greater compliment than being called the Mad Hatter
in romance; at least HE went to parties!

Mays’ love affair ends

By BILL AUSTIN
Sports Editor

Willie Mays announced his re-
tirement last Thursday, choosing
a day that belonged to a couple
of aging tennis players and to
curious hordes that endlessly de-
bated the male-female confronta-
tion. Sadly enough, the poor tim-
ing reflected all too truly the
season’s woes for the Met center
fielder. Injuries humbled _ the
once flawless ballplayer in a man-
ner that proved painful to ob-
serve. Like the Yankee great,
Mantle, to whom he was often
compared—with many resulting
arguments—the end for Mays has
been an experience in frustration.
Thankfully, Mays’ undeniable ac-
complishments, deeds that span
a period of 22 summers (his 660
home runs, .307 Batting Average),
salve the hurt of 1973’s .211 B.A.
and 6 HRs. Indeed, they should.

Mays was trapped in what he
chose to call “a love affair” with
baseball, making any decision to
retire a matter of inestimable
difficulty. Then too, New York
was once again the theatre for
his efforts, the pulse-beat of Mays-
fanaticism that never quite died
after his years of skillfulness with
the old New York Giants.

For some, Mays always seemed
to garner more than his share
of adulation, sapping the amount
of acclaim to be doled out to
other stars of similar achieve-
ment, like Aaron or Clemente.
Possibly his seasons in the media-
center contributed a great deal,
but there were other factors,
deeper and more telling, which
touched the vital core of what
makes a performer the image of
greatness.

Mays lived baseball, to a de-
gree that is frightening to
examine. He gave his soul to a
game; consequently, the totality
of effort consumed him, Every
September, after five months of
day-to-day struggle, Mays would
succumb to physical exhaustion
and batting slumps, simply be-
cause he had given all there was
to give. His personal affairs were
also battered by this ruthless
dedication: divorce, financial mis-

judgment, haunted him while he

immersed himself in the little-bay
dreams of the baseball myth. For
the effort, he became a part of
that myth scheme, a figure for
the young and dream-prone to
emulate.

This season, the myth showed
obvious signs of wear, in Mays’
performance and attitude. He
balked at retiring after a rough
spring, but the rumors of an
ending persisted when his play-
ing time declined along with his
batting average. Others on the
Met team apparently resented the
special treatment granted its high-
est paid member; even Yogi Berra
seemed bothered with the task of
inserting Mays into his line-up.
Over the summer, he became a
curiously forgotten ball player,
appearing briefly in mid-July to
strike out in the Kansas City All-
Star affair. His troubles were
magnified in the case of the
Mets, a team of injury and weak
hitting. Through much of July
and August, they played the role
of cellar-dwellers in the NL east,
and played it well.

Then, with the division race
caught in the throes of uncer-
tainty, the Mets reformed. For
the past four weeks, they have
parlayed outstanding pitching
and timely hitting into a real shot
at play-off money, and presently
contend for the National League
eastern title.

All this sets the stage for high
drama, an opportunity for reality
to steal a page from fiction. Mays
seeks a way to go out as a player,
and in no finer fashion could he
leave the game than as a pennant-
clinching pinch-hitter in the ninth
inning of tight contest. Maybe
fate, in its own subtle way, will
repay number 24 for the cruelties
with which it has heavily burda-
ened him in this, his final year.
Such is a true test for the magic
of the myth, and for its favorite
son, Willie Mays.

W&L Cross Country—a preview

By STEVE BAKER
“Okay boys, let’s go. And I just
want you to keep this in mind as
you run: it can’t hurt forever.”

Armed with such comforting
philosophy, the cross-country

team, some 30 strong, begins what
shall be an 8-mile workout. Left
behind in a slowly settling cloud
of dust and gravel stands Coach
Dick Miller, looking very coach-
like with his clipboard, whistle
and stopwatch.

Leading the pack are Senior co-
captain Bill Kalal, and sophomores
Mike Burns, Tom Washington

and Jim McMenamin. In this
group lies the bulk of the team’s
scoring power; these runners are
expected to consistently fill four
of five scoring positions. And they
will fill them well indeed, from
the looks of their prepatory work-
outs: every other day, an 8-mile
“general conditioning” workout,
interspersed on the odd days by
grueling speed work, reputedly
the hardest workouts W&L run-
ners have seen in some time.
Prospects for a successful sea
son look reasonably good, though

W&L Demoralizes

Hamilton,

By BILL FLESHER

Lewis Powell passed and ran
for over 250 yards Saturday as
the Washington and Lee Generals
opened their 1973 football season
with a 29-7 win over Hamilton
College.

The senior quarterback hit 13
of 25 passes for 191 yards, includ-
ing a 63-yard touchdown strike to
freshman tight end Tony Perry.
Powell also led the team in rush-
ing, gaining 70 yards and a touch-
down in 17 carriers.

In its first game under new
head coach Bill McHenry, W&L
looked much impoved over last
year’s squad, which managed only
three wins in nine outings. On
Saturday, the offense picked up
a95 total—yards—tand 28 first
downs), while the defensive unit,
led by co-captain Bill Wallace,
allowed only one touchdown, fore-
ing the Continentals to go to the
air much more than they wanted.

W&L got on the board first, as
senior fullback Jim Farrar cap-
ped a 67-yard drive with a one-
vard plunge. Powell ran for a

Soccer team anticipates good year,

By PAUL CAVALIERRE, JR.

The 1973-74 version of the
Washington and Lee soccer team,
captained by Rolf Piranian and
Bill Spoffard, opens its season
against Eastern Mennonite this
Saturday. Game time is 10:15 a.m.
by the Liberty Hall ruins at the
upper field.

The Generals have 14 return-
ing lettermen and a good crop of

freshmen this year. The lineup
is headed by Jim Fox, the second
leading scorer in the state last
year. Helping him on the front
line are John Embre, Spoffard,
freshman Doug Hunter, and
Kenyan exchange student Harry
Jembe. The halfback line is
anchored by veterans Chuck
Alexander, Bobby Crawford,

Lecky Stone and freshman John
Monherbeck.

two-point conversion after a bad
snap, and the Generals led 8-0.

W&L blew a potential scoring
drive early in the second quarter
when Powell fumbled inside the
Hamilton 15. Later in the quarter,
the Continentals got their only
touchdown of the day as they
went 69 yards in 13 plays. Quart-
erback Rob Winter hit Dave
Baker with a three-yard scoring
pass, Bill Finan kicked the extra
point, and W&L led by 8-7 at
the half.

W&L took the second half kick-
off and marched 73 yards in 12
plays. The big play of the drive
came on a fourth-and-one situa-
tion, when Powell ran a bootleg
for 18 yards. Two plays later, he
went the other way for the score.
Perry’s kick was good.

After a Hamilton field goal at-
tempt failed, the Generals moved
further ahead. On the fourth play
of the drive, Powell looked long
for Perry. The ball was under-
thrown, and looked to be in the
hands of the Hamilton defender.

Galyon, Barclay Armstrong and

The season schedule is high-

ticed since September 6 and
should provide plenty of com-
petition for all of their opponents.
Already the Generals have beaten

Generals win

(Continued from page 7)
But Perry “intercepted” the ball,
avoided two tacklers, and went
the rest of the way for the TD.
The PAT failed, but the Generals
had established a 21-7 lead.

The final touchdown drive start-
ed when Rick Kulp recovered a
Lou Cordia fumble at the W&L
45. The Generals took 12 plays
to score, with Bob Lindsey going
the final yard. Freshman Rocky
Joyner goth the two-point con-
version in the same _ fashion
Powell had scored on earlier to
close out the scoring.

Hamilton’s hopes were extin-
guished on the ensuing drive,
when Wallace picked off a Winter
pass at the W&L 13. McHenry
then cleared the bench, as just
about everyone saw action.

With one win under their belts,
the Generals stay at home this
week to entertain Centre College.
Wé&L hasn’t beaten Centre since
1967. The Colonels won last year’s
meeting of the two teams, 15-14,
at Danville, Ky. The Generals
blew a 14-0 lead in that one, and
seemed to “hang it up” for the
season after the loss.

(Continued from page 6)
Coach Miller could not be coerced
into making official predictions.

Looking ahead at the season...
Stu Nibley’s hampering injuries
will similarly hamper the team’s
performance. Stu was depended
on to fill one of the top five fnish-
ing spots. As a result, the pres-
sure to finish well has fallen
heavily on three freshmen of
promise: Kirk Ruffin, Austin Ball,
and Jess O’Neil. They are accept-
ing the task and competing with
a vigor that evokes no small
measure of respect. Perhaps the
prodding and home-spun _ philoso-
phy of Coach Miller can get them
ready for tAcir first meet of
October 6th.
