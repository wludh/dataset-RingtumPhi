What price honor?

In light of last week’s public honor trial, the Honor System
has finally become a topic of interest around here. And now
that interest has been aroused, we would like to address our-
selves to the question of honor at Washington and Lee.

One note: this column in no way reflects on last week’s
decision. We affirm the defendant’s innocence as decided by
the jury. The trial did arouse this campus to seriously look
at the question of honor; we subsequently are looking at that
issue—and not at the trial—in this column.

Where has honor gone?

Well over half the students surveyed in a recent question-
naire said they don’t agree with retaining the absolute pen-
alty—expulsion from Washington and Lee—as the punish-
ment for a breach of honor. Over one-third said they knew
of honor violations on campus but they didn’t report them.

More than half felt there was a reluctance to report honor
violations because of the absolute penalty. And three out of
every five surveyed said there would be less inhibition over
reporting an honor violation if the absolute penalty were not
the only punishment for guilt.

Consider a hypothetical pubic honor trial jury—12 stu-
dents. Now, if they anywhere represented the same sampl-
ing of students questioned in the Honor System survey,
seven would disagree with retaining the absolute penalty as
the punishment for honor violations.

On that 12-man jury, five votes in favor of the defendant’s
innocence constitutes acquittal.

How, then, could anyone ever be convicted in a public
honor trial if more than half the jury doesn’t even believe
in the way the Honor System works, assuming the jury
accurately represents the student body?

Is it better to retain the old system in the name of honor
if that system is so prostituted that, as the crux of the whole
Honor System philosophy, honor is replaced by the unwilling-
ness of the students to administer the absolute penalty?

One of the virtues of Washington and Lee, or so the
blurbs in the college profile books say, is its student-run Honor
System. That is doubtful.

Because under the Washington and Lee student-run Honor
System, honor is dying. Just ask the students.

Yet, it still can rise out of the ashes of mediocrity of our
current Honor System. Honor, for what little it seems to be
worth at this time, can still be saved.

Change the penalty. Add a year’s suspension as a possible
penalty. Don’t indicate on the student’s transcript that he
was kicked out because of an honor violation. Do something;
but above all, save honor.

We ask the help of the Executive Committee of the student
body and of the Board of Trustees. They hold the power to
save Washington and Lee’s honor. The EC must show the
Board what the students really think about honor. The EC
must show the Board that honor is dying at Washington
and Lee. And the Board in turn must save honor by altering
the absolute penalty.

What price honor?

RO UU Che 7

On the honor trial

Sir:

I am certain that by this time
vou have been besieged with com-
ments of one form or another
concerning the recent honor trial.
This action and the U.Va. lacrosse
game seem to have been the only
incidents that have attracted stu-
dent interest thus far this year.
As a freshman I was greatly in-
terested in this, my first public
honor trial. If I may, I would
like to add my opinions to any
others that you may have re-
ceived.

The one reason, more than any
other, that I decided to come to
this university is the existence of
the Washington and Lee Honor
Code. I was told by people that
the Honor System at W&L really
worked, that honor among men
was a daily practice at this uni-
versity and not some idealized
abstraction. I wanted to be a
part of a tradition where intel-
lectual integrity is of primary
importance. I am disillusioned.

If labels must affixed, I con-
sider myself to be neither con-
servative nor chauvinistic. I am
merely a man who has come to
love this institution and the prin-
cipals on which it was founded.
It may not be in vogue to feel
this way, but I do and offer no
excuses. And I experienced a
great personal insult that Mon-
day evening when Mr. Murray,
the foreman of the honor jury,
had the audacity to tell me that
honor is a nebulous thing. And
because of this, the defendant
could not be found guilty of com-
mitting over 40 instances of plagi-
arism. I fear for the future of
this school. If our Honor System
is undermined, Washington and
Lee will only be exceptional on
the lacrosse field.

I feel no ire against the de-
fendant. The defendant willingly
admitted that he had plagiarized,
but the jury did not seem to
think that this was sufficient for
a conviction. The “intent” behind
the dishonorable act became the
basis for guilt. At this point a
clear breach of the Honor Code
was polluted as a myriad of
“character” witnesses testifield
on the defendant’s behalf. There
is no question in my mind that
the defendant seems to be a re-
spectable fellow. But this fact
should have no bearing on an
honor decision. For the Honor
Code to work, for the survival of
independent exams, for the exist-
ene of this university, an honor
penalty must be absolute.

The trouble seems to lie in the
appeals setup of the Honor Sys-

tem. A public honor trial is not.

a reliable method for upholding
the Honor Code. The record will
show that student juries have
made incredible acquittals in the
past. Twelve inexperienced,
“randomly” selected students can-
not, apparently, rule objectively
on a question of dishonor. They
are placed up on a stage in front
of their peers and lose the cour-
age and conviction needed to im-

plement the absolute penalty.

It is easy to talk about one’s
belief in the Honor Code, but
when it gets right down to it,
when all of the “dirt” of an honor
decision is released from the EC
room and put in the hands of the
students, they fail miserably. If
belief in our Honor Code cannot
be backed up with appropriate
actions, I would rather see the
Code dropped than subjected to
the hypocritical support it is now
receiving.

Sincerely,
Richard 8. Wolf, ’77
Editor's note: No, as usual we
haven't been besieged with
comments concerning the honor
trial. But then, we’re beginning
to think apathy is a _ prere-
quisite for getting into this uni-
versity.

Saving honor at W&L

Sir:

It is readily apparent to me
that the Honor System at Wash-
ington and Lee is in need of some
careful revision. Recent events
have influenced my previously
conservative views towards the
sentence to be imposed upon con-
viction of a student at a public
hearing.

No one likes to think of a stu-
dent being asked to leave Wash-
ington and Lee, regardless of
whether or not his transcript
indicates that he is leaving due
to an Honor Violation conviction.
However, it is my position that
transferring to another college
(upon conviction by the Execu-
tive Committee) is just not that
big a deal. I recognize the fact
that a convicted student who de-
cides to transfer to another col-
lege may be leaving the best
friends he has ever had, and I
personally consider it a great
privilege to be a student at
W&L. However, it is also neces-
sary to recognize the number of
voluntary transferrals in and out
of W&L and other colleges that
are taking place nowadays.

It is my proposal that a con-
viction at a public hearing should
not be distinguished from an Ex-
ecutive Committee conviction; no
indication of an Honor Violation
should be made on the transcript
of a student who has been con-
victed at a public hearing.

I would like to strongly em-
phasize the drastic difference be-
tween a legitimate transferral to
another college and the intensely
serious situation of indicating up-
on a convicted student’s tran-
script that he is leaving due to
an Honor Violation.

In most cases of the past four
years, public hearings have de-

‘termined that the accusations

have not been of a nature serious
enough to merit a permanent
mark upon the record of the ac-
cused student; but in each case,
as we well know, the Executive
Committee has ruled that every
given offense was serious enough
to ask the accused student to
make a legitimate transferral to

another college.

In conclusion, I would like to
state that I have no axe to grind
against anyone, and of course, I
accept all decisions involving
Honor Violations as final and
valid. Personally, I would con-
sider a one year dismissal to be
too lenient a sentence for an
Honor Violation, and I oppose
any Honor System changes other
than the one proposed in this
letter.

Respectfully,
An Ex-Juror

Tenure at W&L
Sir:

Let me reflect on the nature
of tenure for a short space.

What does it do for the stu-
dents at W&L?

Tenure guarantees that talent-
ed faculty remain at the univer-
sity to pass on their knowledge
to the students.

Those more knowledgable of
the subtleties of tenure can en-
lighten us on the further advant-
ages of tenure to the students.

What does tenure do against
the interest of the students?

In psychology, I took four
courses, never got a note out of
class lectures and was tested on
the footnotes out of the text. They
almost had me convinced that I
was actually stupid.

In journalism, I listened to pro-
fessors reading verbatim from
note cards obviously made many
vear's earlier. Raise your hand?
Not in there. They don’t answer
vou.

In sociology, I didn’t have to
take notes in one class because
the teacher used the same notes
in a course that I had taken previ-
ously.

Now I see one of my most re-
spected teachers, one I learned
a lot from because of active
participation on his part, elimi-
nated on the judgment of tenured
faculty and administration mem-
bers.

Is this right that the university
is for the faculty and not for
the students?

Bloomfield College in New Jer-
sey thinks that their university is
for the students. They do not
retard educational progress and
innovation. They are presently
raising massive funds to support
a court battle AGAINST tenure.

Think about it.

Please do not publish my name
as the position of some _ non-
tenured faculty may be jeopar-
dized.

(Name withheld by request)

Do’s, don’t’s for SAB

Sir:

There are two lessons next
year’s Student Activities Board
ean learn from a review of the
work this year’s SAB has done.
One is a do, the other a don’t.

First, I hope the future mem-
bers of the SAB were around for
Fancy Dress Weekend and the

past weekend. Fancy Dress was
definitely the best social event
I’ve ever attended at Washington
and Lee, outside the recent W&L-
U.Va. lacrosse game. Next year
I'll be looking forward to another
big ball.

There was only one blemish, as
I recall, on the entire Fancy Dress
affair this year. That was the
lack of warning given the stu-
dents. Next year’s SBA should
make a mental note not to spring
another surprise on us.

The recent Spring Weekend
also suffered from lack of pub-
licity. Many of us didn’t know
anything had been planned for
last weekend till we picked up
Thursday’s Phi. Even then a will-
ing but unwary participater could
have easily missed Daddy Rab-
bit’s concert Friday afternoon—
the best event of the two days.
The information given to the Phi
did not mention Daddy Rabbit’s
concert and failed to give the
time of the dance Saturday night.

Next year the SBA should give
us a calendar of social events at
the beginning of the year, or at
the beginning of each semester,
and then remind us forgetful
ones well ahead of time through
the use of the Phi and posters.

So, next year let’s have another
Fancy Dress Ball in the style
rejurvenated by this year’s SBA;
let’s have any other events the
new SBA can think of; and let’s
have some advance knowledge of
what’s in store for us.

Looking forward to next year,
Robert Cook, ’75

Ask Traveller

 

Q—Has the spring-term dig around Liberty Hall unearthed anything
exciting than Rupert Latture’s matching ODK cuff-links?

A—Well, frankly no. In the most innocuous archeological undertak-
ing since King Tut’s tomb was sprayed for bagworms in 1924,
Professor John McDaniel and his class of student silt-shovelers
have transformed the Liberty Hall area into another Barger
open-pit mine. Their hopeful goal is to uncover relics from the
past, (preferably before 1969), and determine from a scholarly
study of these relics whether or not Liberty Hall Academy was
non-sectarian and, if so, who said the blessing at lunch.

“You never know what'll turn up next,” says Prof. McDaniel,
after last week’s preliminary digging, “but so far it’s usually a
Schlitz.” McDaniel, an alumnus of W&L who once attempted to
dig to China and collect social security at the same time, reports
three distinct layers at the dig site, each covering approximately
50 years of time. The first layer seems to contain beer-cans and
dirt, the second also beer-cans and dirt, and the third layer,
dating back to 1790, mostly just beer-cans. Nevertheless, Prof.
McDaniel seemed pleased with the excavation’s rseults so far and
expressed hope for more colorful finds, such as “a coin, a fork,
and old jock, or ideally, $100,000 in ready cash so that I can
quit this stupid digging and start living in style.”

The current archeological project may serve to verify several
old legends concerning the Liberty Hall ruins and to explain fully
how the Hall managed to catch fire and burn down in a blinding
rainstorm. Last weeks’ unearthing of a Smokey Burgess baseball
card under three feet of ground lends credence to the idea that
Liberty Hall wasn’t an educational academy at all but, rather,
a farm club of the Pittsburg Pirates. “Why the team failed we
don’t know yet,” explains McDaniel, “but by the number of
called third strikes we’ve discovered, it’s pretty obvious they

weren’t pennant contenders.”

Pains are being taken to authenticate every item unearthed
to avoid future embarrassment, as happened with the infamous
Piltdown man in England, who was later arrested for impersonat-
ing Prince Albert’s stepbrother—Freddie. “Of course, Liberty
Hall is no Stonehenge, but for three credits, the druids would

have cost extra.”

of Clive Stevens

THE EMERGENCE OF
CLIVE STEVENS

Atmospheres
Clive Stevens & friends
Capitol ST 11263

Capitol is not a jazz-oriented
label, especially when it comes
to American musicians. The last
good jazz they picked up was
“IF” an English group, in late
1969. Clive Stevens, also from
England, is their best find so
far for the 1970's, and whoever
comes along to outdo him will
have a lot of hard work ahead.

His sound is an often comfort-
able high-powered blend of tenor
or soprano sax, electric piano,
electric guitar, and plenty of
rhythm, It somewhat resembles a
cross-breeding for Weather Re-
port and the Winter Consort;
Stevens’ composing is suitably
loose for a full-band sound.

He wisely recorded the album
in New York, where he had the
world’s best choice of excellent
musicians for his sessions. Billy
Cobham and Rick Laird, form-
erly (?) of the Mahavishnu
Orchestra, provide the framework
on drums and bass with their
usual wizardries, contributing an

enlightened kind of intellectual
funkiness. Ralph Towner, of
Oregon, puts in his chops on the
keyboard instead of guitar this
time. Combining influences of
Corea and Zawinul with his own
multiplicity of styles, Towner
again proves his ability to lead
and support a band equally well.
John Abercrombie, whose guitar
has been an essential element in
the music of Gato Barbieri and
Dreams, lets it fly again, Sticking
mostly to the higher registers,
“Crumbles” comes off like John
McLaughlin might if he were
ever relaxed when he played. His
chordings are much more smooth-
ed out than Mahavishnu, and tend
to elevate the music without push-
ing it through your skull.

Particularly nice are “Astral
Dreams” and “All Day Next
Week.” Atmospheres, even on the
merit of those two songs alone, is
the best instrumental album so
far for 1974 in the field of
electrified music. If Stevens can
assemble as good a full-time band
as he got together for these ses-
sions, he’ll go a long way. Even
if he should continue doing ses-
sion-band albums, as Gato Bar-
bieri did for several years, they’l!l
be well worth repeated listenings.

With this debut album, Stevens
has put himself in a class with

the best. And Atmospheres makes
me think he’s got what it takes
to stay there.

Airto & Deodato

The title of this album is some-
what misleading, for it has noth-
ing to do with the teevee show of
the same name, and Airto and
Deodato are not playing together;
they merely happened to be shar-
ing the billing at New York’s
Felt Forum the night this album
was taped. Airto and his band
“Fingers” come across well, as
good Latino bands tend to do
for live music. His drumming, the
best to be heard these days, pro-
vides guidepoints for the other
players, who let rock influences
color their Brazilian origins.
From the sound of their cuts on
this album, “Fingers” seem to
have the ability to become a very
high-energy environment in a con-
cert situation, rather like the
Grateful Dead could in their
prime. (Anthem of the Sun.)

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Superstar Al F

Compiled from various
eyewitness accounts

Al Black came back.

There were warnings of course.
Clues here and there around cam-
pus asking the inevitable: who is
A] Black? But few thought that
the man himself would return to
his alma mater for a return en-
gagement of Al Black Day.

Al, merely an anonymous non-
entity to this year’s freshmen be-
fore his appearance here Tuesday,
brought back with him the
“charisma,” for lack of a better
word, to win over the hearts and
voices of the Washington and Lee
student body once again.

For a historical overview, the
Phi dug deeply into its archives
Tuesday night in an effort to
explain the Al Blackism phe-
nomenon which infects’ the
campus once a year—the first
day of May, concurrent with the
Soviet May Day celebrations. But
little explanation could be found.

Al] Black, not unlike an un-
wanted pregnancy, just “happen-
ed.” And he happened so infam-
ously last year, a day was set
aside in his honor for this year.
That day was well-received.

With a few minor exceptions,
this year’s celebrations followed
those of last year in form and
manner. Eyewitness reports re-
construct the following tale:

The beer began flowing in the
freshman quad late Monday
night. Soon after, Al made his
appearance. Scattered reports
filtered in prior to his appear-
ance, telling disbelievers that, yes,
Al was truly back. Reports indi-
cate Al’s appearance was too
much for some, causing swoon-
ing and fainting even among the
stout-hearted of W&L gentlemen.
Some thought he was a vision
conjured up by earlier rumors
and too much brew. But it was
Al.

Hell broke loose. The freshmen,
before this not quite sure what
they should be doing to celebrate
Flounder’s Day, were carried up
by the spirit of the occasion as
Al entered the quad. And last
year’s ritual was repeated Tues-
day night.

A quick speech. Then the cheer-
ing squadron belched out of the
quad toward the thriving busi-
ness district of the Big Lex. A
rally was held at the Post Office;
then, cheers of “On to VMI” sent
the forces, now some 300 or more
strong, spilling toward the mili-
tary institute.

Once there, the ardent support-
ers of W&L’s most celebrated non-
entity found police waiting as
they plotted to storm the gates.
The VeeMees, aroused from their
barrack bunks by the ever-louder
chants of “Al Black” as the crowd
approached, joined in the celebra-
tion, but the W&L contingent
could not penetrate the gates of
VMI.

One more attempt to enter the
gates was made, using such di-
versionary tactics as the dumping
of a garbage can full of water on
one of the policemen (this, by a
VeeMee), but the attack failed.

The crowd reversed field and
rolled back toward the Washing-
ton and Lee campus. Several
times along the way the crowd
stopped to hear its hero speak.
The throng even carried A] into
a Tucker Hall lecture room for a
few words of worldly wisdom.

Then on down the Colonnade
Wes»

President Huntley’s house. In
much the same manner as last
year, the power-mad, or just mad,
crowd made its way to the porch
of the house where General Lee
lived during his presidency of
then—Washington College. The
students stomped, screamed,
chanted for presidential acknow)-

acknowledgement came.

President Huntley emerged
from his house, disdaining his
traditional suit-and-tie combina-

to the occasion. No, he was not

He spoke kindly of Al, welcom-
ing the celebrated alumnus back
for a visit to the campus. The
students demanded more. “Can

“Of course,” Huntley reportedly

As quickly as they had piled

vocal support when we were be-

definitely helped us come hack to
win,

their leisure. Informality will be

The 1974 season could very well
be the greatest in W&L lacrosse
history. The next few regular sea-
son games will be very challeng-

know vou're behind us. It could
make the difference.

overtime thriller
State won’t be found in the offic-
ial scorebook.

It came from three fans who,
when the Generals fell behind
late in regulation play, left the
bleachers at Wilson Field and be-
came the first cheerleaders W&L
has had in several years.

Though a bit unorthodox in
their ways or arousing the fans,
the three, freshmen Woody
Wooddell and Bill Beauchamp
and sophomore Rick Bates, pro-
vided the spark which brought
the crowd to its feet for the en-
tire final period and the two over-
time stanzas.

Wooddell said after the game
that the trio launched into action
because “things were too quiet
in the stands.

“It reminded me of high
school,” Wooddell said. “We got
behind, and it seemed as if every-
body was just going to give up.
[ knew the players were still
fighting to win, so why shouldn’t
the fans be doing the same thing.”

W&L head coach Jack Emmer
called the fans a key to the
Generals’ fourth quarter rally.

“Our fans really got behind us
when we were behind,” Emmer
said.

“They’ve never helped us out
this much in the two years that
I’ve been here,” he added.

The players also appreciated
the support of the fans as well
as efforts of the cheerleading
trio.

One player remarked, “I’ve
seen much better looking cheer-
leaders but I’ve never seen any-

one get fans going like those
three did.”

WAL fights off Towson State

By BILL FLESHER

Washington and Lee’s_ third-
ranked lacrosse Generals ran their
1974 season record to 11-0 this
week, but by no means were the
two wins recorded by W&L easy
ones,

Towson State, the number one
ranked team in the college di-
vision, had the Generals on the
ropes Saturday, but clutch goals
by Ted Bauer and Skip Lichtfuss
in both the final quarter and the
overtime period gave W&L a 19-
17 win over what head coach
Jack Emmer called “the best la-
crosse team we've played ali
year.”

Tuesday W&L started poorly,
and trailed upstart Roanoke Col-
lege 5-3 at halftime. The Generals
managed to get things together in
the second half, however, and
went on to record a 12-7 win over
a fast-improving Maroon team.

Emmer called Saturday’s high-
scoring fiasco “the greatest ex-
hibition of offensive lacrosse I’ve
ever been associated with in one
ball game.”

“You can’t totally blame the de-
fense for all 36 goals,” Emmer
added. “When you're passing and
shooting as well as both teams did
there’s no way that goals won't
be scored.”

Emmer pointed out that goalie
Skeet Chadwick was playing de-
spite being weakened by a virus
that had plagued him for several!
days.

Chadwick still came up with
15 saves, including two key stops
late in regulation play. The co-
captain’s biggest save of the day
came in the first overtime, when
he robbed Bob Griebe of a goal,
then triggered the fast break
which eventually led to Bauer’s
go-ahead tally.

xoals came in bunches Satur-
day. After Joe Doegherty opened
the scoring for the Tigers, Dave
Warfield and Lichtfuss tallied
within twenty seconds of each
other to give W&L a 2-1 lead.

Towson then got three straight
scores from Mitch Lekas, Wayne
Eisenhut, and Tom Nelson to go
on top 4-2.

The number-three ranked Generals struggled past Roanoke Tuesday in a home game on Wilson Field,
J

Three more regular season games remain for the unbeaten Generals.

W&L erupted for five in a row
the first and early second quart-
ers to grab a 7-4 lead. Don Car-
roll got his first after a brilliant
full-field clear by defenseman
Tom Keigler at 9:24. Warfield and
Lichtfuss notched their second
goals late in the opening period
to give the Generals a 5-4 edge at
the quarter.

Opening the second quarter,
Bryan Chasney and Ken Miller
got goals six and seven for W&L,
and it looked like the Generals
were about to take control.

However Towson coach Car]
Runk said something to his troops
during a timeout, and it must
have worked. The Tigers ran off
four goals in the next two
minutes to jump back on top
8-7. Three of the scores, by Nel-
son, Tom Moore, and Jim Darc-
angelo, came just 45 second apart.

The Generals tied it up at 8-5
when Carroll got his second tally.
Griebe and Warfield traded scores
late in the period to send the
teams to the locker room tied at
9-9,

Towson broke the deadlock
early in the third when Moore
got his second score at 2:32. Then
the Generals tallied twice to move
back in front 11-10. Warfield
scored his fourth, Carroll his
third, both the result of fast
breaks led by freshman midfield-
ers Ralph Baugher and Jay
Monahan.

But Towson again rebounded,
this time with a string of three
goals from Tim Maher, Larry
Syratton, and Griebe, and took a
13-11 lead heading to the final
quarter.

In the fourth period, W&L be-
came the beneficiaries of several
Towson penalties as well as the
services of Ted Bauer. The All-
American midfielder opened the
scoring in the final fifteen with
Towson shorthanded to cut the
margin to 13-12. Bauer then as-
sisted on Warfield’s fifth goal,
again with the Tigers a man
down, to tie the game at 13-13.

Just 11 seconds after Carroll’s
goal, Nelson threw in his third
to regain the lead for the Tigers,

14-18. Griebe then got his third
at 4:48 to put Towson two goals
up.

Carroll cut the margin to one
with his fourth score, the third
Generals’ extra man goal of the
period at 5:22. But Towson then
opened up a three goal bulge,
with Darcangelo and Lekas con:
necting within 19 seconds to give
the Tigers a 17-14 lead.

Then the rally began. Carroll
fired in his fifth and final score
at 7:19 to make it 17-15. At 12:16,
3auer got his second, and the
Generals were within one.

Towson went to a slowdown to
try to protect their lead. Emmer
called his defense to pressure the
ball, forcing the Tigers to handle
it. With :48 left on the clock,
W&L gained control of the ball
in their own end,

Obviously, the Generals had
their work cut out for them, as
they had to clear the ball, set up
a play, and score. Nothing went
wrong.

Keigler, displaying outstanding
stickwork with his long defense-
man’s stick, moved the ball well
upfield, and found Chasney wide
open. Chasney got the ball to
Lichtfuss, and the stage was set.

Baseball team loses to Ham

By BILL AUSTIN

Score:

W&L 1—Hampden-Sydney 5

In a single contest played a
week ago Wednesday, W&L’s
baseball team dropped its eighth
game in 14 decisions, this time
to a Hampden-Sydney squad it
had earlier defeated.

Further, the Generals did not
gain a berth in the VCAA tourney,
and thus spent the weekend in
idleness while Lynchburg College
romped to the conference title
with a 15-9 pounding of Madison.

While the Hampden-Sydney
game proved a frustrating affair,
the news which followed only
re-enforced glum spirits. Rod
Ferrandino, who struggled in the
5-1 loss to the Tigers, was found
to be ill. The revelation surely
ends the season for the talented

junior moundsman.

In what turned out to be Fer-
vandino’s swan-song, W&L post-
ed a 1-0 lead that held into the
seventh inning. Alas, Ferrandino
contributed directly to his own
downfall, allowing a single, then
hitting two batters with errant
tosses. A pair of wild pitches fol-
lowed, and two H-S runners
steamed homeward. A sacrfice fly
scored a third run. The Tigers
added two more tallies in the
eighth, protecting but their fifth
triumph of the season.

Following the home tilt with
Madison played Tuesday (the re-
sult was not available at press
time), the Generals close out their
season this coming week with a
doubleheader against Bridgewater
on Monday and a rematch with
Lynchburg Baptist on Tuesday.
The Bridgewater encounter marks

WEL places second
in VCAA tennis meet

Washington and Lee’s reign as
VCAA tennis champion ended this
past weekend, when Hampton
Institute took command of the
three-day tournament in impres-
sive fashion.

The Generals managed to ac-
cumulate 70 points in team com-
petition, good for second place,
but far behind Hampton’s 116.
Indeed, the usurping squad took
every singles and doubles title in

Sunday’s final-round action.

For W&L, John Embree, Don
Caffery, Buz Walters, Jim Fisher
and Warren Davis advanced suc-
cessfully through the first two
days of play, but succumbed to
HI’s_ well-scholarshipped repre-
sentatives without winning a
single set. In similar fashion, the
doubles combinations of Embree-
Caffery and Davis-Voelker took
runner-up honors in numbers one
and three seeded matches.

Five Generals honored as outstanding athletes

Five General athletes have been
chosen to appear in the 1974 edi-

Track records fall,
WEL ts 4th in state

By HARRY JEMBE

At a tough Virginia College
Athletic Association (V.C.A.A.)
track meet last Saturday, hosted
by Bridgewater College, W&L
shattered two state records and
one school mark.

Sprinter Phipher Helms won
the 220 yard dash for the third
straight time setting a state rec-
ord in 22.0 seconds. This qualifies
Phipher for College Nationals this
year,

Tony Perry won the high jump
event with a leap of six feet
three and three-fourths inches,
also. breaking the old mark.
Tony’s jump of 6’ 6” last Tuesday
against Indiana State places him
for the Nationals.

Another spectacular perform-
ance was by freshman Paul
Thomson. Thomson destroyed the
existing mile record held earlier
by Stu Nibley by more than five
seconds. He ran a sub 4 minutes

20 seconds mile race for the first

time.

The 440 relay team emerged
the state champion at the meet.
Larry Banks, John Tucker, John
Newman and again Phipher
Helms came as close as one-tenth
off the school record. They were
timed at 43.3 seconds for the first
place. Their superior baton ex-
changes held off a strong chal-
lenge from the Virginia State
quartet.

Other performances: Steve Sch-
weizerhof—shot put, first; Paul
Hartman—pole vault, 13 feet,
career best only three inches off
the record; Dave Lawson—440
yards, third, 50.9 seconds; Dave
Estes—880 yards, 2.00.07, his best
time this year; John Newman—
100 yards, 9.9 seconds; Jack Berry
—javelin, fourth in the state.

Final team placement: 1. Vir-
ginia o> 2, Madison, 3. Lynch-
surg, 4. Washington and Lee.

Generals trip Towson in overtime,
come back to win over Roanoke

(Continued from page 6)
Tigers’ best defensive middie,
Lichtfuss took the ball behind the
goal. He then took off to the left
of Tiger goalie Jeff Jones, and
fired a low shot past Jones on
the run. Bring on the overtime.

Lichtfuss controlled the open-
ing faceoff in the first overtime,
but a Warfield shot hit a Towson
player, and the Tigers came up
with the ball.

Two Towson shots went wide,
but they got the ball back when
Keigler lost the ball out of
bounds. Then came Chadwick’s
robbery of Griebe, followed by the
Generals’ fast break.

Two perfect passes sent War-
field toward a one-on-one con-
frontation with Jones. But Tow-
son’s Dan Miller tripped Warfield
from behind, so W&L was re-
warded with an extra man for
a minute.

It didn’t take long for the Gen-
erals to go ahead. Bauer took a
feed from John Lalley, wound up,
and left Jones looking at a blur.
W&L had their first lead since
midway through the third period
at 18-17.

Lichtfuss added the clincher
with :18 gone in the second extra
period. Taking the faceoff again,

Record review:
Airto & Deodato

(Continued from page 3)

Flora Purim, Airto’s wife and
vocalist, could well become the
1970’s evolution-equivalent of
Grace Slick, because she has the
ability to soar above the sound
of the instruments with the same
sort of mystical banshee-ange!
style. Their music on this album
proves beyond a doubt that Airto
has taken Santana’s former title
as king latino-rocker-jazzer.

Deodato’s cuts are another mat-
ter. Eumir Deodato has always
tread the thin line between easy
listening and jazz, also known as
the line between mechanical and
creative music. His live selections
succeed mainly because of two
sidemen: John Tropea on electric
guitar and Ray Barretto on conga.
Deodato himself would probably
sound better with a small group
in a restaurant-club situation than
he does here. With a flourish in
the distinct CTI style, he’s even
dubbed strings onto the music,
which is highly unusual for a live
recording.

Judging from the skimpy (by
CTI standards) cover and the fact
that neither artist performs any-
thing he hasn’t recorded before,
the album comes off as more of
a sampler record than anything
else. It succeeds, beautifully.

NOTICES

The University Council will
meet at 4:30 p.m. in the Execu-
tive Committee room of the Uni-
versity Center.

Lichtfuss passed off to Bauer,
who returned the ball the Licht-
fuss, Who had no trouble beating
Jones for his fourth goal of the
game. There the scoring ended,
and soon after, ended one of the
best lacrosse games ever played
on Wilson Field.

Tuesday was different. Roanoke
came up Route 81 thinking up-
set, and came close to realizing
their dreams,

The Generals played sloppy la-
crosse in the first half, allowing
the Maroons to fire from point-
blank range at Malcolm Hastings,
who replaced a resting Chadwick
as the W&L goalie. Three goals
in the last six minutes of the
half gave the underdogs a 5-3
lead at intermission.

Then Wé&L played as_ they
should, taking control from the
outset of the second half. The
Generals outscored Roanoke 9-2
in the final 30 minutes, including
another of those runs of five
goals in a row, and downed the
Maroons 12-7,

Three Generals—Lalley, Watr-
field, and Carroll—recorded the
three-goal hat trick, while Bauer
chipped in with one goal and four
assists.

Up and coming are home games
Saturday with a tough Washing-
ton College ten (2 p.m.) and
Wednesday with Franklin and
Marshall (3 p.m.).
