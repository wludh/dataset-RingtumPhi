Candidates for two of the Big
Three offices are running uncon-
tested.

Junior Ben Bailey is running
unopposed for student body presi-
dent, and sophomore Mike Luttig
has no opposition in his race for
student body secretary.

Three juniors are competing
for student body vice-president:
Bob Keatley, Chris Scully, and
Ben Sherman. If no majority is
won by an candidate, there wil!
be a run-off,

Elections are next Monday, the
Executive Committee said. Polls
will be open from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
at Washington Hall, the Co-op,
Tucker Hall, and the freshman
quad. Run-offs, if necessary, will
be next Thursday.

All candidates will speak and
answer questions at Evans Dining

Hall tonight at 7 p.m.

Each candidate is allowed to
spend $10 in the primary and $5
in the runoff. Expense accounts
are due in the EC box Sunday at
6 p.m. Only 50 posters are per-
mitted at one time, and these can-
not be placed on the front colon-
nade or white areas of buildings.

Streakers exhibit skills here

By PAUL LANCASTER

Streaking has struck.

The latest campus phenomenon
known as streaking caught the
Washington and Lee community
with its pants down, so to speak,
Saturday night as approximately
40 nude, apparently sane students
ran a “streak” up and down the
front Colonnade of Washington
and Lee,

It began with a few apparently
harmless comments about streak-
ing on the “Oldies Authority,”
WLUR-FM’s Saturday morning
radio show. The comments, made
by one of the co-hosts of the pro-
gram, reportedly solicited a num-
ber of phone calls from self-pro-
claimed “streaking societies,”
each claiming to be the only

legitimate such group on campus.

Then, five streakers, perhaps
in an effort to demonstrate their
group’s streaking superiority,
dashed through the WLUR
studios.

One thing led to another, and
finally, sometime Saturday night,
the word was passed. W&L’s
streak was on. Or off, as the
case may be,

In addition to the Colonnade
escapade, a small roving band
of W&L  semi-streakers (they
Were clad in raincoats) prepared
for a massive streak across the
Virginia Military Institute cam-
pus, They were thwarted, how-
ever, by security men stationed
at VMI,

Since then, rumors have been

circulating about future streaks,
but as of press time, none had
occurred. Among the rumors: a
streak during “D” hour( at about
il a.m.) Monday morning along
the Colonnade; a shameless dash
across the floor of Doremus Gym-
nasium during columnist Art
Buchwald’s speech there; and a
streak, or series thereof, across
Wilson Field Saturday as the
Washington and Lee lacrosse
team opens its season at home.

But there’s nothing new
under the moon, as they say.
In fact, the art of streaking
(no, it won't be offered as a
Spring Term course here) is
170 years old at Washington
and Lee.

An unimpeachable source (that

study would cost $150. The EC
is considering the proposal.

Freshman representative Scott
Franklin reported on the Health
Service Committee meeting. He
said any complaints about health
care should be given to Dean
John. University Physician Dr.
Feddeman believed that there is
insufficient need for a full-time
doctor.

In other news, the EC decided
to discuss the Report of the Com.
mittee on Election Procedures
next week. The plan provides for
an impartial committee which
would man polls, enforce election
procedures, and count ballots.

Spring break,

exams changed

By PAUL MORELLA
A motion calling for the post-
ponement of the start of the

spring semester until Tuesday,
April 16, was passed by the Uni-
versity Council last Thursday

night, thus alleviating the prob-
lem of returning to school on a
gas-short Easter Sunday.

In addition, the UC delegated
the faculty Executive Committee
to determine how to make up the
lost day of classes.

Previously, spring term classes
were scheduled to begin on Mon-
day, April 15, and students would
have to return to school on Sun-

that the 1804 incident is recorded
in the archives of the Washing-
ton and Lee Board of Trustees. A.
student with the innocuous name
of William Crump was appre-
hended (we're not sure how) run-
ning naked through the streets
of the peaceful little community
of Lexington at 7:30 in the morn:

Crump pleaded guilty, and the
trustees in a _ precedent-setting
decision (or so we hope for to-

day’s streakers) merely repri-
manded him.
AS a matter of note, “naked

Crump,” as he was called, later
became a Congressman and an
ambassador to Chile.

And that’s the naked truth,

Addenda

Throughout the school year, we’ve been jotting down a list of
odds and ends which we felt we should speak to as the need arose
and the space became available. So here’s the list:

—Why doesn’t Buildings and Grounds get around to fixing the
door to the game room of the University Center? The outside handle
has been broken off for months now, and to get. inside, a person
has to pound on the door and interrupt somebody’s pinball, foosball
or pool game, because someone already inside the game room has to
open the door for the person outside.

—While we’re addressing Buildings and Grounds, how about the
mudslides across the sidewalks in front of the Lee-Jackson and
faculty houses? Every time it rains, cascades of mud go tumbling
down the barren slopes near the two houses, and the mud inevitably
decides to come to rest on the sidewalks, leaving them slippery when
wet, dirty when dry, and messy anytime. Something can be done to
alleviate the situation.

—With elections coming up in the next few weeks, posters wilil
present themselves as another campus eyesore with which viewers
of our national historic landmark must contend. A committee has
been set up by the Executive Committee to study the problem, but
it appears that nothing will be done before the onslaught of campaign
posters hits campus. We hope something is done soon.

—Now that security has supposedly been tightened at Doremus
Gym to keep non-students, non-faculty, and non-staff out, why is the
gym teaming with non-students, non-faculty, and non-staff at various
times? Rumor has it that Doremus Gym was built for members of
the Washington and Lee community, but at times, that contention
could be doubted.

—P.J.L.

It’s election time

This week, of course, marks the launching of that yearly escapade
known as election time. Monday, students vote for the Big Three
(as opposed to the Big Five of years past—Fancy Dress and vice-
president of the Dance Board are now gone). The Big Three, by the
way, are the president, vice-president and secretary of the student
body.

Then, the following week, petitions will be due for the remainder
of EC positions up for grabs in the winter term. Historically, candi-
dates for these offices consist of those who lost in the Big Three
elections in the week previous. The menu for the second course of
election meal lists die-hard campus politicos as its main entree.

Finally, in the spring term (not all that far away) come elections
for University Council. By this time only the most desperate of
political hopefuls on campus (sprinkled with those who originally
wanted to run for a Big Three office but who couldn’t get up the
courage to run for any office until now) making up the political
spectre.

Add to this the election of class officers during this time and
you have students voting, and running, for more than 30 campus
offices. And don’t forget Interfraternity Council elections.

Don’t forget referenda and the like, either. Coming up will be an
Executive Committee pol] on the Honor System; and, of course, the
third annual coeducation referendum will be presented for your
pleasure. And rumors are circulating that certain members of the
EC are going to propose a constitutional amendment calling for
open Publications Board meetings. This is in response to the Ring-tum
Phi’s adamant stand for on amendment opening EC meetings in all
instances except discussion of possible honor violations (the amend-
ment passed). Whether the rumors are true remains to be seen; the
fact of the matter is we didn’t know that Publications Board meet-
ings were closed to begin with.

The point is that the long, drawn-out process of student body
elections at Washington and Lee has begun, and it’s a cinch the
elections will be interesting to some, boring to most. The elections
will obviously fail to approach last-year’s mind-boggling contest be-
tween seeming radical Doug Schwartz and opponent Lewis Powell,
seeming personification of all the things which Schwartz attacked.

For all its excitement, the Schwartz-Powell confrontation didn’t
really mean much, Looking over the goals and accomplishments of
this year’s EC, it would be hard to tell that seeming radical Schwartz
won the election.

The most splendiferous election campaign in recent years at W&L,
then, apparently didn’t produce anything startling in its outcome.
Forecasting a more boring battle for EC president this year, we
fear, at best, the same results,

We hope such is not the case, and we hope the campaigners stick
to what they say they stand for, if they are elected.

A reply to Reeves
Sir:

I am obligated to respond to
the review of Mr. Blouin’s new
course in the Art Department by
Jess Reeves. More than three
approaches come to mind, but;
1, tell him to go to hell, 2. ignore
his review as if he really did
mean it to be a joke...meta-
physical sarcasm of the ugliest
sort (on both my part and his),
or 3. try to reason out what
underlies this sort of condescen-
sion and assess what it means
to our educational, metaphysical
and actual community. This for-
mat is best suited to the last of
these arbitrary three.

Reeves manages to express con-
tempt for craft, as well as art,
(the relationship of which he
would do well to explore by look-
ing up W. Gropius and the
Bauhaus Movement in pre-WW II,
Weimar), for coeds, mechanics,
Goshen, Va., and all the people
in the area and community en-
gaged in woodwork, blacksmith-
ing, leatherwork, etc. ... or
participating in any of the other
arts such as music, drama, crea-
tive writing, etc. ... and even
for ‘the old Greeks. This leaves
me in a big dilemma when faced
with the question of who Jess
Reeves is and where he thinks he
is living. At least I do know that
he thinks we should all be doing
what he is doing .. . and that
it isn’t art.

For me to hazard a guess
about his categorical ancestory
in this fragmented institution
would be an undeserved slight to
on of its parts (except the ad-
ministration . . . whose lessons
we all must learn), because the
truth of the matter is that all
the arts here have been kept in
a socio-economic dead-end; shov-
ed off into the spare rooms on
campus...and here is Mr. Reeves
ghost (living in a world where
he takes advantage of the craft
of others but considering their
actual performance to be beneath
his integrity—); the most power-
ful reminder of the reason why
we al] have to put up with poorly
designed and constructed neces-

RULERS TO THE EDITOR

OUTLOOK and REVIEW

sities . . . and with members
of our community who take ad-
vantage of their education here
not to help create and sustain a
fair society, but to become part
of the ever-growing elite bureau-
cracy who serve to introduce, not
quality, but scientific-playfulness
into every field of human en-
deavor and priority. This ghost
is our example of a man out of
touch. And quite frankly, he is
our strongest argument for an
arts center that we, as a com-
munity have to face; the oppres-
sion inherent in his attitude, the
most dangerous.

Sincerely,

Scott Ainslie

Defending the arts
Sir:

We found Mr. Reeves’ attitude
last week concerning the offering
of a course in arts and crafts at
Washington and Lee to be highly
revolting. His contempt for those
desiring to learn something about
manual crafts and arts is blatant-
ly snobbish and his remarks
about basket weaving for the
blind is disgusting. We have sev-
eral friends in Lexington who are
engaged in such “minor,” “ri-
diculous” crafts as blacksmithing,
leather-working, woodworking,
and automobile repair, and we
suggest that they require as much
talent and energy to excell in as
any career that Mr. Reeves might
seek out for himself.

It is certainly hoped that it
is not Mr. Reeves’ pursuit of
“major” educational topics which
has led him to such a narrow
contempt towards interests out-
side the purely academic field, for
such is just the opposite of the
liberal attitude this institution at-
tempts to instill in its students.

In conclusion, it is sincerely
hoped that Mr. Reeves’ car never
breaks down in Goshen.

Sincerely,

Scott Nelson

Ask Traveller

Ask Traveller: Interview with a Streaker

    

Traveller: “Well, you Greeks really set the campus on fire over the
weekend with your streaking exhibition, didn’t you?”

Streaker: “Sure did! Pretty keen, wasn’t it?”

Traveller: “Terribly.”

Streaker: “Yeah, and the Alumni magazine might even do a special
feature on it if Bob Keefe has room between the commemorative
plate offer and the In Memoriam section. Pretty keen, eh?’

Traveller: “Awfully. Tell me, what exactly motivated you to toss off
your clothes and streak—thrills, notoriety, a sense of the grotes-
que?”

Streaker: “Nah. The fella that organized the streak—one of the
Geology professors, I think, who called us his igneous lads—
said that our act would strike a blow for Life, Liberty, and the
right to force-feed iguanas. He told us the same thing, too, after
Kent State, when we had to memorize lyrics to every Crosby,
Stills, & Nash song and wear black armbands that kept slipping
down so they looked like formal French cuffs.”

Traveller: “Yes, but why did you personally streak?”

Streaker: “I didn’t have a date.”

Traveller: “But didn’t you feel slightly silly prancing around naked?”

Streaker: “Sort of. But the other guys said it was the in-thing to do.”

Traveller: “Like swallowing goldfish used to be?”

Streaker: “What? Who’d do a dumb think like that?”

Traveller: “Never mind. It’s old hat.. like streaking. Didn’t you know
that by Saturday night half the schools this side of the equator
had already done it, and that by streaking, then, in the dark,
it only made W&L look stupid?”

Streaker: “We couldn’t let UVa get the honor. After all, aren’t all
Wahoos gray in the dark? Ha, ha, ha.”

Traveller: “No doubt. Say, remember the old Ozzie and Harriet shows
where Ricky’s frat chums did crazy things like write ‘Beat State’
on the blackbord before the big game? Or hide dead carp in
David’s undewear?”

Streaker: “Ha, ha, ha. Pretty keen, right?”

Traveller: “Do you think so?”

Streaker: “Sure! Why?”

Traveller: “Oh, no reason really. You dropped one of your topsiders.”

Inside-Out

By ROME SCOTT
Entertainment Editor

They all wanted it for themselves—the ones who write the soft
love lyrics, the hard, funky movers and the boogie rock and the rest.

“Communicate man, Yeah, just communicate. I’ve got something
to say to everybody. Now, to find a way to make people listen.” They
feel that and, still, it’s hard to believe they’re all human.

The superstars. The dudes who stand on the stage in front of so
many. Ah, but they’re human.

The Peter Townsends and Jim Messinas and Joe Walshes are all
human. And they have something to say—the ones who are after
the music first, the dollar second. They show sensitivity.

Music is about that too.

Hard, soft, soul, rock, country or what. It doesn’t matter. The
sincere artist is a real human trying to put something in the public
ear that feels so much you want to dance or sing or shout or cry.
Those are the real musicians, the figures shadowing a dimly lit stage
shaking their souls on a string trying to share it with the audience.

Those are the musicians to whom the man on the front row says
“amen.”

The critic is after the real ones.

And it matters. The real critic cares so much about the music
he considers judgement a burden, a matter as important as the effort
the musician puts into the songs he plays.

But if the musician lets the critic down...

Above all, though, the reader is the rider. He is the one sitting
in final judgment of both. The reader has the edge. He says where
the fault lies. “That critic’s all wrong. Tin ears, no eyes,” is the
usual reaction. Sometimes “Man, that critic’s got a lot on the ball
That musician ain’t worth a damn.”

And that’s where the reader should be. If the critic fails, the
reader is the one who loses. He doesn’t learn anything.

The real critic put himself in the “amen corner” and, in doing
so, takes it upon himself to expose himself to every bit of music
and what goes into it.

There lies the rub. A critic has got to find out what is behind all
music, not just what he prefers.

The average listener exposes himself only to the music he enjoys
and, even then, never asks, ‘Why do I like this guy’s music? What
is it about this song that moves me?”

There’s no need for the listener to ask any questions. If the music
says something to him it’s enough. That’s the way it should be.

The critic asks the questions so often they become reflex. He’s
got to say something when the music stops.

And confronted with the problem of public credibility, many a
critic would say, “I know what I mean. I have something to say. If
this guy stands up before me and doesn’t give as much to this
audience as he can, I’m gonna nail him.”

Most critics will—for the reader, music and themselves.

% a a %

Many at a recent concert in Roanoke found that it’s hard to say
no to Yes.

The five-man British band put on a show and punched out some
msuic that will be talked about again and again.

Excerpts from Stravinsky’s “Firebird Suite’ opened the concert
but soon gave way to Yes’ own “Siberian Khatru” a fine example
of immense power, supported by delicate balance, in the group's
music.

 

Well-coordinated syncopation was the background for fragile and
graceful instrumentals.

Jon Anderson’s voice powered out misty melodies surrounded by
a body of solid, intrinsically classical rock.

Steve Howe’s lead guitar, Chris Squire’s bass, Rick Wakeman’s
keyboards and Alan White’s drums created, with Anderson’s voice,
a montage of modes ranging from rock to jazz to classical.

The clarity and precision of the group’s live sound confirms that
the band is not just a studio group.

All of the sounds heard on the group’s records are sounds they
can produce live.

The end of Yes’ concert was met by a standing ovation which
brought the group back to go “Roundabout,” the song that launched
the band in America.

After hearing the band perform live, one does not wonder why
the group calls itself Yes. The feeling is Yes’ music is emphatically
affirmative.

4 students admit guilt in painting of Washington Hall statue

The Student Control] Committee
passed sentence Tuesday night on
the four students found guilty of
painting the statue of George
Washington on top of Washing-
ton Hall. In a majority decision
the committee decided that those
responsible, Peter Cimmino,
Tertius Keiger, Joel Williams, and
Jess Reeves, should reimburse
the university for the cost of
repainting the statue.

The students made a free and
open admission of their guilt. In
their own defense they said that
the escapade had been motivated
by a desire to restore some of the
Jost traditions of the school. They

also pointed out that the univer-
sity had not suffered as a result
of their action and to the con-
trary had received good publicity.

The Student Control] Committee
states that it felt that they should
put the schoo] back in the same
situation it was in before the
incident took place. This would
entail paying for the repainting
of the statue which has been ac-
complished by the maintenance
crew.

The four are expected to pick
up a tab which it is estimated
will run in the neighborhood of
$250. The committee also so show-

ed concern for the welfare of the
students and the effect an acci-
dent on such a caper might have
had on the university.

The four artists will have the
right to appeal their case to the
Student Affairs Committee. Im-
mediately after a verdict was
handed down last Tuesday night
the condemned men announced
their intention to appeal the
case. The four felt that the pen-
alty was too harsh and did not
take into account any of the spill-
over benefits derived from the
painting. Their case may be heard
by the SAC in a meeting today.

day, April 14. Because of the gaso-
line shortage, however, students
living more than one full tank
of gas away, could easily en-
counter travel difficulties in at-
tempting to return on Sunday.
Before making their decision, the
UC was presented with the signa-
tures of 590 students and the
Executive Committee’s endorse-
ment of the proposed change.

Unlike the arguments for chang:
ing the winter break, the argu-
ments for changing the start of
the spring break were much more
valid. For example, because the
spring semester is over a month
away, many students have yet to
make travel plans. Also, it is be-
coming increasingly harder to
find an open gas station on a
Sunday, particularly Easter Sun-
day.

At the same meeting, another
motion was passed concerning
the winter term exam schedule.
The motion will add an extra
exam period on Saturday,
March 30, from 2-5 p.m, The
remainder of the exam periods
will remain as scheduled.

Curriculum survey to be distributeed in classes Wednesday, Thursday

By HERB RUBENSTEIN

For the first time Washington
and Lee students will take class
time to evaluate their professors
and courses.

Next Wednesday and Thursday
professors will distribute curri-
culum evaluation questionnaires.
Each student will be asked to
evaluate the course he receives
his questionnaire in and through-
out the two days he will have a
chance to evaluate all his winter
courses.

The questionnaire was prepar-
ed by the Student Curriculum
Committee and was unanimously

approved by the Executive Com-
mittee. With the faculty approval
of the use of class time, students
now have an opportunity to sup-
ply the Curriculum Committee
with much needed information.

The Committee will compile the
results of the survey this spring
and the results will be published
in a handbook during the fall
semester next year. This will
make the information gathered in
the survey easily available for
student use.

If you have any suggestions for
future surveys or wish to help
in the tabulation of the results,

Are you a superfan?

Thursday,

A Wa&L basketball fan quiz

By BILL FLESHER

So you call yourself a TRUE
fan of Washington and Lee
basketball, huh?

Can you say to anyone with a
clear conscience that you stuck
with the 1974 Generals through
all the disappointments until the
end, an end which very few mem-
bers of the W&L community ex-
pected?

Well, here’s a way to measure
your loyalty to this year’s round-
ballers. Admittedly, it’s not as
exciting as Ann Landers’ quiz
which determines your “experi-
ence with the opposite sex,” but
I think you'll find it interesting
nevertheless.

Ready (no cheating, now; this
fa\'s under the Honor System).

Give yourself.....

Two points for every W&L
home game you attended in its
entirity (one point for being
at one half or more, no points
for missing or just “peeking in’).

Five points for any away game
you attended.

One point for every game you
listened to on WLUR.

Two points if you watched the
W&L-Madison game on TY.

Five points for taking a date
to a game (maximum 10 points).

Five points if you can match
each plaver to his uniform num-
ber.

Five points for attending the
entire W&L Invitational (all four
games),

Now, it’s penalty

Take away

Ten points for not even know-

time.

ing that there was a home game
on any given night.

Ten points for each time you
had to ask someone either what
the basketball team’s record was,
or, whether the team had recent-
ly had a game, or, if W&L even
had a basketball team.

Time to add up. Now, if your
score fell between 0 (or a nega-
tive amount) and 15 points, you
are a poor excuse for a fan in
my opinion. In fact, if you fall
into this category, I wonder why
you even bother reading the
sports pages. (Editor’s note: Not
for the basketball articles, that’s
for sure.)

If your score is in the 16-30
points range, all I can say is
that you made a “weak effort.”
Weak at best.

From 31-40 points, “good effort’
laurels are bestowed upon you.
But try a little harder next time,
for look what’s one step up.

From 41-65 points, congratula-
tions, for you are a FAN. Keep
up the good work.

And, if you got above 65 points,
you qualify for the first annual
SUPERFAN competion, to be
held soon at Shea Stadium.

Don’t be discouraged if you
scored poorly, however. There’s
still a chance to redeem your-

selves.

Baseball squad readies for opener

By BILL AUSTIN

This past Saturday was a day
made to order for baseball, and
it coincided nicely with Coach
Lyles’ plans for a pair of inter-
squad scrimmages.

For a team pent up in the con-
fines of Doremus Gymnasium
since Jan. 20, the games played
exhibited both the potential of
the freshmen-dominated team,
and the difficulties of pulling to-
gether disparate, untested talents.

For Lyles, the role is quite
simply that of educator. He faces
the task of making the intricacies
of defensive and offensive play
the fluid, unthinking movements
of habit. Yet, in this, his sixteenth
spring-season with a _ General
team, he is clearly enjoying the
challenge.

“I think we’re ahead of the
game at this stage,” Lyles as-
serted after the final scrimmage
had been concluded. He admitted
that the quick progress was due

partly to the  unseasonable
warmth (75 degrees on March
2 ?!?), but also pointed to the

dedication toward practice ex-
hibited by the 31 players involved
in this year’s try-outs. “They’re
working hard.”

Surely the evidenced desire is
important for W&L’s chances to
match or better last year’s 11-12
won-lost mark. Because of the
graduation of many, including the
slugging Ellie Gutshall and short-
stop Doug Clelan, the current
squad must build its nucleus
on the talents of but a few vet-
erans.

Key to the inexperienced pitch-
ing corps is junior Rod Fer-
randino, a moundsman Lyles
praised lavishly for his cunnning
and control. “He mixes his pitches
well, and possesses an excellent
curve.” Ferrandino must supply
the stability, indeed, the maturity
of the staff. In addition, six
freshmen and a sophomore give
the team a potentially fine set
of hurlers.

In a moment of unchecked opti-
mism, Lyles remarked, “this
could be my best team. Maybe
not this year, but next. You
could say that I’m smiling a
hidden smile. The talent is there.”

Yet, he has reservations, and
should, for the schedule is de-
manding and his line-up is far
from set. Reviewing the list of
opponents, Lyles wrly observed
that “I can’t predict a number
of victories on paper. We may
lose a lot of games, We may not.
Mental errors, or rather, the lack
of them, will determine whether
or not we win ball games.”

To be sure, the difference be-
tween victory and defeat in base-
ball often comes down to a mo-
ment’s hesitation, to a lapse in
concentration. For a squad lack-
ing long-ball power, blazing speed,

or abundant experience, the turned first baseman, apepars to
penchant to defeat oneself be swining a potent bat, collect-

through mental sloppiness could
easily make for a_ season of
frustration.

Undeniably, the talent is there.
Freshman SBen_ Bonaventura’s
skills at shortstop have been
particularly impressive in the
early stages. His fine showing has
enabled Lyles to move co-captain
Don Hathway to centerfield in
an effort to shore up the middle
of the team’s defense. John Rice,
basketball-playing soph recently

ing five hits in the scrimmages.
Junior Dave Otey seems a prime
candidate for third base chores.

Several positions are still up
for grabs. Perhaps the most
fiercely contested spot is at sec-
ond base, where as many as three
players have a shot at seeing
considerable action.

ule with a visit from W.Va. Insti-
