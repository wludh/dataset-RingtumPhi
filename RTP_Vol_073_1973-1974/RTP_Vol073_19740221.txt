EC hears debate on student tax use
for hiring lawyer for student body

By ROBERT PUGH

The EC discussed two proposals
for part of next year’s budget, a
student body lawyer and a tax
“rebate.”

Student Body President Doug
Schwartz suggested that the stu-
dent body hire an attorney to
handle student body cases and
advise individuals students who
have legal problems. Schwartz
thought $400 (25 cents per stu-
dent) from the student tax would
be an adequate fee. A local at-
torney will discuss the proposal
with the EC March 4.

Student Activity Board Chair-
man Mike Brittin asked the EC
to allocate $5 of the student tax
for use of the individual student.
Each would designate where he
wanted his money to go—speak-
ers, gym equipment, concerts, or
whatever.

Brittin said students with good
ideas could thus go around and
get others interested. This would
increase student participation in
university affairs. Vice President
and ex officio Treasurer Steve
Greene did not think adequate
funds existed to implement the
project next vear. Other EC mem-

bers questioned the proposal’s
workability. The idea is being
studied by an EC committee.

Sophomore rep Leland McCul-
lough suggested that the EC start
a petition about adding Monday,
April 15, to the spring break, so
students would not have to drive
back on a gasless Easter Sunday.
Petitions will be in the Co-op.
Students should voice their opin-
ion to EC or University Council
members. The UC meets next
Thursday and will discuss the
vacation’s length.

Junior John Killpack asked the
EC to make strict regulations
about posters on the campus. The
amount of posters, especially out-
of-date ones, is ridiculous, he said.
The idea is being studied.

Next week:

—Honor System questionnaire
discussion;
—report of Election Guidelines
Committee;

—regulations on posting notices;

—discussion of Spring Break;

—Library Committee report;

—discussion of the Commerce Re-
view;

Constitutional amendment referendum passes

By PAUL MORELLA

The constitutional amendment
calling for open EC meetings ex-
cept in the case of possible honor
violations passed last week.

Of the 941 students voting, 675
voted for the amendment, while
266 voted against it.

Ted Amshoff, an amendment
proponent, spoke out on the “de-
plorable practices” which he said
the EC used during the time pre-
ceeding the election and during

the election itself, In suggesting
that steps be taken in order to
see that the alleged tactics don’t
happen again, Amshoff also pre-
sented the EC with a set of pro-
posed election guidlines.

In relation to the poster cir-
culated before the election, Am-
shoff argued that the EC “used
student body funds to push view-
points with which the students
didn’t agree.” In addition, he

OUTLOOK and REVIEW

On EC voting reform proposals

With the passage of a constitutional amendment last week limit-
ing closed Executive Committee sessions to discussion of possible
honor violations only came a bit more than just a victory for the
student’s right to know.

Charges and countercharges were tossed about like stale rolls in
a cafeteria food fight about unethical conduct by pro and con alike
during the three-day amendment voting. Proponents of the amend-
ment said certain members of the EC were running around like
turkeys with their heads cut off telling students to vote no on the
proposal, and EC members charged proponents with similar tactics,
refering to solicitation of votes for the proposal by what on student
called “Young Republican gorillas.”

Out of this verbal warfare came a proposal by one of the alleged
“gorillas” to bring an end to the possibility of unehical tactics during
voting on anv issue. He proposed the following:

—No actual vote count or count of the ballots shall be made be-
fore the close of balloting on the final day of voting. Official record
of the number and names of those students who have voted shall be
available at the end of the day’s balloting to any member of the
student body.

—Student body funds shall not be expended for the purpose of
influencing a student body vote on any matter; though expenditures
of student body funds for the purpose of publication of clearly im-
partial explanations or clarification of an issue shall be permitted.

—Those in charge of the polling places at any given time shall
maintain a position of total and absolute neutrality concerning the
candidates and/or issues being voted upon, though if directly ques-
tioned, they may render their opinion.

—Under no circumstances shall any person attempt to directly
influence the vote of any student after that student has obtained his
ballot, but has not yet cast it.

The proposals are, for the most part, exactly what the doctor
ordered for the feverish actions of some electioneers and politicos at
Washington and Lee. However, we take exception to the second pro-
posal.

As it currently reads, no student body money may be spent to
advocate views on an election issue. This stems from the EC’s spend-
ing of money for a poster which essentially told students to vote no
on the proposed amendment.

However well-intentioned this proposal might be, there is one
problem which hits home hard. As currently worded, the proposal
would mean the Ring-tum Phi could not comment on the election
issues.

While some may be overjoyed at the possibilities of the proposal
as such, any rule of this sort would clearly violate the First Amend-
ment of the Constitution, which prevents Congress, and presumably
any legislative body, from abridging freedom of the press.

But beyond constitutional implications, the proposed bill is simply
not feasible. The proposal would ban editorials, editorials which (we
hope) contribute to the students’ knowledge of the issues at hand.
Furthermore, any other column or opinion would have to be edited
out of the Phi, opinion ranging from Ask Traveller to a letter to the
editor. No one could say anything about an election issue, and the
students would be left in the dark on the meaning of the issues.

The arguments could go on for days. We only ask that the EC’s
committee to study the proposal look at this section carefully, and that
it do something to prevent the possible implications of conflict with
the U.S. Constitution.

On UC representation
Sir:

In response to the editorial con-
cerning student representation on
the University Council (Ring-tum
Phi, February 7), I would like to
make a few comments.

First of all, I feel that there is
a great need for increased com-
munication between the student
body and its representatives on
the UC. You referred to the
“best interests of the students.”
But who is to say what these
interests are? It is my opinion
that the UC representatives have
been very jax in their responsi-
bility to communicate with the
students and to try to determine
how the students feel on different
issues.

ETUERS TO UE

 

bate, perhaps some information
of which the student was not
aware, Which could influence the
student’s decision.

By following this procedure,
the student representative can
gather a maximum amount of in-
put, weigh this input considering
all aspects, and then make his
final decision. However, I believe
as vou do, that a student should
not feel intimidated by what a
faculty member does or says.

The student members of the
University Council are meant to
act as a link between the student
body and the members of the
faculty and the administration.
Only if they strive to represent
the students and to inform them
of faculty opinions can they be
effective.

   

Sincerely,

©f course, 2 stiident who is :

I would guess that a significant

Ask Traveller

Q—How do you explain all the Phi Beta Kappa’s given this year when
SATs are getting progressivley lower and the average student
can’t even sing the Campbell’s Soup jingle without harassing a
housewife first?

A—Good question. What seems to be a paradoxical situation, (moral
and mental deficiency being abundantly rewarded), is really just
a Canadian stand-off, which is not a smelly lumberjack, but rather
a type of problem having any number of equally ridiculous
answers.

The most obvious answer for low scores/high grades is the
sliding scale, by which a test score may be altered to compensate
for the test-taker’s background, intelligence, shoe size, or lack
of hair. As you may know, half the inhabitants of ancient Pompei
were posthumously awarded 720’s on their Law Boards through
the modern miracle of the sliding scale. (The other half were
disqualified for flicking ash all over the floor of the test center.)

Of course, the sliding scale can work both ways. Lower SAT’s
do not necessarily mean that W&L is getting an inordinate num-
ber of Western State out-patients as new students, It may signify
that standardized tests are becoming more difficult to take and
to accurately grade, or that they are being given to more diverse
groups, or that some Education Testing Center idiot in New
Jersey hasn't gotten paid and is having some fun until he does.

Another possible reason for the spate of Gold Key winners is
the shocking amount of out-and-out booking going on at W&L.
Hard work, steady application, and a capacity for sweating
through your hair can certainly make up for a lack of native
intelligence. And that, of course, cannot be measured by stand-
ardized tests. The one thousand volumes supposedly taken each
year from McCormick Library are not being taken by dishonest
students or stealthy cadets. Those books are literally demolished
through the constant handling and scuffling by Phi Bet Kappa
hopefuls. If you don't believe me, just take a look at that human
anatomy book behind the loose ‘brick on the fifth level. Either
the preface is shredded or that’s a mighty strange-looking pelvis.

Q—Isn’t it possible that professors are just grading easier?

A—It’s a pleasant thought. But the real issue is who ripped off the
section on “The Female Figure in Motion” from behind that
loose brick. The next shipment of anatomy texts won't come in

for another month.

Inside-Out

By ROME SCOTT

“The Last Tango in Paris” recently tangoed for the last time in
many places which, in the present climate of rule by community
standards, is not surprising.

Even with all the furor created by the movie’s appearance, any-
one seeing the film as an art form wonders how people can stop
yawning long enough to protest.

Bernardo Bertoluci’s movie’s only real transgression is that it is
boring, painfully boring.

“Last Tango” is flat photographically, has little content value and
creates an annoyingly trite conflict between the surreal technique and
cinema verite. ;

The movie opens with an unshaven, wild-eyed Marlon Brando
stumbling down the streets of Paris following a morally questionable
Maria Schneider.

But she does not remain morally questionable for long. Brando
follows her to an apartment she is thinknig of renting and seduces
her (fully-clothed, no less).

From this “chance” encounter, Brando and Schneider begin meet-
ing for no other reason than to satisfy selfish sexual drives, each
having the attitude that the arrangement is a temporary thing.

At the outset Brando is dominant, distant and unconcerned about
the girl’s emotional needs or wants but, as the film progresses, he
becomes emotionally involved himself.

As soon as he becomes involved, the girl begins to reject him until,
by the end of the film, he is chasing her all over Paris.

The chase ends with Schneider shooting Brando in a ritualistic,
slow motion scene meant to give the event impact. Rather than
impact, the viewer feels a sense of relief saying to himself, “I sat
through this whole thing for that?”

The color photography is done with flat lighting throughout
except when Schneider is being filmed in a series of art movies
which is the way she earns her living. Then the colors become vivid
but the technique becomes surrealistic and loses its immediacy.

The plot line is put forth on a constant “so what” level with no

climaxes in action unless one considers the shooting at the end
climactic.

  

 

eae

Bertolucci meant the movie to convey feelings of dispair, desola-
tion, and life lacking direction—the state of being portrayed by
Brando driven to folly by the death of his wife, an event never made
clear in “Last Tango.”

The film does convey these feelings well but does so with such
constancy that the viewer becomes numb to the sensation half way
through and by the end has lost sight of the film’s intent.

For this reason the end comes as a relief but not the tension
relaxing, sighing relief found at the end of an action film. Instead,
the relief is the type one experiences when being let out of a closet
he has been trapped in for two hours,

One leaves the theater glad to be alive after having the distinct
feeling of having been associated with death for a long evening at
the movies.

If boredom were a cause of death “Last Tango’s” rating would
read “Caution: this movie may be hazardous to your health,” How-
ever, it does not appeal to one’s prurient interests: it just does not
appeal to any interests at all,

1916 seems to be the first vear
of the theme balls. That year,
the immortal Reuben A. Lewis

“an intricate figure which lasted
half an hour.” Miss White was
still around then. She dressed as
Marie Antoinette. Many others
came in court costumes. The Bal

was moved from the middle of
February to the end of January.
The Faney Dress Ball became
entrenched as a between semester

In the next two decades the
ball reached its zenith of popu-

Generals up season record,
ast home game Saturday

By BILL FLESHER

In case you haven't noticed,
Washington and Lee’s basketball
Generals are doing what many
considered impossible — pulling

another winning season.

The Blue have upped their sea-
son mark to 10-11 at press time,
and can give Verne Canfield his
eighth straight winner with wins
in their final three games.

Under the circumstances a win-
ning season would be quite an ac-
complishment, especially when
you ey back at the General’s
dismal 2-7 record in mid-January.

The a for a winning
season looked shaky at times dur-
ing the past two weeks. However
W&L played two super second
halves to pull out wins over Lynch-
burg and York, gave fifth-ranked
O'd Dominion fits in Norfolk be-
fore losing by only nine, and did
what they had to in downing a
scrappy Emory and Henry outfit.

Lynchburg coach Wayne Profitt
(vou. remember him, he’s the
coach who’d rather beat W&L
than eat) didn’t want to face
reality after his Hornets took a
97-67 pounding from Wé&L in
Doremus Gym Feb. 5.

\V&L’s man-to-man defense took
the Hornets out of their offensive
patterns, caused numerous turn-
overs, and opened the way for the
Generals’ fast break, which didn’t
even exist in the first half.

Trailing 387-36 at intermission,
W&L ran lLynehburg off the
court in the second 20 minutes.

When the smoke had cleared, and
after the last of many whistles
(51 fouls were called) was sound-
ed, the Generals had gained re-
venge for the 81-78 loss suffered
in Lynchburg back in December.

The 61 second-half points
amounted to the highest one-half
output for W&L this season. John
Podgajnv led four W&L players
in double-figures with 20 points.
Fi Lichtivies added 17, Is 1
the second-half, while Jerry
Porath and Paul Maloney chipped
in 12 and 10 each.

The Generals’ minds seemed to
be anywhere but Doremus Gym
Feb. 8 when a winless York Col-
lege squad invaded Lexington.

The Spartans, however, were
there in every way, and were out
for a win.

W&L again played a_ sloppy
first half, so sloppy that one had
to wonder if they would even
score against Old Dominion the
next night. Again they trailed at
halftime 39-33.

Whatever Canfield said in the
locker room had some effect, as
a totally different ball club ap-
peared for the second half.
Though not at their sharpest, the
Generals played solidly in the
second half, working the fast
break to produce 60 points in the
final period,

York gutted it out, but couldn’t
hold down W&L’s fast break, and
returned home still winless, the
final score 93-77.

A man called Cosell

By BILL AUSTIN
Ring-tum Phi Sports Editor
The times are strange indeed.

f examples to support this claim

are needed, cast a furtive glance

at this past weekend’s college
basketball scores, and gawk at
the defeats which have loosened
the West Coast’s grip upon top
rankings. Better yet, scan reput-
able best-seller lists, and discover

a sportscaster’s recollections a-

mong the current giants of non-

fictional literature.

The coin-collecting book is
Howard Cosell’s aptly titled Co-
sell, a work which combines auto-
biographical insights with hope-
fully controversial opinions about
the game and figures of sport.

NOTICE

Due to rising student complaints
about the availability of Doremus
Gym facilities, and the need to
cut down on equipment and
locker room theft, all persons us-

ing Doremus must present a
Washington and Lee identifica-

tion card before they will be ad-
mitted.

On weekends and in the eve-
ning after 6 p.m. only the main
door leading to the athletic de-
partment offices will be open. All

other doors will be locked.
If you have lost your ID card
ehneck with Dean John’s office

avout securing a replacement.

=

Cosell’s themes are few, yet per-
sistent.

Included is his absessive yearn-
ing to become more than merely
another likeable, predictable
broadcaster, one offering verbal
pablum to hordes of complacent
fans. Then there is his remembr-
ance of the early TV years of
his career, when powerful ABC
executives conspired to keep his
assured smirk and barbed tongue
off the air.

Quite simply, Howard Cosell
fancies himself a crusader, one
who has abbrasively upheld the
integrity of his convictions in the
face of stormy protests. Finally,
as in any success story, there is
the elevation to Tube stardom.
Due credit is given to his drawl-
ing foil, Meredith, but the ob-
servant reader never forgets that
Mr. Cosell knows the game.

Is it a bit disturbing that a
shrewd, articulate TV color man
and boxing analyst can transform
his cocation into an activity of
self-acknowledged courage? Upon
this question rests a portion of
any reader’s enjoyment, and much
of Cosell’s credibility. Not that
the author has any doubts. At
one point, he mentions a desire
to serve in the United States
Senate.

Polities aside, Cosell is at his
best when he journalistically pe-
ruses the sporting scene. His
summaries of recent Olympics

Generals move toward .500 record

(Continued from page 6)
many as 15 late in the game.

Employing a tight man-to-man
defense, W&L took away the fear-
ed ODU fast break, and even
showed Monarch coach Sonny
Allen a few things about “run-
ning and gunning.”

Wé&L trailed by only one at
halftime (33-32). In facet, they
led for several brief preiods in
the first half.

Lichtfuss scored 26 _ points,
grabbed 11 rebounds, had four
steals, and did a superb defensive

job on All-American candidate
Copeland. Copeland, for whom
ODU turned on the ceremonies,

got 22 points, five below his aver-

age,

W&L again inched closer to the
elusive .600 mark last Wednes-
day with a 74-61 win over Emory
and Henry.

The win was the first road vic-
torv for the Generals this season.
W&L had come up short six times
previous on foreign hardwood in
1973-74.

Lichtfuss again paced W&L
scorers with 22 points, while
Podgajny added 18.

W&L started toward Farmville
Saturday afternoon for a rematch
with Hampden-Sydney. However
the roads were a bit too slick to
travel due to a heavy snow, So,
the game was postponed until
Monday, Feb. 25.

W&L carried a 10-11 slate into
last night’s game with the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh-Johnstown.
Up and coming are Saturday’s
home finale with Grove City Col-
lege (Doremus Gym, 8 p.m.) and
the rescheduled Hampden-Sydney
rematch next Monday.

Wrestlers fall to 7-9-1

The Washington and Lee
wrestlers saw their record dip
below the .500 level for the first
time last week by losing a pair
of dual meets.

The Generals are now 7-9-1
after losing close meets Saturday
to Virginia Commonwealth 24-18
and Frostburg 26-41. -Wé&L's
wrestlers showed the effects of
last Thursday’s Virginia College
Athletic Association (VCAA) tour-
nament, in which they placed
second among seven teams. Team

bunch, Following these top two
units were, in order, William and
Mary, Richmond and VMI.

For W&L, Tad Van Lier man-
aged a third place finish in the
100-vard free-style event, the top
General performance of the meet.
In addition, he captured a sixth
in the 200-yard free-style (his
first effort at that distance this
season) and a ninth in the 50-
vard free-style, an effort hurt by
two bad starts.

Robbie Searles also performed
notably, nabbing a pair of fourths
in the 100 and 200-yard  back-
strokes, and a seventh in the 200-
vard individual medley.

Porter McNeil dropped 10 sec-
onds from his previous best time
to capture seventh in the 500-
yard free-style, while Bill Tiers
garnered a tenth place finish in
the same event.

For the Generals, the meet
closed the 1975-74 season on a
less than satisfying note. No
swimmers qualified time-wise for
this year’s National competition.

The team’s 6-3 won-lost mark,
though a respectable achievement
in this, a tough winter season for
W&L sports, was nevertheless
tainted by defeat at the hands of
arch-rival VMI in a mid-season
encounter. To be sure, a measure
of pride was reclaimed in the im-
pressive triumph over William
and Marv a few weeks ago.

Quartet here Friday

The Fine Arts String Quartet,
one of America’s foremost groups
of its type, will present a con-
cert Friday in Lee Chapel.

The 8 p.m. program is sponsor:
ed by the Washington and Lee
Concert Guild.

All faculty members and _ art-
ists-in-residents at the University
of Milwaukee, the musicians have
performed extensively in Europe
and America, and they appear
frequently on both commercial
and public television.

The Quartet’s Lexington con-
cert will feature the music of
Haydn, Lutostowsky and Bartok.

In addition to its extensive
touring activity, the Fine Arts
Quartet has established an an-
nual concert series in Chicago

which has become one of Ameri
ca’s most significant sounding
hoards for chamber music. Its
“Summer Evenings of Music”
series in Milwaukee has attracted
artists from throughout the coun-
Ley,

The performers use rare and
exquisite antique instruments—a
243-vear-old first violin made by
Guarnerius del Gesu, a 204-year-
old second violin by Balestrieri,
a 226-vear-old viola crafted by
Carcassi in Florence, and a 243-

Goffriller.

The pages devoted to boxers
may comprise Cosell’s finest writ-
ing. His long-term friendship with
Muhammad Ali is rehashed along
with his championing of Ali’s
legal innocence in the days when
such a stance was immensely un-
popular. Joe Frazier is viewed
respectfully: a simple, brave man
who has resented Ali’s sway over

the populace.

George Foreman, it seems, was
a Cosell “find”, having gained his
attention with a display of con-
siderable skills in the 1968 Olymp-
ics. Yes, Humble Howard even
proclaimed Frazier’s dethroning
before Foreman met and belted
him in January, 1973.

Cosell’s attitude toward Floyd
Patterson proves particularly in-
teresting, disturbing. He called
himself a staunch Patterson fan
in the early stages of his boxing
career, and even held a persona!
friendship with the moody, com-
pina fighter. Yet, after Patter-
son’s humiliating losses to Liston,
when he had fallen from title
contention status to that of an
aging, oft’ beaten has-been, Pat-
terson became for Cosell a con-
temptible figure, wallowing in
self-martyrization and sympathy.

Other figures also taste the
author’s ire. He labels Casey
Stengel “rude, crude, and uncul-
tured.” Sonny Liston, apparently
not spared by death, was “a bad
apple ...a cheap and ugly bully
without morality.” Not surpris-
ingly, neither man was especially
enamored with Cosell, either.

lectures. The audience will have
the opportunity to examine the
prints individually, and a ques.

take place.

Students pass amendment

(Continued from page 1)
criticized the “totally undemo-
cratic” process of counting votes
before the election was concluded.

Along the same lines, one EC
member raised objections to last
issue’s Ring-tum Phi letter en-
titled “The EC’s Side.” He felt
that it made the EC look as if
it was fighting the amendment.

As a solution to the problem
surrounding the election, never:
theless, it was brought up that a
committee be appointed in order
to work on the problems and re-
port their results back to the EC

Psychologist available

(Continued from page 4)

Dr. Worth is carrying out ex.
periments now with the Psycho-
logica Stress Evaluator, which
measures stress in the human
voice. For this purpose he has

received a Sloan Research Grant

He and his lab assistant, Mr.
Bernie Lewis, a senior psychology
major at W&L, are contributing
some original research to this
field.

Dr. Worth encourages students
to come to his office, on the first
floor of the Student Center and
“walk in if the door is open. If
the door is closed, sign the
schedule sheet on my door for an
hour or a half-hour with any
initials you choose to use.” His
phone is extension 282, and he
can be contacted through the uni-
versity receptionist at extension
299. He again expressed the ab-
solute confidentiality of his help,
and said that the purpose of his
couseling is “to facilitate prol
lem solving, to promote a greater
sense of satisfaction in living and
to reduce painful emotions such
as depression and anxiety.”
