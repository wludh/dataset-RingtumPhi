Founders’ Day activities Monday

Supreme Court Justice Lewis F.
Powell Jr. will be the speaker
Monday at the traditional Lee’s
3irthday and Founders’ Day con-
vocation at Washington and Lee.

Powell will speak at 11 a.m. in
Evans Hall. The public is invited
to attend the convocation and

Justice Powell’s address.

Powel learned both his under-
graduate and law degrees from
Washington and Lee and has
been a member of its Board of
Trustees since 1961. He was presi-
dent of the American Bar Associa-
tion in 1964-65.

Student kills himself

in fraternity house

Michael Wayne McWhirter, 19,
a sophomore at Washington and
Lee, died Saturday of a self-in-
flicted gunshot wound, according
to Rockbridge County Medical
Examiner E. V. Brush.

McWhirter, of Chamblee, Ga.,
died at the Psi Upsilon fraternity
house on East Nelson Street.
Police say McWhirter locked him-
self in his room between 2 and 3
p.m. Saturday and committed sui-
cide. His body was discovered by

other members of the house. A
note was found by the body.
Police have not released the con-
tents of the note.

MeWhirter’s death marks the
third suicide of a Washington and
Lee student in the past three
school years. One student took his
life at his home in Rockbridge

County two years ago, while
another committed suicide last
vear in the Beta Theta Pi fra-
ternity house on North Jefferson
Street.

 

No one can define that com-
plex of emotions which causes
a man to take his own life.
Mike McWhirter surely had
his reasons, though he chose
to bear them by himself. His
death was thus as much as a
shock to his fraternity brothers

 

as it was to his parents and
friends. Although we knew
Mike for but two vears, he has
left behind him a memory and
a love which will remain with
us all the days of our lives.

EC schedules referendum
on limiting closed sesstons

By ROBERT PUGH

Next month the student body
will vote on opening up every EC
meeting which does not involve
a possible honor violation.

Senior Ted Amshoff submitted
a petition signed by more than
100 people. The amendment would
forbid the EC to meet in a closed
session except about possible
honor violations. Amshoff insist-
ed that the petition was not
aimed at the present EC.

The student body constitution
permits amendments to be sub-
mitted by a petition signed by 50
Feb. 7, 8, and 11. Approval by
students. The vote will be held
two-thirds of the voters and a
turnout of 50% of the student
body is required, The vote will be
held on a Thursday, Friday, and
Monday.

Student Body President Doug
Schwartz reported on last week-
end’s Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Board

of Trustees meeting which he at-
tended.

The Board seemed highly en-
thusiastic about a new Fine Arts
building after the new library is
built. They plan to tour the pres-
ent Fine Arts facilities in May
when they have their next Board
meeting.

Curriculum Committee  chair-
man Herb Rubenstein announced
an Asian Studies Information Pro-
gram Jan. 29, which will involve
discussion of the Asian spring
courses. There will be a meeting
in Mareh about independent ma-
jors. The Committee plans to have
another curriculum survey next
month. The format will be chang-
ed to increase participation.

In other business, Schwartz an-
nounced that the infirmary situa-
tion will be discussed at the next
University Council meeting. Also,
the concert with Charlie Daniels
has been canceled.

Coinciding with the university’s
observance of Lee’s Birthday and
Founders’ Day will be the annual
“tapping” ceremonies for Omicron
Delta Kappa, national honorary
leadership fraternity. ODK was
established at Washington and
Lee in 1914, and now there are
chapters on the campuses of more
than 100 colleges and universities
in America. Rupert N. Latture,

one of ODK’s founders and now
an aide to Washington and Lee
President Robert E. R. Huntley,
will participate in the “tap” cere-
monies.

Lewis F. Powell III, son of
Justice Powell and a senior at
Washington and Lee this year, is
president of the W&L chapter of
ODK.

 

Applications are currently
being accepted by the Publica-
tions Board for the position of
editor-in-chief of the Ring-tum
Phi for a one-year appoint-
ment from January, 1974 to
January, 1975.

Election will take place
Tuesday, Jan. 22, in the Publi-
cations Board office in the Uni-
versity Center. The Publica-
tions Board will meet at 7:00
p.m. in the University Center.

Applications for the position
should include:

 

—a brief letter of intent;

—a personal resume (ap-
proximately 10 copies) contain-
ing academic and extracurricu-
lar data and information perti-
nent to employment on vari-
ous publications. The resume
should be in outline form.

The personal appearance be-
fore the board is expected to
be brief. Presentations of
plans, thoughts, and proposals
may be made in written out-
line.

 

 

Fine arts discussed by trustees

Last weekend, when the Board
of Trustees met in Tuscaloosa,
Alabama, Doug Schwartz, Presi-
dent of the Student Body, was
there to represent the views of
the students.

The main thrust of Schwartz’s
presentation was to impress upon
the Board the real need for a
fine arts center at W&L to house
facilities for music, art, and
drama. He said that a moderniza-
tion and adaptation of existing
building was not enough and
that the Board should think in
terms of building a completely
new facility.

Schwartz enumerated the rea-
sons why he felt such a fine arts
complex is necessary:

1) Each discipline, music, art,
and drama, require modernized
facilities which should not have
to be shared with other disci-
plines. For example, student con-
cert groups should not have to
use a room which doubles as a
classroom for music courses.

2) The housing of these three
departments in one complex
would would allow for the neces-
sary inter-play of the arts.

3) Larger and better facilities
should be made available to
alleviate the overly crowded con-
ditions which now exist. Import-
ant here is guaranteeing non-ma-
jors the exposure to the arts they
desire and not cutting them out

of courses because of a lack of
room.

4.) Such a complex would im.
prove the visual education of the
student body in the arts.

More could be done in terms of
concerts, exhibitions and theatre
with new and expanded quarters.

5) A fine arts center would be
a meeting place for the uni-
versity community. Besides in-
creasing the unity of the school
it would tend to unify W&L with
the town and VMI.

Schwartz cited the large in-
crease in the number of students
enrolled in fine arts courses in
the past few years as an addi-
tional factor to be considered. He
said that he hoped that the Trus-
tees would make the building of
a fine arts center a high priority.
He suggested the possibility that
it be their next consideration afte:
the funds for the library are
obtained.

The Board did not respond with
a concrete motion or statement,
but Schwartz feels optimistic that
action may be taken this spring.

Schwartz also suggested that
the Board of Trustees take a tout
of the present fine arts facilities
when they come here for thei
spring meeting. This tour will be
conducted by the fine arts fac-
ulty. To this suggestion the Board
agreed enthusiastically.

THE RING- TUM PHI

|OuTLOoK and REVIEW
On closed EC meetings (again)

Early last October, we asked the Executive Committee to draw
up a constitutional amendment which would limit closed sessions of
that body to discussion of possible honor violations. We were answer:
ed with a flat “no.”

 

 

Without any such amendment, the EC could ostensibly call a
closed session for discussion of any topic it wanted, say, the student
body budget, for example, or the Honor System.

But the EC would have nothing of the sort, and instead proposed
a weak amendment stating that it would take at least three members
of the EC to call a closed session.

So what? Those three could still call a closed session on, say,
the budget or the Honor System.

The amendment, listed as a “controversial amendment,” was
defeated in October in a constitutional referendum, a referendum
which, strangely enough, seemed to be extended for a long enough
period of time so that the main body of the revised constitution—
revised by the EC, by the way—could pass,

Whatever the case, the amendment failed, and, though we were
one of the proponents of limitations on the EC’s powers to call
closed sessions, we welcomed the defeat, for the EC’s proposal was
a victory on paper only. Little would have been gained by its passage.

Instead, the defeat caused proponents of a limitation on closed
sessions to regroup and wait for the right time to try again. That
time, apparently, has come.

Last week in this column, we noted that several changes in
the Honor System and honor trial procedure had been made by the
EC, The changes were made last spring, when the newly-elected EC
members met almost nightly to discuss the upcoming school year.

While we must applaud that group for its efforts in preparing
for its term of office this year, we also must condemn its apparent
over-zealousness. Without any input whatsoever from the student
body, bureaucrats in the EC room managed to make some significant
changes in the Honor System and trial procedure, some significant
changes which we doubt are to the benefit of the student body and
the accused in an honor trial.

In essence, that the changes were made without any student
input means that the decisions were made in a closed EC session.
All decisions were those of the whims of one small group of students
assuming that they knew what would be best for the student body.

(What particularly disturbs us is that, at the time the EC changed
the Honor System, newly-elected members were not even officially
in office. The student body constitution, which we presume the EC
has read, states in Section II, paragraph C: “Officers shall enter upon
their duties the day after Commencement following their election.”
Those changes in the Honor System were made by a group of stu-
dents who weren’t even officially in office yet, except for those
members who had been re-elected. If the EC can change the Honor
System behind closed doors in an unofficial capacity, imagine what
it could do behind closed doors in an official capacity.)

But strangely, since that editorial of last week, the EC has
apparently seen the light in the open door. Monday, several students
drew up a petition of more than 50 signatures, in accordance with
the constitution, asking for an amendment limiting closed sessions to
discussion of possible honor violations. (See page 1).

And, although there is nothing the EC could do about that
amendment anyway, the members of that committee accepted the
petition and set a referendum for February 7, 8, and 11 (Feb. 9 and
10 are on a weekend).

It appears the EC has changed its position remarkably on closed
meetings within just a few short months. We must wonder why.
But whether the EC is in favor of the new amendment is not the
question. Rather, are the students in favor? We think they should be.
And, for the sake of the students, we hope we are right when the
amendment comes up for a vote in three weeks.
—P.J.L.

It’s never too late

A little item of interest we thought we’d pass on to you:

Seems a former student erred in his bookkeeping abilities while
he was here at Washington and Lee. For last week in the mail, Mrs.
Betty Munger, manager of the bookstore, received a note and $10
from an anonymous source, The note reads:

It has been requested that the enclosed $10.00 be forwarded to
you by a person desiring to remain anonymous to cover a very small
error made many years ago. It is stated that this amount includes
adequate interest. Please include this in your current store receipts.

Chalk up one for the good guys.

Ask Traveller

Q—Is it my imagination or is there some sort of secret fraternity
here at W&L in which the members wear an identifying costume
around campus?

A—Yes, and it’s called the South, an obscure name shrouded in
mysterious mumbo-jumbo, evidently referring to the geographical
area below Cleveland, Ohio, and a bit to the right. Strange hand-
shakes and passwords abound in this regional edition of the
Odd Fellows, such as the enigmatic “ya’ll” and the baffling “fat
city” in which the speaker grins widely and checks behind his
ears for spanish moss.

Social customs vary among the fellowship, but nearly always
include a stiff drink, a wilting blond, and an entertaining imita-
tion of the Delta Queen whistling for more steam on the Missis-
sippi. Folk dance, too, plays an important part in the life of the
fraternity, lending credence to the legendary boast that any three
“Southern” hoofers can stomp a trillion challengers in a fair
gatoring contest as long as the temperature stays above seventy
and the floor is kept wet with grain and sorghum.

But the most obvious aspect of this secret brotherhood, in-
deed, is the distinctive dress, styled with the predictable elegance
of Ma and Pa Kettle in Paris and the functional simplicity of a
Victorian brothel. Roughly, the characteristic outfit consists of
a pair of topsiders (or banana hoppers as the Bolivians call them),
a pair of belted, cuffed khaki pants with or without dark fluff
socks beneath them.

Depending on the season, red alligator T-shirts are worn inter-
changeably with blue work shirts and plaid jackets. For the more
formal occassion a long white, button-downed dress shirt and
blue-crested blazer are worn with a hand-painted neck tie show-
ing Sherman insulting Clark Gable.

This basic pattern, traditional ever since the Centennial failed
at Gettysburg, persists in the South in spite of the double knit
influence, although reports indicate progressive change has
occurred in the wearing of khakis over the head with the knees
cut out for eye holes when placing an order for rooster heads
at Kentucky Fried Chicken.

Remember this, though. To merely dress like one of “them”
will not gain you entrance into the secret cult of the South, whose
jocal headquarters is purported to be in the backroom of David-
sons. More is required.

Q—What?

A—A ‘c’ average in American history.

Inside-Out

  

By ROME SCOTT

And now, down to business.

Will the real reason for mak-
ing “The Paper Chase” please
stand up?

Voted the best entertainment
picture of the year by many
critics, let’s hope those who see
it believe it was just entertain-
ment.

“The Paper Chase,” starring
Timothy Bottoms as a first year
man at Harvard law school, is
the product of Jim Bridges (if
one man can get the credit for
a movie these days).

Bridges wrote the screen play
and directed the flick which was
a series of moviettes about the
trials and tribuations of making
the grade in law school.

Bottoms comes to Harvard
where Professor Kingsfield, his
idol, teaches law. Bottoms, as
voung Hart, is innocently taking
a break from the rigors of aca-
demia to go get a pizza one night
when he runs into, of all things,
a girl.

The girl is sure she’s being fol-
lowed (of course!) and Hart gal-
lantly agrees to walk her home.
She doesn’t ask him in that night
but next time (you guessed it)
he ends up in bed with her.

He tells her all about his de-
sire to be recognized by the great
Professor Kingsfield and his
theories about how to gain this
recognition.

Little does Hart know that this
girl he has accidently run into
on the streets of Boston (not a
small town at that) is the daugh-
ter of Kingsfield (believable,
huh?).

Well, Miss Kingsfield is really
Mrs. somebody who is waiting for
a divorce (so everything is all
right). Hart eventually asks her
to marry him, or something like
that, but she says that’s no good
(the viewer never gets a clear
picture of why).

Hart then says that he has to
have some kind of arrangement
because he’s got to keep his life
organized.

They reach no agreement and
we find Hart standing in front
of Kingsfield’s class trying not to
be a conformist (we are led to
believe this is what Kingsfield’s
daughter is getting at).

Hart, like a true student (oh,
veah) tells Kingsfield, “You’re a
son-of-a-biteh.”

And then (miracle of miracles)
Kingsfield tells Hart he can stay
in class.

Hart is jubilant (who wouldn’t
be?) and feels he has made it—
Kingsfield has recognized him.
(don’t believe a word of it).

Final examination comes and,
on the way out of the building,
Hart runs into Kingsfield. After
telling the great professor how
much his class has meant to him,
Hart finds that Kingsfield doesn’t
know who Hart is.

Shattered ego and_ slumped
shoulders, Hart fades out and we
see his exam graded (Would you

   

believe an A?).

Finally we see Hart lounging
on a beach as the  professor’s
daughter brings him the envelope
with his grade.

Does Hart anxiously open it
to see what all the backbreaking
work has gotten him? Of course
Hee, is

He ceremoniously makes a
paper airplane out of the en-
velope and sails it out to sea
(Hart has arrived).

Fadeout, music, credits, cur-
tain. Over, finished and what
have we seen?

If the public is expected to take
the plot seriously, and there is
a rumor that Bridges meant for
it to be taken seriously, then the
picture is a joke, a soap opera
with a new twist.

New twist or not, the plot is
still an old lemon.

If the movie was made with-
out a motive, other than to en-
tertain, then hurray, hurray, hur-
ray—it is funny.

With other critics screaming
for relevance and meaning, I’m
asking for a lack of meaning. All
I want out of “The Paper Chase”
is entertainment.

Good thing too—that’s all it has
to give.

The decline of Miss M.

BETTE MIDLER
Atlantic SD 7270
By JOHN ZAMOISKI

Somehow, I get the feeling that
Bette Midler’s second album was
put out solely for the purpose of
putting out a second album, One
listening is enough for anyone’s
ear to reinforce the decision that
the Divine Miss M. has lost her
way. The lack of life and style
is everpresent.

To say the least, Bette Midler’s
first album was great. She was
able to combine two separate and
seemingly incompatable styles in-
to one cohesive sound experience.
A marriage of blues—emotional
ballads and upbeat camp sounds
worked beautifully.

This new collection is a big dis-
appointment. Side one starts off
fairly well. If you haven’t heard
Bette’s first album, you can ex-
cuse side one as being a good
first attempt at the big time.
“Skylark” has a lack of emotion
strangling what could have been
a moving song.

NOTICE
DORMITORY COUNSELORS 1974-75
Applications are invited for the position of Freshman and
Upperclass Dormitory Counselors for the 1974-75 academic year.
These positions are considered to be among the most responsible
entrusted to Washington and Lee students.

On the basis of past experience, certain guidelines for the |

selection of Dormitory Councelors have been established. Appli-
cants must be at least current sophomores, and should not
have routine commitments after 8 p.m. that would normally
take them from the dormitory for any appreciable time. While
counselorships are not awarded on an academic basis, a student
who has failed to maintain a 2.0 average would probably not
be selected. Any counselor who is placed on Academic Probation
after being selected will be asked to resign.

In order to insure their greatest possible availability to
counselees, counselors, are provided with a single room in the
dormitory and with the dinner meal, which they are expected
to eat in Evans Dining Hall. Each counselor will also be ex-
pected to live in his dormitory room seven nights a week and
cannot have an off-campus apartment.

The primary basis for selection of counselors to freshmen
will be their general fitness to aid in making the dormitories a
suitable environment for a student’s freshman year.

Students who are presently dormitory counselors and who
wish to reapply for next year should submit letters to this

 

effect to the Dean of Students’ office by 4 p.m. on Friday, |
January 25. In addition, returning counselors should indicate in °
their letter if they wish to apply for Head Counselor or As-

sistant Head Counselor.

New applicants for counselor positions in the freshman and
upperclass dormitories should submit letters to this effect to
the Dean of Students’ office by 4 p.m. on Friday, January 25.
Such applications should contain information that will be help-
ful to the Selection Committee, including previous counseling
experience and the reasons for wanting the position. Further
details concerning duties and responsibilities can be obtained
from Floyd Lewis, Head Dormitory Counselor, and Gary Avery,
Paul Cavaliere, Rolf Piranian and David Turk, Assistant Head
Dormitory Counselors, each of whom is a member of the Selec-
tion Committee. All applicants for counselor positions will be
interviewed by a committee composed of the Head Dormitory
Counselor, the Assistant Head Dormitory Counsehlors and the
Associate Dean of Students. Applicant will be notified by mail
of the time for interviews after January 25,

 

“Drinking Again” probably
ranks as the most intelligible and
enjoyable selection on the album,
With more sensitivity than any
of the other cuts, “Drinking
Again” is the disc’s one redeem-
ing value. “Surabaya Johnny” is
a four minute and fifty-two sec-
ond preview of the type of non-
sense the listener will be sub-
jected to on. side two. It’s a
talking cut that would have been
better off looking for aid in a
welfare line. It won’t get any sup-
port from this listener.

We finish side one with “I
Shall Be Released.” As long as
you don’t know that Bob Dylan
wrote it and you haven't heard
Dylan’s rendition, you can enjoy
this song. Otherwise, don’t bother
to listen. In contrast with the
original, it’s slow and cumber-
some.

Side two is coated with dreams
of songs of the past. Unfortun.
ately, they come of fas night-
mares. The “Boogie-Woogie-Bugle-
Boy” that brought Miss M.’s tal-
ent to the attention of the public
was cute and snap.

But, you can’t base half an
album on a one shot fad. “Lullaby
of Broadway” and “In the Mood”
should have been left where they
belong; in the past. The same
goes for “Da-Doo-Rum-Rum” and
“Higher and Higher.” Without a
stage show to accompany them,
these songs drift without direc.
tion.

Hopefully, Miss M. will find
her way and offer an apology to
her public by releasing a third
album that will rate being called
her second album. The sooner we
put this one in the past, the
better.

National Shakespeare Company

‘As You Like It’ set Friday

The National Shakespeare Com-
pany’s production of “As You
Like It” will be presented in
Doremus Gymnasium Friday at
& p.m.

Tickets for the play are $2.00
in advance and $2.50 at the door.
The play is beng sponsored by
the Washington and Lee Student
Activities Board.

The plot of “As You Like It”
involves a banished ruler, Duke
Senior, his daughter Rosalind, her
lover, Orlando, and a host of

other characters whose lives all
become intwined in the Forest
of Arden. The major development
of the story are unfolded early
and the rest of the play takes
place in the forest as the lovers
create problems for themselves.
Indeed, there is very little real
change in the situation between
the first act and the last.

The play concerns itself mainly
with the confusion of love.
Rosalind disguises herself as a
man so that she may observe her

Thursday, January 17, 1974

lover and in doing so becomes
the object of a country girl’s love.

At the begining of the play the
favors of the world seem to be
distributed to the wrong people.
The good Duke Senior is banished
by his brother, the usurper Duke
Frederick. Rosalind is banished
because her uncle fears that her
popularity may be dangerous to
him.

Orlando runs away from his
brother Oliver who, being the
elder, has inherited their father’s

estates and mistreats his younger
brother. The fortunes of these
characters are reversed by coin-
cidences and near miracles in the
end when the villains repent.

The story is anything but real-
istic but, then again, it is not
intended to be. The plot is only
a necessary evil which is used to
frame the comic situations aris-
ing in the forest. In the end,
things fall into place rapidly and
several couples are married to
live happily ever after.

‘Man of Mode’ opens Saturday as
W&L theatre presentation here

By BILL AUSTIN
This Saturday night at 8 p.m.,
the University Theatre presents
Sir George Etheridge’s “The Man
of Mode.”

The play, considered one of the
comic masterpieces of the seven-
teenth-century, focuses upon hu-
man posturings and cunning in
a world which has forfeited its
moral sustances, its tenets of in-
visible order.

The work’s killer-hero, Dorimant
serves no loftier cause than the
satisfying of his own sexual
needs. In his powerful use of
language and in his animal vigor,
Dorimant dominates weaker crea-
tures which surround him. One
example is his friend Medley, who
observes folly and love with de-

tached cleverness, but can not
enter into the experience of life
himself.

Dorimant also feasts off the
vulnerability of women. Mrs.
Loveit and Bellinda both condemn
him for his heartless treatment,
but give themselves regardless,
willing sacrifices to his danger-
ous wiles of seduction.

Only Harriet offers a serious
challenge to Dorimant’s life style
of self-satisfying one-night stands.
When he croons loving words,
she mocks him for his superficial
emotions. Intrigued, love-struck,
Dorimant realizes that this beauty
cannot be his unless he is willing
to give of himself, his loyalty.

In contrast, Young Bellair’s en-
during love for Emilia seems to
evidence the possibility for a
match of beings in the marriage
contract, though the two are ever
mindful of the difficulties involv-
ed. Bellair’s goat-like father com-
plicates matters when he desires
Emilia for himself, but his chal-
lenge is overcome through decep-
tion.

The play’s exuberant moments
of humor are fueled, in large
measure, by the figure of Sir
Fopling Flutter, the epitomy of
the fashionable man. He embod-
ies everything that the age pur-
ports to embrace, for he is totally
external, wholly visible to the
eye. Any inner life has been ex-
changed for complete, slavish de-
votion to reigning modes of taste.
Consequently, Sir Fopling amuses,
appalls his fellows and the audi-
ence alike.

Etheridge’s “Man” makes for

brilliant, staccato-paced entertain-
ment today, for his characters
possess a fullness of dimension
which survives the passing of 4
particular epoch. Moreover, they
hold, amid the frivolity, an under-
lying recognition of their society’s
verging on destructive chaos. This
bit of trauma-inspiring wisdom
haunts them, as it surely must
us in our own fragmented age.

The play will continue through
Wednesday.

Thursday, January 17, 1974

By HERB RUBENSTEIN

During October of last semester,
the Student Curriculum Commit-
tee initiated a student survey for
both freshmen and upper class-
men. This survey included a
course by course evaluation as
well as a general survey of stu-
dent opinion in such areas as
distribution requirements, PE
requirements, new courses, and
suggestions for improving the
curriculum at W&L.

One of the most widespread
complaints showing up was the
feeling that P.E. should not be
required, About 65% of the stu-
dent body thought that the PE
requirements is unneccessary and
that a less structured PE pro-
gram should be introduced. The
students on the other hand gave
hearty approval of the distribu-
tion requirements with over 75%
of the students approving. The
only objections raised were that
some courses such as computer
science, accounting, journalism,
engineering, and comp. literture
were considered solely as electives
and could not be used in one of
the four areas satisfying distribu-
tion requirements.

The students also approved of
the 12-12-6 calendar instituted in
1970-71. Nearly 90% of the stu-
dents approved of the new pro-
gram which is also favored by a
majority of the faculty. The only
area that students were not happy
vith was the lack of availability

~

of internship possibilities and the
limited number of courses offered
in the spring. Since he survey
was. distributed, several new
courses have been planned plus,
6-week study abroad courses have
been set up in England, the Far
East, Italy, and other countries.
Department heads in Journalism,
Commerce, and other departments
are working on increasing the
possibilities for students to take
off-campus study-work opportuni-
ties in the spring.

Another major area where stu-
dents lodged many complaints
was that fine arts facilities. The
Troubador Theater was consider-
ed by many as being not adequate
for the needs of the drama de-
partment, and should be replac-
ed. Several students also com-
plained the drawing and sculpting
facilities were crowded and should
be enlarged. Students of music
registered many complaints as to
the music listening facilities in
McCormick Library. With the
quickly growing enrollment in
Fine Arts courses, the lack of
facilities in music and the other
fine arts programs has caused the
students many problems and
should be remedied by the ad-
ministration in the very near
future.

The freshman survey turned up
a few surprising results. Even
though the survey was taken
nearly two months after fresh-
men arrived on the W&L campus,

Curriculum survey study released

82% of the freshman class were
not familar with the process
necessary for an independent ma-
jor. 34% of the class stated it was
interested in such a major and
wanted to find out more about
the program.

Freshmen also turned back the
PE requirement with 55% of the
class voting against it. Strong
approval was given to the 12-12-6
calendar with 96% in approval.

During the questionnaire each
student was asked to fill out sur-
veys for courses he had taken in
the last two vears. The data we
have received from this survey
is not complete enough to form
any overall student opinion as to
specific courses. However, Drs.
Gunn, Hughes, and _ Coulling,
among others, were given much
praise, and with few exceptions
the faculty was considered of

high quality by the students.

This semester the Curriculum
Committee will have another sur-
vey during mid-March. This sur-
vey should the faculty approve of
our use of five to ten minutes of
class time, would take place dur-
ing class for a two day period.
Zach student would evaluate each
course he is taking, during this
semester.

The purpose of this survey is
for our Curriculum Committee ‘to
gather the information we feel
necessary to help students select
the best possible courses and hep
our curriculum go even farther in
filling the needs of the students.
If you have any questions, our
committee meets every Tuesday,
at 7:05 p.m. in the student center,
and if you have any suggestion
concerning the curriculum we
would appreciate your meeting
with us anytime this semester.

Threat of rationing looms
over road-tripping students

By JOHN MULLIKEN

Are fuel shortages real? Energy
czar John Simon assures us they
are; Ralph Nader claims the oil
companies are ripping off the con-
sumer and trying to drive the
independents out of business.

Regardless of Nader’s accuracy,
demand for fossil fuels cannot
continue to rise; we've got to find
new energy sources, and, for the
time being, learn to live with less.

Over vacation, the White House
re-aligned some allocations, and
asked the oil companies to cut
gas production by 20%.

The W&L community has felt
the energy crisis, primarily in
relation to our cars, after all some

85% of the student body has a
car, and social life here is highly
dependent on the ability to get
down the road.

The White House is not con-
trolling gas price ceilings and the
average gas price is up nine
cents per gallon over last year at
this time. Despite widespread
predictions to the contrary, Simon
says prices won’t go as high as
70 cents per gallon. Meanwhile
an increasing number of stations
are limiting gas purchases to
three dollars, or ten gallons.

In the background lies a sleep-
ing monster, rationing. As ration-

‘Super Sunday’ - not
so super after all

By BILL AUSTIN
Ring-tum Phi Sports Editor
Publicists heralded January 13
as “Super Sunday,” but the Miami
Dolphins made the gala event just
another exercise in perfection
when they outclassed sluggish
Minnesota in the NFL’s title tilt.

In retrospect, very little can be
said. From the opening kick-off,
Florida’s beach-boy champs held
the upper hand, putting on a
neat, precise 62-vard drive to gain
a lead they never relinquished.
Naturally, the act featured the
usual Csonka-thrusts, sprinkled
with the tasteful diversions of
Griese-bullets and Morris-sprints.

Indeed, the team’s bear of a
fullback rushed 33 times; Griese
unfurled his magical arm on but
seven occasions. The game, dis-
tressingly enough, to those fans
seeking excitement, was quite
similiar to the Dolphins’ earlier
dissection of Oakland. Not even
Tarkenton’s 18 completions could
alter the undeniable course of
things. Sadly, the oft-touted Min-
nesota defense was found lacking
hefore the bleary eyes of a nation.

If anything could be considered

which preceded football’s bid at
oppulence, and surely upstaged it.
ACC basketball at its best? Per-
haps, if the sad play of Tom
3urleson (he managed a 3 for
19 shooting mark) can be for-
gotten or excused in some soph-
ist’s mad scheme (gee...Len
Elmore played great defense ...).
What was uniquely excellent was
the home-court wizzardry of
David Thompson, whose 41 points
keved the Wolfpack’s hard-earned
80-74 victory over the visiting
Terps.

In a sense, Thompson exhibited
the sort of skill that enables one
team to defeat another of finer
overall calibre. It was a feat
which touted Tarkenton could not
match in his quixotic campaign
against football’s fat cats. Indeed,
one wonders if any single star
could upset the flawless Dolphin
organism when cash is on the
line.

Question: if such consistency
constitutes a dynasty, who wants
one? Where are we if sport ap-
proaches the same mundane pre-
dictability that haunts everyday
life? (Yawn. Stretch.) Remember

 

 

“super” on this particular day, it the Colt-Packer play-off game
would have to be the North where Tom Matte was quarter-

Frustration last week present-
ed the 1973-74 Washington and
Lee University basketball bunch
with its largest dose of this per-
vasive, mind-taunting emotion to
date.

Three games were lost by the
grand total of 11 points. A gea-
son’s hopes were further dimmed
as the overall won-lost mark
slipped to 2-7,

A week ago Tuesday night, fol-
lowing the ,omp over Susque-
hanna, the Generals traveled to
nearby Bridgewater, and were
sent home a disgruntled outfit,
losers by 71-63. After the defeat,
Coach Canfield juggled his start-
ing line-up considerably, insert-
ing Greg Croghan, Gary Fitzger-
ald and Paul Maloney to comple-
ment the nucleus of Lichtfuss and
Williams.

The renovated attack started
slowly against Wilmington Col-
lege at Doremus last Thursday.

Fortunately, the invading Wild-
cats matched the W&L offense

for cold shooting.

For example, a Randy Taylor
lay-up tied the score at 12 apiece
9 minutes into the first half.

Two and a half minutes later,
Fitzgerald's 12-footer put the Gen-
erals on top at 14-12.

ployed by both teams. W&L’s
multitudinal substitutions seem-
ed to hamper the team’s efforts to
establish any sort of offensive
continuity, the sharp passing
needed to counter-act a tight 2-1-2
defensive set-up. Yet, the tough,
physical play of the entire squad,
particularly that of Croghan, who
retrieved numerous missed shots
and errant passes, created a
formidable obstacle in its own
zone. Indeed, Wilmington never
succeeded in working the ball in-
side for good shots in any consis-
tent fashion.

Not so for the Generals. With
Norm Kristoff and Skip Lichtfuss
teaming up, W&L closed the
opening half with a rush, out-
scoring its opponent 13-0 in the
period’s final four minutes. The
33-23 bulge at intermission semm-
ed a mere portension of grander
achievements. The momentum
was there...

Somehow, Wilmington guard
Phil Melillo and butterballish sub
Paul McDade failed to get the
message. Consequently, the 10-
point margin which the Generals
maintained mid-way into the final
half was persistently, agonizingly
pared down. The Wildcats ex-
pended no vast amount of artistry
in their comeback.

Melillo occasionally displayed
moments of awkwardness, yet he
hit three shots in the final two
minutes of regulation-time. Me-
Dade... the 6’5” soph appeared to
undergo a_ transfiguration of
character as the contest entered
its final phases. Neither swift nor
showy, he nevertheless collected
five crucial] points in the overtime
period,

Fueled by such unlikely heroes,
Wilmington made its dash to vic-
tory with less than four minutes
remaining. Trailing by 57-50, the
Wildcats earned a tie of 66-all

by Lichtfuss and Guy Kerr failed
to connect, and the Generals en-
tered the five-minute stanza for
the first time this season.

Fabled momentum now sided
with determined Wilmington, Mc-
Dade and Melillo put the Wild-
cats in front by 7, at 73-66, and
the Generals never recovered. A
pair of baskets by Kristoff closed
the gap to 75-74, but McDade’s
free throw upped the margin to
two with but 18 seconds left.
Wé&L’s hopes expired when, a
mere three ticks from defeat,
Kristoff rebounded a missed shot
while on the floor, attempted to
stand and shoot, and was called
for traveling.

Lichtfuss led W&L scorers with
23 points, while Bow Williams
and Kristoff added 16 and 12
points, respectively. McDade head-
ed Wilmington’s offensive totals
with 15 points.

The night was not totally given
to defeat, for the frosh gained a
tight 99-97 win over Virginia
Baptist in the 6 p.m. preliminary.
The victory was the second con-
secutive triumph for the squad—
they defeated Bridgewater 91-62
on Tuesday—evening its record at
2.2

Saturday night’s encounter at
Towson State turned out to be
the varsity’s culminating episode
of futility. Behind the sharp
shooting of Croghan, the team
jumped out to a 13-2 first-half
lead, and played some of its finest
basketball of the season. Several
times the bulge swelled to 13
points, but the prosperity did not
last. At the half, W&L clung to

Sydney

a 42-37 advantage, benefitting
from the prolific scoring of
Croghan and home-coming Licht-
fuss, each of whom collected 12
first-period points.

Alas, second-half woes again
snagged the Generals. Erratic
officiating, surely not an un-
known element in previous con-
tests, characterized the battle.
Several of Towson center Pat Me-
Kinley’s blocks were overlooked
goal-tends.

But this alone can’t explain
away still another General col-
lapse. Fulfilling a role similiar to
McDade’s in the Thursday game,
Greg Hicks came off the bench to
gun for 13 points, 11 of them com-
ing in the final six minutes of
the affair. His conversion of both

Nixon will avoid rationing if he
possibly can.

The rationing program would

Ration tickets can be sold to
