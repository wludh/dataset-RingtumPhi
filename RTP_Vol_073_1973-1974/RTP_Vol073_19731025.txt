W&L protests Nixon firing of Cox

A student poll on impeachment,
a Republican Club resolution call-
ing for an investigation into the
possibility of impeachment, and
a flurry of petitions have high-
lighted anti-Nixon activities on
campus since his firing of Special
Watergate Prosecutor Archibald
Cox, and the resignation of At-
torney General Elliot Richardson
in protest of the firing Saturday
night.

Results were unavailable at
press time on the student poll.
Students were being asked
Whether an investigation into pos-
sible impeachment proceedings
should be initiated and _ also
whether actual impeachment
should be begun. Results of the

poll were to be sent to Congress.

Executive Committee officials
said the voting was running about
8-1 against Nixon. The poll is
being conducted by the EC. It
was not known what effect
Nixon’s decision Tuesday night to
release the tapes would have on
the outcome of the vote, or on
quelling the current rising tide
of sentiment against Nixon.

The Republican Club, by a 7-4
vote of its Executive Committee,
asked for an investigation in addi-
tion to asking the Republican
Party to disassociate itself from
unquestioned support for Nixon.

The resolution said Nixon’s fir-
ing of Cox “smacks of, though
possibly does not entirely indi-

cate, an allempt —to obstruct
justice The Administration
has followed a policy of further
erosion of personal, political, and
economic freedom.”

The EC has been distributing
petitions calling for investigation
into possible impeachment pro-
ceedings in conjunction with its
poH. The petitions will also be
sent to Congress.

The Law School was the first
tangible body within the Univer-
sity (tO set after tie ficing sf
Cox. By Monday, Larry Framme,
president of the Student Bar As-
sociation here, had circulated a
petition calling for an investiga-
tion and had garnished 145. sig-

natures out of the approximately
250 students in the school.

The Executive Committee Mon
day night resolved to write to
Congressional leader Carl Albert.
The letter was signed by six of
the 12 EC members, The EC
debated for nearly 45 minutes on
the wording of the letter and the
question of whether to use offic-
ial EC stationary.

Rumors of a possible student
strike were floating around cam.
pus ever since the Saturday
night firing of Cox. As of press
time, no definitive action had
been taken to formally strike,
Nixon’s decision to release the
tapes was a possible factor in
quelling the possibility of a strike,

New constitution approved,
4 amendments defeated

By ROBERT PUGH

The proposed student body
constitution was approved by the
Washington and Lee student body
last week, 901-261. The new consti-
tution serves as a revision of the
old one, first incorporated in the
1940's.

The new constitution abolishes
the Dance Board and _ institutes
the Student Activities Board.

Another major provision of the
new constitution calls for a two-

thirds majority of all students
yoting to approve an amendment
to the constitution. Until now,

amendments needed majority ap-
proval of the entire student body
to be passed,

All four “controversial” amend-
ments to the proposed constitu-
tion were defeated. The totals

were: to allow exchange students
voting rights—690-417; to allow an
additional freshman representa-
tive on the Executive Committee
—720-380; to allow an additional
law school representative on the
EC—497-616; and to require a
minimum of three EC members
to call an executive session—687-
386. All amendments needed 802
votes—a majority of the student
body as required under the old
constitution—to pass.

Executive Committee members
indicated most of the amendment
proposals would be brought up
again next Spring under the new
constitution for a vote of the stu-
dents, this time requiring only a
two-thirds approval of those stu-
dents voting providing half of

louTLooK and REVIEW

Impeachment and Richard Nixon

Consider the following:
—Friday, as part of homecoming, a panel discussion was held in
Lee Chapel on the constitutional implications of impeachment.

—Last Saturday night in the television lounges of the student
center, most Washington and Lee students were stunned when CBS
announced that Special Watergate Proecutor Archibald Cox had been
fired. The stunned silence which took the room was shattered by a
near standing ovation upon the further revelation that Elliott Richard-
son had resigned from his post of Attorney General in protest of Cox’s
firing.

—The law school student body has sent a petition with 143
names on it to Speaker of the House Car] Albert, calling for an
investigation into possible impeachment proceedings.

—A poll was conducted Tuesday and Wednesday asking student
opinion on both the question of investigation into possible impeach-
ment proceedings and the question of impeachment itself.

—The Washington and Lee Republican Club, touted as the top
organization of tis kind in the country, has passed a resolution in
its Executive Committee, 7-4, calling for the disassociation of Richard
Milhous Nixon from the Republican Party.

—Petitions, telegrams, and other actions of written protest have
been circulating around this campus since Saturday night’s action by
Nixon.

—Movements have been started looking into the possibility of a
student strike probably next week to protest the firing of Cox and
support either investigation into or initiation of impeachment proceed-
ings against Nixon.

At the time of this writing, action has been so fast and furious
since Cox’s firing Saturday that the majority of the Washingon and
Lee community—as well as the majority of the nation—has been
whipped into a verbal frenzy as to what should be done to de-power
the most powerful person on earth,

The government is in a mess. That may be the grossest under-
statement ever made, but there is simply no other way to describe it.

Why is this so? Because the man whose job it is to keep the
government running smoothly can no longer perform the one task
that was “mandated” to him in 1972. He can no longer govern.

The question is no longer one of getting Mr. Nixon out of the
White House because of what he can do, though, granted, what he
has done has put this country into a slimy pit of chaos and uncer-
tainty. Rather, the question is one of forcing Richard Milhous Nixon
out of the White House because of what he can’t do. And the one
thing he can no longer do is govern effectively.

Look at the President’s situation now. His popularity is at its
lowest point since he was elected, according to reliable polls. He has
certainly lost the full trust of many Senators and Congressmen. His
stature abroad has surely diminished, if not plummeted.

What will be done in the following months (or possibly days)
is certainly difficult to foresee. Impeachment is still a harsh word in
the House of Representatives. And even if an investigation into
possible impeachment proceedings is instigated, there is still a strong
bloc of Congressmen and Senators which could stop the initiation of
impeachment proceedings in the House or vote to clear the President
in the Senate.

Of course, there remains the problem of the successor to the
President, should Nixon leave office. There is no Vice-President;
Gerald Ford is nominated, but circumstances surrounding the entire
administration have blocked his immediate approval. Car] Albert, as
Speaker of the House, currently stands next in line for the presidency.
A changing of the White House guard from Republican to Democrat
is certainly a consideration here.

The proposal of Morris K. Udall of Arizona is another considera-
tion to be brought up for discussion by Congress, Udall proposes that
Gerald Ford be approved as Vice-President more or less in exchange
for Nixon’s resignation. However, it smacks of a compromise, and
that, after all, was what started this latest mess.

Resignation? Possibly the best course of action, but you might
have a little trouble convincing our President of the merits of that
possibility. The move would be certain to save everyone a lot of
problems, while posing a few more, but it is highly unlikely.

No matter how it is done, however, Richard Milhous Nixon must
be removed from office. It may be he who suffers the most in the
end, but it is the American people who suffer now. Until Nixon leaves,
the government, or at least the Execuitve Branch, of the United
States, will remain inoperative.

Spiro Agnew... Why is this man smiling?

Ask Traveler

Q.—How does one cope with A hour?

A—By first shrugging off the idea that you, as a professional student,
have the responsibility for coping with anything that early in
the day. Of course, to ignore A hour altogether is the obvious
solution. But being obvious only works if you’re Lance Rentzel
or Milton Berle. In this soft world of the ivy halls, one must be
cunning to make it pay.

Your objective in A hour should be to get out of it as soon
as possible—even before roll is called. Spilling scalding hot Co-op
coffee (cleverly cooled the night before on a window sill) on
your pants is the best bet for making effective and rapid exit
from class; remember to keep shouting ‘infirmary’ or ‘student
insurance plan’ all the way to the door for that realistic touch.

Another good ruse involves having a friend deliver a fake
message to you in the middle of class that reports your hometown
to have just caved in and urgently requests your presence there
before the Luray Caverns claim your dinning room place setting
for their new concession stand. A third ploy that can be used
effectively is pasting a B-parking decal on your forehead and
having the university proctor tow you out of class for illegal
loitering. It’s the imaginative touch that makes those get-away-
acts convincing. Those easy days of having an ecstatic religious
experience under your desk are, alas, gone forever,

If your creative talents refuse to function that early in the
morning and you are forced to sweat it out, don’t despair, There
are Ways to make things tolerable. First of all, remember your

Concert Concerns

Dear Sir,

The problems of concerts at
W&L are certainly no _ longer
news. Laying out the problems
involved, though, will hopefully
bring to light for all concerned
the nature of those problems and
some possible solutions, which I
hope this letter will help to do.

In my four years as a student
at W&L, (yes, I did my time), I
saw many changes in the concert
situation at this school. Most of
the changes were good, but by
no means all of them. Now, as
a person who works and lives in
Lexington and hangs out a good
bit around W&L, I hope the “fish
out of water’ perspective I am
moving towards can help some of
vou who are still tied (up?) into
the school scene on a full-time
basis to see where its shortcom-
ings lie.

In the past, the problem was
usually that of getting good-qual-
itv musical groups to come here
at all because of lack of money.
With the institution of the Stu-
dent Activities Board this year
and the help of the EC this prob-
lem has been partially overcome.
We can now afford good groups
to a limited extent. If Earl Sruggs
isn’t first class, I don’t know
what is.

So here is/was the catch: we
could only afford Scruggs for a
weeknight concert. Cost differ-
ences between during-the-week
and weekend bokings are more
than negligible, and in some cases
are as high as 150 percent. Even
though funding for concerts is
substantially higher this year
than in the past, it is still limit-
ed, and a weeknight booking
seemed prudent to better insure
more concerts later in the year.

By now you may be asking
exactly what the problem is. In
a word, it is schoolwork. I do
not mean to construct any con-
cept of blame, guilt, or other
moralistic trapping, or to put it
upon any one group of people
such as the faculty for this situa-
tion. It was a combination of
circumstances which to my
knowledge had never before come
to pass at W&L: mid-terms,
homecoming, and a concert all
happening simultaneously.

My greatest hope in composing
this letter is that a similar situa-
tion can be avoided in the future.
My suggestion is that the faculty
could help us on the S.A.B. and
the entire student body by mov-
ing big work load deadlines
(such as tests and_ papers)

forward or back a day or two
if/when another weeknight con-
cert happens.

What we are trying to give the
faculty, and students, in return
will take a bit longer to appreci-
ate, for it is a change in student
attitude about school in general.
The help the S.A.B. needs from
the faculty in the manner I de-
scribed above is much more im-
medite, we hope only for this
school year.

If the S.A.B. can make first-rate
quality concerts a_ financially
feasible operation at W&L this
year, we can do it every year. We
would like to do that, but we
have not yet succeeded. The losses
from the Scruggs concert have
vet to be fully perceived, but
the year is still young.

My idea is that if the student
body is presented with a diverse
assortment of good concerts and
other activities during any given
school year, then the students will
be more responsive to their aca-
demic courses. The extracurricu-
lar events provided for the stu-
dents will serve to augment con-
ventional methods of expanding
consciousness through going to
classes. Learning is not all from
books. High quality occasional
alternatives to “grinding” will
make students more responsive
to the knowledge they encounter
in school.

Many people I spoke with last
week were unable to attend the
concert because of school work.
With concerts happening here at
the rate of four or five a year,
this is a lamentable situation.

It is also easily avoidable, if we
all give a little. There is much
for everyone to gain.

As the old saying goes, all work
and no play makes Jack a dull
boy. For sure, all play and no
work would do the same. I feel
there is a balance to be found.

We should not be afraid to
search for it. Profs, could we
have a little help?

This is a game where we can
all be winners.

Class of 1973

Editor’s Note: The Student Acti-
vities Board will have to be
looking more to the promoter
it contracted to bring in name
concerts after losing $3500 on
the Scruggs deal. But then, if
the S.A.B. lost that much, the
promoter might be wary about
bringing in name concerts while
trying to garnish a profit on
the whole deal.

 

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

 

By ROME SCOTT

Of all the possible “Once upon
a time” stories, the situation in
the ivory tower called “the Hill”
fits most precisely.

The make-believe “I want”
passes through many mouths but
little action direct or indirect is
taken by the majority.

For years the Dance Board was
a scapegoat for the student body’s
complaints about the quality or
lack of concerts on the hill and,
even after a significant change
in the acting body’s format and
the creation of the Student Activi-
ties Board, the result is the same.

And no matter how many times
the way concerts are handled
is changed the result will be the
same unless the student body is
willing to support the effort of
the group in charge.

The lack of top name groups at
Washington and Lee is directly
reflective of the student body’s
apathetic, or simply pathetic, at-
titude towards the University as
a whole.

The feeling that everything
should be presented to the stu-
dent body on the proverbial plat-
ter has got to change or not only
will that platter be empty but the
danger of losing the platter al-

together will become more than
the currently imminent.

Recent efforts to bring any kind
of musical entertainment to the
campus are to be lauded simply
because they exist.

Those who shout “if we had
better concerts we’d go” need pull
the situation together. Not only
will there be lower quality con-
certs in the future if the student
body doesn’t back up the Enter-
tainment Committee of the Stu-
dent Activities Board, but there is
a good possibility that there will
be none at all—of any quality.

Homecoming Weekend was not
as successful as it could’ve been
The Scruggs Revue concert was
poorly attended for several rea-
sons, the most vocalized of which
was that it was held on a week-
night during mid-terms.

Friday night’s Impression’s
dance seemed to be better-attend-
ed but even then the improvemnt
was not enough.

The upcoming Tower of Power
concert should be a good one. At
least, it will give the student body
a chance for a good time—at
most, it will give the student body
a chance to prove it is interested
in having concerts,

COME WINTER by Evan Hunter
(Doubleday, $5.95).

Peter, David and Sandy had
been friends forever, or so it
seemed. They were inseparable
and Peter reveled in it. His psy-
chiatrist abhorred it. Dr. Kra-
kouer advised—no, begged—him
not to go to Semanee Peak with
David and Sandy, but off he went.

A skiing holiday, that is all the
outing was meant to be, and
yet, it turned out to be much
more.

A shattered leg, a question of
why and a girl’s untimely death
at the bottom of a cliff, all go to
create an adventure that is a
lesson in group psychology. Evan
Hunter’s book is this plus.

Couched as easily among new-
born, vibrant metaphor as_ the
ski lodge at Semanee is among
rolling, snow-covered hills, the
story unfolds so naturally it lulls
the reader hypnotically, unsus-
pectingly along until he is so in-

Halloween festival of films on Wednesday

The Student Activities Board
Film Committee brings “Johnny
Got His Gun” to Washington and
Lee this weekend and brings a
Halloween festival of five films
to the Cockpit next Wednesday.

“Johnny Got His Gun” will be
presented Saturday and Sunday
at 7 and 9 p.m. Admission is $1.

The story centers around a World
War I soldier who survives a
bomb blast with little more than
his mind and trunk left intact.

The Halloween film festival in
the Cockpit will feature reduced
prices on beer from 9 to 11 p.m.
The movies, for which there is

no admission charge, will be
shown from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m,

Movies scheduled for the festi-
val include: “Creature from the
Black Lagoon,” “Frankenstein
Meets the Wolfman,” “The Wolf-
man,” “Dracula,” and “The Phan-
tom of the Opera.”

ally no chance of escaping un-
scathered.

The reader’ suffers  Peter’s
doubts as he describes the action
and tries to place value judge-
ments on his behavior in terms
of Dr. Krakauer’s belief that the
relationship between the trio
gives them a sense of omipotence
tantamount to that of Ruskolni-
koff’s in Dostoevski’s “Crime and
Punishment.”

Peter ultimately dismisses his
doubts through his determination
to make the most of the snow.
Then it happens.

Mary Margaret Buono appears
and antagonizes the three without
realizing how dangerous her
action is.

Skiing the north face of Sema-
nee with them, she stops, reaches
out to pick up her glove, and is
lost to eternity.

A victim of the deadly trio?
Come winter, anything is possible.
For any reason.

Petters To The Sditor...

On faculty references

Dear Sir:

Last vear I found myself writ-
ing more than 200 letters of
recommendation for Washington
and Lee seniors wanting to go
to Law School or into graduate
studies. From the requests I have
already received, it seems a pretty
fair guess that this will be
another busy vear. That is as it
should be, for that goes with the
job. Moreover, I enjoy lending a
hand where I can. Still, some
ground rules apply.

In fairness to myself and to
others, I will write only three
Jetters for each applicant. When
requesting such letters, please
enclose such data as class stand-
ing, grade point average, Campus
activities and other material
which can help build a case. Also
send law board scores.

Be realistic. Unless you have
better than a 3.0 average, do not
apply to Yale, Harvard, Univer-
sity of Virginia, Michigan. If you
have exceptionally high law
boards, then, perhaps, you can
be an exception to this rule, but
the board scores must be very
high, indeed. Have some back up
school in mind. There are 90

5
a

 

eae

accredited law schools in the
United States. To make Law Re-
view in Kansas is better than
being anchor man at Stanford.
There is also something to be
said for going to the law school
of your home state, particularly
if vou have politics in mind (and
many of you do!). In the best
law schools there is no such
things as pull or influence, but in
some of the others it still works
(still in my mind is the student
for whom I wrote 11 letters and
who finally landed on his feet as
a result of a telephone call). Be
realistic about this, too.

Airmail letters from Austria
cost about 40 cents. I cannot use
American stamps. You cannot,
without a good deal of trouble,
send money. Take it easy on a
professor who is on half salary in
a country with high rate of in-
flation and a weak dollar. If you
want to be kind, send unattached
stamps which I can use next year.

Now, having set forth these
three points, let me throw in some
personal advice, not in any way
guaranteed to be correct, but at
least stemming from long held
beliefs. I am the fourth straight
generation of University profes-
sors, and while that may produce

genetic damage, it does have the
advantage of learning from the
mistakes of others. For instance,
do you really want to go to law
school? The American Bar As-
sociation estimated last year that
by 1976 there would be 17% too
many lawyers and the enactment
of no-fault insurance laws may
just bring this about. As for
graduate studies, look over the
recent Carnegie Report on
Higher Education and see what
the half life of an English teacher
is or will be. I am not saying
don’t go. If teaching or practic-
ing law is what you know you
want to do, then by all means
go to it. We'll rally around the
flag and push and shove as much
as we can. But if you just aren’t
sure what you want to do (ex-
cept you want to take your hands
out of daddy’s pockets), then why
not just get a job, and while you
work, think things over. Better a
correct decision a year late, than
an early start in the wrong di-
rection.

All good luck,

Milton Colvin,

Another Lewis Hall?

Librar

Planning for the new  under-
graduate library to be located di-
rectly behind Washington Hall
is now in the last stages of de-
velopment. A general design and
lay-out by Marcellus Wright and
Partners of Richmond have been
accepted by the Board of Trus-
tees. The architects are now
drawing up the final set of plans
which will be offered for bids.

The cost of the project will be
$5,250,000. This figure includes the
cost of construction and _ the
architects’ fee. Additional costs
for the building will come to sev-
eral million. To build on the pres-
sent site will require the reloca-
tion of the utilities nexus ($650,-
000) and extensive site develop-
ment (about $750,000). Another
$600,000-$700,000 must be spent to
equip the new facility.

The total costs for the library
will be approximately the same
as that of Lewis Hall. Although
the proposed undergraduate _li-
brary will be a simpler building
than the law school, the site on
which it will be built is going to
require more preparation.

Plans for the construction are
being pushed ahead as rapidly as
possible, while inflation makes
every delay expensive. The money
to build the new facility has not
yet been raised. Hopefully enough
of the sum needed will be
available by next summer so that
the architects’ plans can be offer-
ed for bids.

The working drawings for the
builders should be completed by
the middle of next summer. Bids
will be accepted in the late sum-
mer and a firm will be awarded
the contract before the beginning
of the Fall Term. The total build-
ing time should be two years.

The first set of plans was pre-
sented to the Board of Trustees
for approval in June, 1972. The
trustees sent the architects back
to the drawing board, finding
their proposals unacceptable.
‘hese plans contained a three
story building which was _ rec-
tangular in shape.

The trustees objected to the
bulk of the building and its pro-
vision for space which could not
be filled immediately. The original
facility would have provided a
good deal of space to be grown
into in the future.

The architects returned with a
revised set of plans in June, 1973.
Their plans were accepted at this
time for a smaller building which,
supposedly, would fit in better
with its neighbors in the Wash-
ington group.

The Richmond firm was given
a list of facilities which should
be included in the new building.
With these requirement in mind
Marcellus Wright, Cox and Cilim-
berg were able to draw lay-outs
for the interior. Among the re-
quirements handed to the archi-
tects were:

—space 500,000

for volumes

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

plans near completion

 

This model of the proposed new library is currently on display in McCormick Library

(the present library houses half
that number).

—s00 reader stations of which
at least 560 will be carrels. Study
rooms for two to four students
are also to be provided.

—2 or 3 seminar rooms with
room for about fifteen people.
These will not be used for regu-
larly scheduled classes.

—an auditorium to hold 100.
This room is intended to be a
cultural center for the Univer-
sity. It will be used for special
speakers, films, and any other
type of presentation for a rela-
tively small group.

—a Rare Book Room to house
the school’s special collections.

—study rooms for smokers.

The present design calls for a
building of five stories to be built
on the site of the Washington
Annexes. Only one of these floors
will be readily visible from the
front. The other levels will ex-
tend downward into the ravine.

The new library will be built
on the modular principle. A 27’
module will be employed because
it can contain library equipment,
aisles and stack ranges with com-
parative ease.

The design for the exterior of
the building was determined after
the requirements for the interior
had been incorporated in a set
of plans. The Richmond architects
made an attempt to fashion a
facility which would blend in
well with the Washington group.
One way in which this was to
be accomplished was the use of
similar materials, colors and lines.

It is true that the building will
be of brick with areas of white.
However, it has been said that
the new library may have more
in common with a multi-story
parking lot than with Washing-
ton Hall.

The Richmond firm whose
ideas will take form in three new
buildings on campus seems to be

stuck in something of a rut. The
library and Lewis Hall are very
much alike in appearance. Both
are brick and concrete with many
square projections.

In the library these projections
will take the form of brick bays
extending at fairly regular in-
tervals around much of the build-
ing. A difference can be seen in
the use of concrete in the two
structures: Lewis Hall will show
more of it.

Both facilities will have some
kind of walkway or bridge lead-
ing to the main entrance. On the
library this modern form of draw-
bridge will connect with the new
brick mall which is to run from
the science buildings to the old
library.

All things considered the plans
for the new undergraduate library
reveal a building which is built
for comfort and is quite func-
tional. The interior may satisfy
the need for more library space
very well. However, from the
look of things to come the ex-

terior does not fulfill its function
of fitting in with the campus.

It would seem that the use of
the same materials and colors
will not be enough to unify the
new and old elements of the
campus placed so close together.
The trustees improved upon the
architects’ design once. One can
only wish that the Board had
pushed them one step further
and thus avoided the possibility
of a modified Lewis Hall in back
of a National Historic Landmark.

Booters defeat

VMI, Roanoke

By MIKE McCOLLOCH

The Washington and Lee vars-
ity soccer team defeated two more
teams last week on their home
field, crushing Roanoke 5-0, and
V.M.I. 7-1.

The Tuesday match against
Roanoke demonstrated the Gen-
rising improvement’ in

nwork. Playing in an unusu-
ally strong wind, the team dis-
piaved the best passing in a game
so far this season. Twenty min-
utes into the game, co-captain
Bill Spofford scored the first goal
unassisted. Two more goals, both
unassisted, were scored in the
first half by Jim Fox, the team’s
leading scorer. In the second half
John Embree scored a goal from
an assist by John Galyon, and
Galyon then made the final score
from an assist by Harry Jembe.
The Generals made a total of
19 shots at the goal, while Roa-
noke took 16. This was the fourth
shutout of the season for W&L.

Saturday, an exceptional per-
formance by the front line helped
spur the team on to the 7-1 vic-

Football Geiterals fall again;
Western Maryland romps, 35-17

By BILL FLESHER
Western Maryland’s Green Ter-
rors handed Washington and Lee

its third consecutive loss last
Saturday, running all over the
Generals en route to a 35-17

victory.

Please don’t interpret the term
“running all over” to infer that
the game was a rout. It wasn’t
at all.

It’s just that Western Maryland
ran. And ran. And ran.

The Green Terrors’ ground
game was paced by quarterback
Mike Bricker, who scored three
touchdowns, and by halfback
Kendrick Weaver, who came off
the bench to pick up 107 yards

tory over V.M.I. Jim Fox scored
three goals, two of them unassist-

John Embree, John Galyon, Chuck
Alexander, and freshman John
Munkenbeck. Assists were award-
ed to Munkenbeck, Bobby Craw-
ford, and co-captain Rolf Piranian.

game, taking 23 shots at the goal

Overlooked in the defeat were

outstanding performances by
sophomore quarterback Jack
3erry and freshman tight end
Tony Perry.

Berry, who took over for the
injured Lewis Powell, went 23
for 42, good for 244 yards and
two touchdowns.

Perry had another outstanding
game, hauling in eight aerials

(seven in the first half) for 86
vards, including a five-yard touch-
down grab.

Berry’s other scoring toss was
a seven-yarder late in the game
to freshman Jay Monahan.

W&L was in the game the
entire first half. They fell be-
hind early after punter Doug

Chase couldn’t handle a snap, as
Western Maryland went 39 yards
in six plays, with Bricker going
the final five. Joe Baines’ con-
version made it 7-0.

Quote of the week

The Ring-tum Phi, in its con-
stant search for words of wisdom
from persons in the know to the
Washington and Lee community,
has landed upon a veritable gold
mine of such wisdom. The gold
mine (who shall remain anonym-
ous) to which we refer was un-
covered deep in the murky cata-
combs of Doremus Gym. Our
initial quote of the week.

“How do you expect me to be
in two places at the same time
without a car?”

  

There’s a place tor you on
Piedmont. For a weekend of
fun, a game out of town, a
quick trip home, whatever—
there’s a Piedmont jet or
propjet flight to fit your
plans. With personal,
thoughtful service always.

when, after

28-9 later in the quarter
Mark Gole picked off
pass, Bricker went 31
yards for his third score. The
conversion made it 28-9 at the
end of three.

The Green Terrors got their
final points after a pair of W&L
errors. First, Mark Dowd inter-
cepted a Berry pass and return-
ed it 67 yards to the W&L 25.
The Generals held there, forcing
WM to try for a field goal.

Jarnes’ attempt fell short and
into the hands of W&L defensive
back Louis McFadden.

And out of them.

Western Maryland recovered
the fumble, two players later
Mark Yurik scored from the one,
and the point after made it 35-9.

W&L added a touchdown on
the Berry-to-Monahan scoring
toss, an da two-pointer, but such

efforts were too late in coming.
