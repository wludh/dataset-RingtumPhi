Faculty defeats adding students
to administrative committees

The faculty Monday voted down
a proposal which would have in-
creased student representation on
the Committee on Courses and
Degrees and the Executive Com-
mittee of the Faculty.

Two students would have been
appointed to each committee had
the proposal been approved.

Currently, one student serves
on each of the committees — the
chairman of the Student Curri-
culum Committee serves on the
Courses and Degrees Committee,
and a member of the student EC
serves on the faculty EC.

The Faculty EC, in making the
recommendation, set a limit of

two students on each committee
because “the faculty should retain
a clear voting majority” in mat-
ters handled by the two commit-
tees. The move to add another
student to each committee was an
attempt, said the Faculty EC, “to
maintain a clear and open chan-
nel of communication between
the student body and these two
committees.”

The motion was part of a Fac-
ulty EC move to promote better
communication between the stu-
dents and faculty. The EC is also
trying to encourage student in-
put at departmental levels.

Despite the defeat of the pro-

Alumni reunions scheduled

More than 250 alumni of Wash-
ington and Lee University and
their families will return to the
campus this weekend for class
reunions,

The reunions will be highlight-
ed by the 26th annual John Ran-
dolph Tucker lecture in law, the
annual meeting of the W&L
Alumni Association, class ban-
quets and other social activities,
and the Wé&L lacrosse game
against Cortland State.

William H. Hiller of Chicago,
outgoing president of the alumni
association, will preside at the
annual meeting. A special feature
will be presentation of the first
annual Distinguished Alumnus
Awards, conferred upon nomina-
tion by W&L alumni themselves.
Elections for new officers wil!
also take place at the meeting.

George D. Gibson, a partner in
the Richmond law firm of Hun-
ton, Williams, Gay & Gibson, wi'l
deliver the Tucker Lecture at

noon Saturday in Lee Chapel.
Members of the public are in-
vited to attend the lecture as
guests of W&L’s School of Law.

Another high point of the week-
end will be Washington and Lee’s
final lacrosse game of the regular
season, in which the second-rank-
ed Generals take on Cortland
State in a match that will be of
special interest because Cortland
was coached until two years ago
by W&L’s Coach of the Year, Jack
Emmer. The Generals will be
fighting to hold onto their sec-
ond position in anticipation of na-
tional playoffs, which will be
begin the next weekend.

Class banquets and a reunion
party will close out the weekend's
formal activities.

Returning for their reunions
will be members of the classes of
1924 (for their 50th), 1934, 1949,
1959 and 1964—together with
alumni who graduated more than
half a century ago, the “Old
Guard.”

posal, however, some action
was taken in the faculty meet-
ing Monday in an effort to open
channels of communications be-
tween students and faculty.

A motion was approved which
would allow the presiding officer
at a faculty meeting to release
the results of the deliberations of
that meeting, together with what-
ever comments and_interpreta-
tions the presiding officer may
wish to add.

Such releases would be distrib-
uted to the Ring-tum Phi, WLUR,
the president of the student body,
and the university’s public in-
formation director within 24
hours of the faculty meeting.

Faculty meetings are closed to
students.

Mitch Seleznick, Duane Fluharty,
and John Ratzel. There will be
three seniors reps., two junior
reps., and two sophomore reps.
on the UC.

Elections for president of the
Independent Union will not be
held at the same date as are the
UC elections. Instead, there will
be an attempt to place this elec.
tion during the Fall term.

A meeting is to be held in Lee
Chapel, May 14 at 8 pm. to
discuss the Honor Code. Ben
Bailey and Doug Schwatz are to
preside over the meeting. Stu-
dents and faculty are invited to
come and air their views.

A student referendum is to be
held May 13. The proposals to be
decided or voted upon are: (1)
one more EC representative from
the Freshman class; (2) student
plebiscite to decide on tax poli-
cies; (3) amendment to the Con-
stitution to be proposed by hav:
ing a petition with 200 signatures
An amendment would have to be
passed by two third of half or
over, of those who vote; (4) all
students who pay student activity
tax will be considered members
of the student body.

The latter amendment applies
to the exchange students, since
they will have to pay the same
amount of tax as do W&L stu-
dents. This would enable them
to be entitled to the same privi-
leges W&L students possess.

For the vear of ’75-’76, students
will pay $5 in order to finance
the Steering Committee for the
Mock Convention.

Standing committee applications due

The deadline for applications
to standing committees of the
Executive Committee has been
extended to Friday at 6 p.m.
Applications are to be turned into
the EC box in the University
Center.

Applications will be accepted
for Student Activities Board chair-
man and the subcommittees of
the SAB, including entertainment-
recreation, student center, culture,
film, secretary and treasurer.

Applications will also be ac-
cepted for committees on mock
convention, curriculum, recruit-
ing, and cold check, and for the
voting regulations board.

Interviews will be held May
13-15.

All applicants are to include
their phone numbers on the appli-
cations, Applicants for SAB chair-
man must present a complete pro-
gram for 1974-75.

Student arrested second time for streaking

A Washington and Lee student
has been arrested for streaking

. again.

John Buckley Keefe, 20, a
sophomore from Milford, Conn.,
was arrested by Lexington police
Saturday morning at 2 a.m. and
charged with indecent exposure.

Keefe will appear in Lexington
General District Court at a later
date.

Keefe pleaded no contest to a
charge of indecent exposure last
month for streaking in Lexington
That streak was made in March.

Defending the need for Ariel

Frankly, we are stymied.

Rumblings are that the Executive Committee of the student
body wants to cut off funds for Ariel, the student literary
magazine. The EC calls the publication a waste of student
funds; it says the students’ moneys could be better spent.

That the Ariel is limited in its appeal is a point we cannot
contest. But then, we are beginning to think the EC is also
quite limited in its appeal to the student body. Whatever the
case, however, the Ariel is simply an outlet for student cre-
ativity.

The problem the EC should be considering is not that
funds for the Ariel should be cut off because the magazine
appeals to the interests of a select few at W&L; rather, the
Ariel’s ability to serve the entire student body is limited be-
cause of lack of funds. The EC is simply looking at the situa-
tion the wrong way.

Higher production costs forced the Ariel this year to forego
an issue devoted to photography. Such an issue printed last
year was well-received by the W&L community. But because
the Ariel could not get more funds this year, such an issue of
wide student appeal had to be omitted from the plans of the
magazine. Ariel’s appeal to the students seems to vary pro-
portionately to the financial ability of that publication to even
attempt projects more far-reaching than just prose and poetry
publications.

Ariel’s appeal is limited simply because it doesn’t have the
funds to widen its appeal to students.

And the EC wants to solve the problem by abolishing Ariel.

Ariel’s budget this year—$1600.

The EC thinks $1600 is too much to spend on creativity,
on the development of a fine arts outlet even, at W&L.

Yet, this same EC wants the Board of Trustees to shell
out #4-, $5-, or even $6-million to build a fine arts center for
those students unable to find any kind of outlet for their
creativity within the cramped confines of W&L’s current fine
arts facilities.

Again, we are stymied.

How can the Board of Trustees even begin to look at an
EC proposal for a multi-million dollar fine arts center with any
seriousness if the EC wants to cut what little it now spends—
$1600—on an outlet for creativity at this university now? With
more money, Ariel is the only campus organization that could
conceivably bring together under one organization a multitude
of outlets for student work—not just prose and poetry, but
plays, films, photography, even art shows as well.

If Ariel were abolished by the EC, because $1600 was too
much to spend on fine arts, we think the Board of Trustees
would just laugh in the EC’s collective face if it should have
the gall to ask for millions of dollars for a fine arts center.

And well the Board should.

—P.J.L.

Austerity in the EC budget

Speaking of austerity in the EC budget:

If the EC really wants to cut down expenses, why not get
rid of that fancy dinner it holds in honor of itself every year.
That would save a few precious dollars.

And cancel that order for letter openers for each member
of the EC this year. Another few bucks saved.

Perhaps there is jusification for these expenses. The point
is, however, that we find it a hell of a lot easier to justify the
Ariel’s costs than the costs of these little presents the persons

in the government are presenting themselves this year. Ariel
may only serve a limited number of students, but it still serves
a lot more students than does a banquet given by the EC in
honor of itself.

What local high school
students think of W&L

Sir:

In the winter of 1973-74, under
the supervision of our teachers
Bob Carrere and David Turk, we,
two seniors at Lexington High
School, conducted a survey of
area high school students. The
survey measured attitudes of Lex-
ington High School and Parry
McCluer High School students
towards students of Washington
and Lee and Virginia Military
Institute as compared with their
attitudes of the nation as a whole.
Three percent of the schools’ stu-
dent bodies were surveyed with
a questionnaire administered dur-
ing an interview.

The resulting stereotypes form-
ulated from the data were quite
the opposite of our anticipations.
On the whole LHS students saw
Wé&L students to be about equal
to the nation as a whole in the
categories of “intelligence,”
“moral,” “wealthy,” “conserva-
tive,” and “responsible.” They al-
so perceived VMI student equal

 

to the nation on all but two; VMI
students were characterized as
more intelligent and responsible
than the nation as a whole.

PMHS regarded W&L students
to be equal to the nation as a
whole on all categories but one.
They perceived W&L_ students
less conservative than the nation
as a Whole. VMI students were
seen as more conservative and
more responsible and about equal
in all the other categories.

We find these results interest-
ing and think your student body
might be interested in them. We
recognize the strong possibility
that these student opinions, espec-
ially those of 8th-10th graders,
are greatly influenced by par-
ental biases and opinions. Rather
boldly, we’re suggesting that the
survey reflects in some measure
“town-gown” relationships _ be-
tween W&L and VMI students
and the citizens of the surround-
ing area.

Sincerely,
Teresa Filson and
Kathy Mohler

Automatic rule committee to meet

The Committee on the Auto-
matic Rule will meet at 10:30 a.m.
on Tuesday, June 4, 1974. At that
time the Committee will consider
the following groups of students,
who have fallen under the Auto-
matic Rule, for possible immedi-
ate reinstatement:

J. those students who failed to
meet the condition of Aca-
demic Probation required of
them at the end of the cur-
rent Spring Term.

2. those students completing a
full academic year who fail-
ed to meet the cumulative
average of their class.

The Committee will consider
for immediate reinstatement all
students who fall under the Auto
matic Rule, If any student wishes
to inform the Committee of ex-
tenuating circumstances present
in his case, he may write a letter
to the Committee and deliver it
to the Office of the Dean of the

College before June 4. Immedi-
ade reinstatement is the except-
ion rather than the rule. A stu-
dent who falls under the Auto-
matic Rule severs his connection
with the University; if the Com-
mittee does not grant him im-
mediate reinstatement, he may
apply for reinstatement after a
minimum of one year.

As soon as possible after the
Committee’s meeting, each stu-
dent falling under the Automatic
Rule will receive a letter explain-
ing his status; his parents will
receive a copy of that letter.

Any student who is not subject
to the Automatic Rule in June
and who fails to achieve the
cumulative average required at
the end of a full year for his class
(see page 76 in Catalogue) will be
on Academic Probation for the
Fal] Term, and he and his parents
wil] receive notification.

Mr. Natural comes to L

By W. PATRICK HINELY
Allen Ginsberg
May 1, Lee Chapel

The Glasgow Endowment Com-
mittee should be highly commenda-
ed for bringing Allen Ginsberg
to the W&L campus. He is their
first guest in recent years whose
comprehending audience was not
limited to those who are initi-
ates of the esoteric order of
“literati,” a group of usually in-
telligent people who are unfor-
tunately overimpressed with their
own vocabulary and writings.

A self-proclaimed poet of the
people, Ginsberg was very down-
to-earth in his approach. In fact,
he was so down-to-earth that his
somewhat free use of expletives,
four-letter wards, et cetera, was
alarming to some members of the
audience, But that’s all relative;
after all, I talked to several
people who were there who said
they were more alarmed by some
of the people in the audience than
by the language Ginsberg was
using.

Ginsberg’s greatest influences
have come from some Eastern
traditions which we Westerners
usually label as religion. Chief
among these are Hinduism and
3uddhism. Ginsberg draws his
poetic inspirations, indeed most
of his motivation for living, from
an old Eastern practice, the art
of meditation.

There are as many types of
meditation as there are medita-
tors, but most have in common
the characteristic of being con-
stead of doing. Thought, or think-
cerned with letting a human
mind be occupied by being in-
ing, is believed by some authori-
ties to be original sin of Adam.
Meditation is a process through
which thinking can be channeled
into completely positive, or good,

$5 of $30

for student

The Executive Committee Mon-
day recommended to next year’s
EC that $5 per student be de-
ducted from the student tax and
set aside each year as a donation
fund,

Students then could donate
their $5 to some facet of student
life which they feel needs im-
provement. The money, for ex-
ample, could be donated by a
group of students to buy a desk
caculator for school use. Money
could also be donated to argani-
zation on campus,

All proposed projects would
have to be approved by the fac-
ulty or administration. The EC
would have final say in approving
the project.

A student could not split up his
$5 gift.

Money not used in the course
of the year would go to the EC
Reserve Fund.

The $5 donation fund was pro-

directions. Thinking is an inevit-
able process within the mature
human mind; meditation is an at-
tempt at its beneficial control.

Ginsberg’s personal method is
to sit in a traditional Eastern
posture, with spine erect, eyes
open, “top of head supporting
heaven,” and to began by con-
centrating on his breathing. The
usual chronology starts with ob-
serving the breath’s dissolution
into space, followed by linking
the breath to the mind, and
through this link, the third step,
the mingling of the mind with
space. Through this, the individ-
ual is able to relate directly to
the infinity of the Universe.

student tax
projects

posed by Mike Brittin and Hal
Clarke.

The two said the proposal “at-
tempts to strengthen the com-
munity and individual elements
of W&L’s educational philosophy.
The plan challenges each student
to use his perspective, knowledge
and imagination to draw up a
workable proposal for the bet-
terment of the university.”

If the proposal is approved by
the new EC, the $5 per student
would be deducted from next
mean some belt-tightening among
year’s $30 student tax. This would
organizations now receiving
funds from that tax in an effort
to balance the budget.

This year’s budget was operat-
ed on a $17 student tax, but
for the Student Activities Board,
amounting to close to $9 per stu-
dent, came this year from out-
side sources.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

 

Allen Ginsberg

Using this as a “loosening up”
exercise for his mind, Ginsberg
is able to zero in on the working
of his brain with ease. He per-
ceives individual thoughts as they
come in and pass out of his con-
sciousness. He can also perceive
thoughts. These are the separa-
the gaps, or spaces, between the
tons of verses in his poetry.
ties with improvisational music in

His poetry has many similari-
its method of creation, for both
are based on a principle which an
ancient Eastern master distilled
as “First thought, Best thought.”
Going back and editing or chang-
ing clutters the original thought
and creates ambiguities.

Ginsberg’s subject matter
ranges from nature allegories of
the miracle of worldly existence
to sociopolitical themes. It comes
on anywhere from a_=e sparsely
worded parable to a vehement
plea for an end to militarism.
Most of what he read, or sang,
in Lee Chapel was of a socio-
political bent. This was probably,
at least in part, his reaction to
a large number of VMI cadets
sitting near the stage. He felt
his duty was to tell them some
things the rest of us have al-
ready figured out, even if we
don’t believe it all—yet.

The most open piece he pre-
sented was a poem he wrote last
fall, while he was spending some
time in the Colorado mountains,
meditating ten hours a day. It
is a free-flowing narrative in
which he follows a single breat!
around our planet. Beautifully
cyclical in structure, is is open
to interpretation on many levels.

Overall, Ginsberg’s method of
presentation was somewhat more
avant-garde than any other poet
who has visited our camus in
recent years. The use of music to
accompany the act of reading was
in itself a big change from the
usual dryness of such an event.
He is fully aware that you can
read a poem from a book any:
where at any time, and that a
gathering of people to hear poetry
is an occasion which calls for
something more.

There were a good number of
people present who seemed some:
what freaked out by Ginsberg’s
method of presentation. I only
hope their personal inhibitions
did not prevent them from appre-
ciating the freedom of the man’s
mind, People like Allen Ginsberg
don’t come here very often; we
should be very open to their way
of thinking while it is immedi-
ately available.

A letter to lacrosse fans

(Reporter’s Note: Recently
W&L lacrosse coach Jack
Emmer receiced a letter from
the student body at Cortland
State, the school from which
Emmer came to W&L. Emmer
has passed the letter along to
the Ring-tum Phi so that parts
of it may be reprinted.)

“.... The campus is buzzing al-
ready about the upcoming season,
and even now plans are being
made to make sure that Cortland

is well represented at the Wash-
ington and Lee game. Let it be
known in Lexington that the
Cortland ‘hordes’ will begin their
invasion the day before the game,
and intend to leave a ringing in
the ears of that Virginia town.
“This, by the way, is a subtle
challenge to Washington and Lee
fans to out do the Cortland faith-
ful in the fanatic department, and
on their own turf to
you at the game!”

Liberty Hall ru

By ROBERT COOK

King’s Tut Tomb it’s not, but
there is a serious archeological
dig taking place on the back acres
of the campus.

With the blessings of the Board
of Trustees Dr. John M. McDaniels
and a crew of 26 students began
this Spring to excavate the ruins
at Liberty Hall.

McDaniel believes this to be
the only archeological dig aimed
at the understanding of an educa-
tional institution.

The Liberty Hall building and
the surrounding structures were
used by the university, then
Washington Academy, from 1793
to 1803.

The site on Mulberry Hill dates
back to 1782 when the academy
noved to Rockbridge County
from Augusta County.

Exactly what there is on top,
or underneath, of Mulberry Hill
is not certain yet. After extensive
research McDaniel is unable to
conclude the exact number or
joeation of buildings which might
have served the academy.

This lack of information on the
university’s past is one area
which the dig might shed some
light on. Aside from the physical
make-up of the academy the dig-
gers will also be attempting to
learn about life of the early
instituition and its students.

So far, excavation on the site
has been limited to some prelimi-
nary trenches east of the Liberty
Hall ruins. McDaniel said he did
not expect to begin excavating
the Liberty Hall building until
next year.

Till then, this summer McDaniel
will be working with cadets from
VMI, the dig will center on the
finding and unearthing of other
major structures which composed

the Liberty Hall campus.

The students have already be-
gun to explore the outline of the
foundations of one stone structure
east of the ruins. McDaniels
would not speculate on what the
building might have been, but
records show that at least a
steward’s house, comparable with
our Commons, a rector’s house
and a dairy were part of the
campus.

Gibson to give
law lecture series

talk Saturday

George D. Gibson, partner in
the law firm of Hunton, Williams,
Gay & Gibson in Richmond and
general counsel to Virginia Elec-
tric and Power Co., will deliver
the annual John Randolph Tucker
Lecture in Law at Washington
and Lee University Saturday.

Gibson’s topic will be “Law in
the Coming Years.” The lecture,
open to the public, will take place
at. noon in Lee Chapel.

An authority in business and
corporate law, Gibson has been
chairman of several committees
of the American Bar Association

“It was simply a heads up play

Notes on lacrosse

By BILL FLESHER

Washington and Lee lacrosse
fans get a chance to help three
members Saturday when the num-
ber two ranked Generals play
host to Cortland State.

The three, head coach Jack
Emmer, goalie and co-captain
Skeet Chadwick, and midfielder
Ted Bauer, have been selected to
participate in a worldwide tour
this summer of an American All-
Star lacrosse team.

Beginning June 22, the team
will leave for Australia, where

they will play in the World Series
of Lacrosse along with teams
from Australia, England, and
Canada.

Other stops on the tour include
Hong Kong, Bangkok, Dehii,
India, and London. The team re-
turns home on July 30.

Emmer will serve as an assist-
ant to head coach Buddy Beard-
more of Maryland, Bauer and
Chadwick are two of the 26 squad
members selected bv a_ special

committee of coaches.

Here’s where the fans come in.

The United States Intercollegi-
ate Lacrosse Association, one of
the sponsors of the tour, will not
be able to come up with enough
funds to subsidize each individ-
ual’s expenses. It has been left
to each player and coach to come
up with over $2,000 to pay for
their expenses on the trip.

Saturday’s game has been desig-
nated a benefit game to raise
money to help pay for the three
team members to make the trip
Donations will be taken at the
gate and during halftime.

OPINION: “Lacrosse fever” is
raging at W&L again, and Jack
Emmer, Ted Bauer, and Skeet
Chadwick, along with the rest of
the Generals, have done a lot to
bring the student body back to
life. They’ve done what they
could over the past few seasons,
now it’s time for you to do some-
thing for them.

Winning b

By BILL AUSTIN
Scores:
W&L 1—Madison 6
W&L 5—Bridgewater 3 (1st)
W&L 3—Bridgewater 4(2nd)
(8 innings)

In games this past week, W&L’s
baseball crew hosted a pair of
VCAA tourney teams and gave
them tough times. Indeed, the
Bridgewater doubleheader was
very nearly a sweep for the Gen-
erals.

Nonetheless, solid pitching and
improved overall play could not
offset the doses of misfortune
that cursed W&L’s fate in two of
the three contests. Quite simply,
the breaks were not there. Thus,
the squad approached its final
game of the season (against
Lynchburg Baptist, to be played
at Lynchburg this afternoon) with
a so-so 7-10 won-lost mark. For
a young, inexperienced group, the
record is creditable enough, but
a far cry from the 5-0 carried
into April.

Madison College brought hopes
for an NCAA post-season bid to
Lexington last Tuesday, and
demonstrated to anyone not lur-
ed to the nearby lacrosse game
why the growing Virginia insti-
tution merited such consideration.
The Dukes can powder the ball!
However, freshman Dan West-
brook obviously believed that
bullish Madison bats could be
tamed, and with the exception of
the third inning, managed as
much in his pitching stint.

The Generals nicked Madison
hurler, Zerombo for a run in the
ist, as Tom Lancaster singled,
advanced on Bonaventura’s single
and Hathway’s grounder, then
trotted home on John Rice’s well
hit fly to centerfield.

The 1-0 lead canished in the
fateful third. In truth, the inning
might not have been so unpleas-
ant for Westbrook and company

 

had not an umpire’s vision falt-
ered at a critical moment. The
display of questionable judgment
occurred when Westbrook’s sly
pickoff move nabbed baserunner
Dalton off first base, trapping the
burly catcher in a run-down.

To save himself, Dalton crashed
into first sacker John Rice, knock-
ing the ball from his grasp by
slamming a pair of flying elbows
to his face. A call for interference
on the part of the baserunner
was imperative, but it never
came. Lyles stormed on to the
field to register a futile protest.
Dalton was back on first safely,
and Madison hitters then erupted.
The barrage included doubles by
Sample and La Cassey, two excel-
lent ballplayers, and a roundtrip-
per by the Duke’s_ shortstop,
Barbe. Five runs crossed the
plate, and the contest was Madi-
son’s.

Westbrook pitched quite well
thereafter, retiring 10 consecutive
batters in one stretch. Of note,
Coach Lyles replaced catcher Al
Burton with Maynard McCorkle,
a stocky freshman who donned a
catcher’s gear for the first time
in practice only a week earlier.
In addition to performing adequa-
ately behind the plate, McCorkle
stroked a single in his two at-bats.

The first end of the Bridge-
water twin-bill again put West-
brook on the mound. This time
he exhibited a high fast ball that
baffled Eagle batters to the tune
of 10 strikeouts in the seven-
inning game. And Generals’ bats
came through in timely fashion.
The chastized Burton, newly ap-
pointed designated hitter, deliv-
ered two base hits to lead the
assault on Bridgewater lefty
Trumbo. Don Hathway slashed a
pair of singles and stole two bases,
5-3, but Westbrook summoned his
trusty hard one to whiff two of

the final three batters faced in
the 7th.

Bob Carpentier took the mound
for the nightcap, and pitched
well giving up seven hits in his
eight innings of toil. To be sure,
Eagle bats tagged him well in the
end, and netted 3 runs. Center-
fielder Sizemore’s two-run double
keyed the uprising.

However, W&L bounced back
in the fourth. MeCorkle smacked
a long drive to center that bounc-
ed off Sizemore’s outstretched
glove and over the fence, good
for a two-run homer. Again, in
the seventh he doubled to left
to put the tying run on base.

to third on Paul Larkin’s pinch-
hit, then scored on Tom Lancast-
er’s groundball.

Unfortunately, the comeback
fell short of victory. Bridgewater
picked up a cheap run in the
eighth, when rightfielder Marsh
reached second on a_ throwing
error by Bonaventura, scurried to
third on a Carpentier wild pitch
and scored when novice McCorkle
hurled the retrieved ball into left
field. The 4-3 Bridgewater ad-
vantage held, and McCorkle had
blunted the rush for a twin-bill
sweep that he himself had launch-
ed with his bat. A hero’s laurels
and proverbial goat horns were
both his for the afternoon.

Students Affairs Committee is restructured

of the Council as follows: three
senior representatives, two junior
representatives, two sophomore
representatives, one freshman
representative, the chairman of
the Student Control Committee,
the President of the Intrafrater-
nity Council, two law students, as
well as the President of the Stu-
dent Body. The UC previously
consisted of four seniors, three
juniors, two sophomores, one
freshman, two law students, and
the President of the Student
Body.

It may also be noted that the
Council shall distribute to the
faculty reports of its policy de-
cisions for the information of the
faculty. In addition, in the case of
a student against whom the state
has preferred criminal charges
but for whom the university has
not been able to complete disci-
plinary procedures, the Student
Control Committee should con-
duct an investigation into the
charge and determine whether or
not the case warrants the suspen-
sion of a degree. The faculty
must, of course, agree with this
decision.

Along the same lines, because
the Constitution of the Independ-
ent Union remained unchanged,
the election for Independent
Union President will not be con-
ducted until next fall, if necessary
changes are made in the Inde-
pendents’ constitution.

Funds asked to send
W&L players on tour

(Continued from page 6)

The Executive Committee Mon-
day moved to donate $150 to the
fund so that the trio can go. And
that was $50 more than what was
asked for.

To be named to this team is
a great honor, and it’s a great
honor for Washington and Lee to
be represented on the squad as
they are. Bauer, Chadwick, and
Coach Emmer will go only if you
help. For all that W&L lacrosse
has meant to this school over
the past few years, a couple of
dollars Saturday shouldn’t be too
much at all.

MORE OPINION: Just because
W&L is number two in this

week’s USILA poll does not mean
that the Generals will get the sec-
ond seed in the NCAA lacrosse
tournament. Saturday’s game
with Cortland State will go a long
way in determining where W&L
starts in the tournament.

Just a few facts about the game
with the Dragons Saturday:

—Cortland has an excellent la.
crosse team.

—They have been looking for
this game ever since Jack Emmer
left Cortland and came to W&L.

—That letter from the Cortland
student body is no idle threat.
Their fans are known to be, to
put it mildly, crazy.

—And, as Emmer put it,
“They'll be here in force.”

W&L fans have rallied behind
the Generals before, and they'll
have to do it again this week. The
challenge has been issued. Now
let’s see if vou will meet it.

And, for those planning short
vacations this weekend, the beach
will always be there, but will the
chance for a NCAA lacrosse title
still be here on Saturday?

The choice should be simple.
After all, how badly do you want
the national championship?

Sazeracs to perform

The Sazeracs, Washington and
Lee’s singing fraternity, will pre-
sent a concert Tuesday night at
