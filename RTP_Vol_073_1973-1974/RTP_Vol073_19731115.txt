EC finances
chess tourney

By ROBERT PUGH

Ho hum! Yawn! The EC had its
shortest and most routine meet-
ing so far Monday night.

Dennis Oakley of the Chess
Club asked the EC to make up
any deficit in next March’s chess
tourney. He expected a profit and
added that the EC would lose at
most $200. The cash would be
used as prize money. After a len-
gthy debate, sophomore EC rep
Leland McCullough’s motion to all
W&L students. He also expects
many students from other colleges
to attend.

Student Body Vice President
Steve Greene said that last week’s
alumni conference was a great
success. The alumni especially
enjoyed the informal Friday after-
noon session, in which groups of
students and alumni met to dis-
cuss any topics of interest. The
discussion was very freewheeling
and encompassed a wide variety
of subjects.

Energy crisis to affect
even remote Lexington

By JOHN MULLIKEN

The energy crisis may seem
pretty remote to us in Lexington,
but we may soon feel the harsh
realities of this fuel shortage. The
City Council met last Monday in
special session to consider the
problem. The Council unanim-
ously passed a resolution to sup-
port the President’s guidelines
and to encourage the citizens to
do the same. While this action
may not seem like much, it in-
volves setting thermostats at 68,
turning off lights, and driving at
50; the problem is real.

Just how the crisis will effect
Lexington and the Washington
and Lee community depends on
three major factors: the weather,
the Arab embargo on oil, and the
ability of our oil refineries to
operate at maximum capacity.
The last is the most remote. Our
refineries have been operating at
near maximum capacity for some-
time now. Whether the machines
can hold up at this pace is a ques-
tion mark. No new refineries will
be in operation in the U.S. before
1975.

The weather is a more serious
problem. The optimistic catch-
phrase is “if we have a mild win-
ter.” If we don’t have a bad win-
ter, the energy crisis might not
be too much worse than last sum-
mer,

Despite an occasional incon-
venience and higher prices, we'd
be able to get gas and fuel most
of the time. However, if the Arab
embargo isn’t lifted soon, we'll
probably see gasoline rationing
before the end of the year. Mean-
while we should expect difficulty
buying gasoline at the end of each
month,

In fact, K. D. Moore said at the
meeting of the County Board of
Supervisors last Monday morn-

ing that Lexington will experi-
ence a severe shortage of gasoline
between Nov. 20 and Dec. 1. John
Love, White House energy chief
says in this same period, the na-
tion will experience an additional
shortage as the last tanker of
Arab oil, loaded before the em-
bargo, will have arrived. Stu-
dents returning from Thanksgiv-
ing vacation should expect to
have trouble buying gas, especi-
ally along major highways.

Whether or not the Arab em-
bargo continues, there is still a
strong possibility of rationing, or
its alternative—a heavy tax on
gasoline. Such a tax would run
from 10 to 50 cents a gallon (gas
costs $1.35 a gallon in Italy). Also
the President may ban pleasure
and non-essential driving. The ef-
fect would severely change the
driving habits of much of the
We&L community. Road trips may
soon become rare, and expensive.
Driving up “on the hill” may
soon be impractical, and students
living on farms may be looking
for intown apartments.

But what if we have a bad win-
ter? The outlook is dim. Ration-
ing or heavy taxes on gasoline
will be unavoidable. Driving will
‘be restricted to essential use only.
Heat oil fuel will be rationed also,
and depending on the severity of
the situation, a number of Lex-
ington homes will be cold.

If fuel oil becomes too scarce
we will probably experience an
increase in demand for electric
heaters. However, too many elec-
tric heaters could bring about
brown-outs similar to last summer
as we consume more electricity
than we can produce. Since oil
and gas heaters depend on elec-
tric blowers to distribute heat, a
brown-out could leave an entire
city without heat. For this rea-

Man still sought in dorm thefts

There have been no major de-
velopments in the solving of the
freshmen dorm burglaries nor in
the Law Dorm break-in case.

Two men, Craig R. Nelson and
Robert George Conway, were ar-
rested on Nov. 4 and charged with
breaking and entering in Baker
Dormitory. One of the men was
released on bond last week; the

second is still being held in the
city jail. A preliminary hearing
on the case has been tentatively
set for Nov. 20.

A third suspect is still being
sought for questioning in regard
to the matter. It is believed that
this person, evidently a student
at W&L, left town soon after the
incident last ewek.

In connection with the thefts in
the Old Dorm, no positive evi-
dence has been uncovered to link
them with the arrested men. A
search of one possible location of
stolen articles did not produce
any of the missing items. Efforts
are continuing to be made by the
University Proctor, however, to
recover the stolen goods and catch
the thief or thieves.

son, the sale of electric heaters
might have to be restricted or
banned.

Even if Lexington has a mild
winter, we face the possibility
of some or all of the previously
mentioned hardships, as Presi-
dent Nixon will be moving fuel
supplies into hard hit areas. The
mid-west is particularly important
because the cattle industry re-
quires propane to dry feed crops.
If that area is hard hit, we could.
see another beef shortage again
next year.

Airlines will continue to cut
flights. That could mean that a
sizable portion of the student
body could get stuck in Lexing-
ton for winter and spring vaca-
tions, especially if gasoline is be-
ing rationed. With or without ra-
tioning, gasoline prices should hit
50 cents a gallon this winter.

However far away the energy
crisis may seem, it will be very
real verv soon,

Brock: reform
in government

By TIM MOORE

In alleviating pressure on the
executive branch, Tennessee sena-
tor Bill Brock emphasized the
necessity of congressional reform
and the inevitability of campaign
law reform in an informal speech
given this past Monday night.

Speaking to a scant gathering
of W&L students, Brock said that
Congress has “the most incredible
non-budgeting system you've ever
seen in your life.” Brock, who is
chairman of the National Repub-
lican Senatorial Committee, said
that there is no structure for
Congress to have a re-evaluation
of their work which is “so despar-
ately needed.”

Touching upon three areas
of this matter, Brock first
said that the existence of

huge, unreported sums of cash
must be eliminated. Secondly,
Brock said the government was
suffering from inadequate law
enforcement in these areas, and
finally, that congressional know!}-
edge of the subject doesn't “deal!
with the fundamental problem.”

Senator Brock entertained ques-
tions from the 70-odd students
that were present and then went
to a nearby lounge for discussion.

‘Somebody got screwed up’

“You going to the lecture tonight?”

“Which one?”

“You know—Sen. Bill Brock. There were posters all over campus.
Monday, Nov. 12, at 9 p.m. in Lee Chapel.”

“No, I’m not going to that one. I was thinking of seeing the flick,
Gaslight, in Reid Hall at 7 p.m. and then listening to David Slavitt talk
about the film at 9. But if I do that, then I can’t see Clayton Fritchey
at 7:30 in duPont. I wonder why they stuck him in duPont. That place
is so small. I imagine it’ll be packed.”

“Oh does he speak at 7:30? If I go see that, then I’ll miss Bill Leach
in Lee Chapel at 7:30. I’d like to see them all. I wonder why they
scheduled all of them on the same day?”

“T don’t know. I thought the Student Activities Board was sup-
posed to coordinate everything going on around this place. Some-
body got screwed up.”

“Well, I could see where it could happen. The College Rpublicans
brought in Brock, the Fellowship of Christian Athletes brought Leach,
the J-school brought Slavitt, and Fritchey came here in conjunction
with some lecture program.”

“Yeah, but still somebody should have tried to coordinate things a
bit. The same thing happened last year when Contact, Black Culture
Week, and the Glasgow Endowment program were all bunched to-
gether. In fact, that’s why the SAB was formed.”

“Well, how about it? What lecture are you going to?”

“I’m not sure which one I want to watch now. I guess I'll bag
them all and watch Monday night football instead.”

Facing the energy crisis

It has now been one week since President Nixon has addressed the
nation on the energy crisis, and since that time various pieces of
legislation have been dutifully rushed through Congress and through
state governments to meet the President’s requests to avert an all-
out energy disaster.

And some are saying, “Yes, yes, this is good for the country. With
this plan we can all chip in and stop the energy crisis. The President
did the right thing.”

And some are saying, “Yeah, I’m all for conserving energy, but
why can’t I let the other guy drive at 50 miles per hour. Why does
this crisis have to affect me?”

And a few, a very few, are sitting back and saying simply, “I told
you so.”

Whether everyone complies with the flurry of legislation enacted
this past week to cope with the energy shortage is not the question.
The question is why haven’t we recognized this problem all along, so
that we could be moderately restricted in our energy usage instead
of encountering these “harsh,” as some call them, new controls over
our freedom to expend energy?

Why did it take a relatively short, relatively simple speech by the
Jeader of this nation to make us realize our ever-increasing energy
problem? Why didn’t we recognize the problem while we had a chance
to tackle it in its early stages, while we had a chance to impose energy
usage restrictions far milder than those which currently do and
presently will burden us?

Certainly the crisis at hand should come as no great surprise.
For literally years, we have been informed that the day will come—
and soon—when gas will have to be rationed, when heating fuel allot-
ment will be cut, when our freedom to use energy will be limited.

But no one listened. Nobody really believed that the time would
ever come in the United States when gas would cost over a dollar a
gallon, or would be rationed. Everyone sat back in the 75 degree en-
vironment of his living room, with three lights, the television, the
stereo, the air conditioner and humidifier, the kid’s Aurora race track
set, and dad’s vibrating easy chair all operating at once. Everyone sat
back and said, “Why should there ever be a real energy crisis? We’ve
got all the energy we need.”

And now, the crisis is upon us. But for most persons, the crisis
seems not to be that we are facing a severe energy shortage. Indeed,
the crisis to the average person is that he won’t be able to speed down
Interstate 81 at 80 miles per hour, that he won’t be able to get enough
gas to drive to Aspen for a Christmas vacation ski trip, and that he
has to wear a sweater in the classroom instead of his W&L Country
Club tee-shirt.

And, with the speed of a light bulb turning on, the acknowledg-
ment that there is a crisis in the United States has been realized. And
we have no reason to complain, for we brought it upon ourselves,

At least one thing is assured: we won't be able to forget about
wasting energy for awhile. The crisis, if it is ever resolved, will never
sneak up on us again. For we will be thinking of it all the time—
while we coast along at 50 miles per hour on Interstate 81, while we
sit and contemplate an early evening sunset, brought to us later
than usual because daylight savings time has been permanently im-
posed, or while we ask the service station for our weekly ration of
gasoline.

Editor’s note: Nov. 22 will mark
the tenth anniversary of Presi-
dent John F. Kennedy’s death.

By TIM MOORE

Looking back can never fully
be objective, but sometimes that
shouldn’t matter. Such times are
now, because a return may re-
mind us of the way it can be, an
idea needed so badly by a people
when drowning in the flood of
national crises. In our wintry time
of illusion, severed by bitter gusts
of anxiety, the American spirit
has been frozen like a tranquil
bond, shuddering. And we like to
think that his radiant presence,
his warm, appearance, would be
enough to thaw the cold accre-
tions, break down our frozen
blood, until these streams of life
are moving and flowering forth
again in a spring like fashion.

Jacqueline and JFK. They were
young and beautiful and Ameri-
cans. To millions of Americans
this White House couple was an
ideal. What we loved most about
them then is what we miss most
about them now: promise. And
an unfulfilled promise is like the
fish that we had on the line, but
got away.

He was young and made mis-
takes, and those he openly shared

with us. We remember the dis-
astrous Bay of Pigs and the bur-

den that he bore with it. His
vouthful courage in the face of
nuclear war only eighteen months
later stands like a monument to
those who realize it, and hardens
as leaders today fall beneath it.
He was as frank as his face to
face confrontations with Khru-
shehev, nd as war as the curious
schoolchildren’s questions, which
he wrote truly personal replies.

When his Sunday school clad
children rushed to meet his cop-
ter, led by little John in his pull-
ed up knee sox and white brim
cap, the leader became Father
and family became one. He loved
his young ones like any man
would and it was easy to forget
he was our President, and just
admire him as a father. We miss
John Kennedy and his love for
Irish songs and Gaelic poetry, his
natural and inseparable wit: they
would be energy and warmth for
us today, like a flaming torch in
a Winter blizzard.

In the words of James Reston,
“the heart of the Kennedy legend
is what might have been.” And in
the words of JFK in early 1961
speaking to the press: “This ad-
ministration intends to be frank
about its mistakes, and if we may
miss any, we want you to point
them out.”

Let us remember him. It may
give warmth to thaw our times.

Platter Chatter

Trios & Solos

By W. PATRICK HINELY
Trios & Solos
Ralph Towner with Glen Moore
ECM 1025 ST

When it comes down to it,
Ralph Towner may well be the
best guitarist around today. There
are many fine guitarists within
distinct musical genres, but what
Towner has over all of them is
breadth of style. He has all the
spiritual directness and energy of
John McLaughlin, but can also
play Brazilian, classical, straight
jazz, and he can even rock if he
wants to, though he doesn’t really
get off on pure body music. Tow-
ner also has a distinct sense of ab-
stract as well as lyrical beauty,
shown well in “Suite: 3x12,” a
group of three solos for 12-string
guitar on this album.

The album is made up of four
solos by Towner, one solo by bass-
ist Glen Moore, and four trios:
two with Paul McCandless on
oboe, one with Collin Walcott on
tabla, and a Bill Evans piece in
which Towner dubbed guitar over
his piano-bass duet with Moore.

The opening cut on side one,
“Brujo,” is the trio with Walcott
on tabla. This highly energetic
piece does conjure up images of
a Don Juan-type yaqui shaman,
much as Castaneda would prob-
ably do, if you can dig that.
(Read the books. .... ) Towner’s
guitar and Moore’s bass balance
one another almost perfectly; 10
vears of playing together is beau-
tifully obvious. Walcott on tabla
serves to accelerate the piece
even further.

Next comes “Winter Light,” a
Towner solo of great lyrical
beauty in which he may well be
paying dues to Baden Powell, the
great Brazilian guitarist. (more
about him in my next piece.)
“Noctuary” is a trio with Mc-
Candless on oboe; Moore is also
into bowing rather than plucking
his bass. It is an adventure in dis-
sonant harmonies, It is followed
by “1x12,” a Towner solo on 12-
string which explores the ground
he left untrodden in hi swork
with Paul Winter’s Consort and
Weather Report.

Closing out side 1 is “A Belt of
Asteroids,” Moore’s bass solo, The
beauty of this piece is not as obvi-
ous as the others; it lies in the
process of making the music rath-
er than exclusively in the content
of the finished product. Glen
Moore has been into true jazz (in
which the process is the content)
for a long time, and this is a fine
work in that tradition.

Side two opens with “Re: Per-

son I Knew,” the Evans piece.
Moore and Towner have both
studied piano with Bill Evans,

and the changes they lay on his
work are solid progressive im-
provements. This is by far the
most obviously beautiful cut of
the album. It started out as a duet
with Ralph on piano and Glen on
bass, but Towner’s dubbing of the
guitar adds some nice breadth
without really cluttering the

Tower of Power performs in last Friday’s concert in Doremus, along with Freddie King and Sylvester

and the Hot Band. Less than 800 attended the concert.

Tower plays a powerful show

By ROME SCOTT
There are two sides to writing
about a concert—the inside and
the outside. The inside consists of
interviews and the outside is a
review of the show.

The outside:

A good rock concert is like a
good meal and a crowd at Wash-
ington and Lee University got its
fill Friday night.

Serving up rhythm and blues as
the type of food offered, the
Tower of Power concert in Dore-
mus Gym began with Sylvester
and His Hot Band as the appetiz-
er.

The six-man band’s show began
slowly, dragging a cold audience
into the empty gymnasium, but
warmed the crowd considerably
as the group’s performance pro-
gressed.

The sparkling red coat of the
lead vocalist acted as the focal
point with an off-brand of soul-
gospel music as the background.

The main course of the con-
cert was Freddie King, a blues
guitarist stylized somewhat after
B.B. and Albert King, two blues
giants.

His show packed a punch dri-
ven by emotions seldom felt so
vividly even when put forth by
the greatest performers. And that
blues feeling went straight to the
audience’s heart.

Clapping and stomping in time
with the music, the crowd follow-
ed King’s quicksilver fingers
through weepingly melancholy
moods to the highest, brightest
joy that can be felt through hand-
worked earthy blues.

The volitant guitar phrases al-
most talked, ranging from the
softest sighs to the most savage
screams, convincing the audience
it wanted more.

Dessert, the course most desir-
ed by the participants in this con-
cert meal, consisted of a healthy
helping of Tower of Power, an

11-man from Oakland,
Calif.

A source of mellow but moving,
jazz-oriented soul, Tower put on
a powerful, beautifully tight per-
formance.

As crisp, clean and fluid as a
mountain stream, the music mov-
ed the crowd to its feet where it
stayed throughout the remainder
of the show.

The finely grained, textured
sound was produced with near
perfection in a mode of sophisti-
cated, big band rhythm and blues.

A robust blend of saxophones,
trumpets an dother brass was
flawlessly balanced with a subtle,
tight, tasteful vocal harmony and
integrated into a oneness of total
sound,

Playing their nationally rated
hits such as “It’s So Very Hard to
Go” and “Just Another Day,”
Tower of Power left an audience
that was standing, willing and
ready for another helping of the
band’s kind of dessert.

group

The inside:

Downstairs, in the dressing
room of the gym, members of the
groups not on stage wandered
about drinking cokes and other
things, tuning up and running
through parts of songs to be per-
formed.

Talk of how long the groups
had been together and where
they were touring filtered
through background noises of the
performance upstairs.

I walked over to the lead gui-
tarist of the Hot Band and made
some comment about his guitar, a
gibson stereo, gold-plated job, and
he started talking about anything
and everything.

He said the group is thinking
about breaking up, a claim back-
ed up by Sylvester—lead vocalist
in the band.

Sylvester was the most talka-
tive in the band and said he felt
the group was a_-= glitter-rock

group, fashioned along the lines
of David Bowie and Alice Cooper.

He said the band has three
levels of outrage which become
the guiding influence of a parti-
cular show depending on the na-
ture of the audience.

The show put on at Washing-
ton and Lee was the first or mild-
est level, Sylvester said, because
the band felt that was all the
audience wanted.

Freddie King’s show is pretty
much the same wherever he goes
according to the drummer of the
group.

Although King’s backup group
as it is now has been together fot
only four months they feel they
have been successful.

The pianist in the band said
King is great to work with, that
he really knows what’s going on
in music.

King said he picked up the gui-
tar from his mother and his uncle
about 17 years ago.

He got most of his blues style
from the originators of blues gui-
tar such as T-Bone Walker, Muddy
Waters and B.B. King. He puts
the three together to get a sound
of his own.

King said that what comes out
of his guitar depends on the way
he feels.

Tower of Power’s. dressing
room was a jungle of different
sounds, with saxophones, other
horns and guitars being tuned
Grabbing the nearest guy without
an instrument I ended up talking
to one of the saxophone players
who, like the rest of the group,
was glad to talk about where
they’d come from and where he
felt they were going.

I asked him how a band as
large as his (11) managed to get
the arrangements together. He
said that everyone gets to explain
and try his own ideas but that the
final arrangement comes from

Cadets boycott classes Friday

By TOM RITTENBURG
Virginia Military Institute cadets
broke the usually highly-discip-
lined, highly-organized atmos-
phere of the institute last Friday

when they called a boycott of
classes to protest an administra-
tive decision there pertaining to
the Honor System at VMI.

The problem began when the

Lexington complying
with energy problem

The Lexington City Council met
Jast Monday in a special session
and unanimously passed a resolu-
tion to support President Nixon’s
guidelines for the energy crisis.

The immediate effects of the
resolution are that all therma-
stats in the municipal buildings
will be set at 68 degrees and
lights will be turned off when not
in use. Citizens will be urged to
comply with the guidelines.

In related action, Retail Mer-
chants Association of Lexington,
acting on the advice of City Coun-
cil, said that the Christmas
lights will not be burned this
year. The lights will be put up,
but the electricity will not be
connected. The Association had
asked the Council if it would be
practical to burn the lights dur-
ing the Christmas parade. Al-
though City Manager John Doane

lights, and burning for one night
would be marginal, Vice-Mayor
Lloyd Bowling said that the City
must show leadership in _ this
emergency and advised the asso-
ciation not to connect the lights.

The resolution read, “ ... BE
IT RESOLVED that the City of
Lexington, Virginia, in the opera-
tion of the municipal facilities,
will follow the guidelines outlin-
ed by President Nixon during the
emergency period and .. . that

the citizens of Lexington, Virginia

be urged to comply voluntarily
with the guidelines ... as long as
the emergency exists.”

Earlier in the day the County
Board of Supervisors met to deal
with local energy problems. The
regional land fill has only enough
fuel to operate the bulldozer for
two days. The project is receiving
the same amount of fuel as last
vear, as ordered by the President.
However the propect was not in
full operation last year and did
not use the bulldozer. The Board
of Supervisors is seeking state
aid.

kK. D. Moore said that many per-
sons did not realize how serious
the impending fuel crisis is. He
said that Lexington faces a seri-
ous gasoline shortage between
Nov. 20 and Dec. 1.

While the strands of street lights
will not burn, the Retail Mer-
chants Assoc. plan to light the
plastic Christmas tree that will
be placed in the center of town.

VMI administration decided to
abolish the unstructured, inde-
pendent exam system at the end
of the fall term. Major E. L. Doo-
ley, Jr., director of the Public
Information Office at VMI, said
the faculty there felt independent
exams were too difficult to ad-
minister. The decision to abolish
the independent exams was re-
viewed twice and announced Fri-
day morning.

The student leaders of the boy-
cott said they felt their integrity
was questioned by the move, as
the independent exam system at
VMI, as at Washington and Lee,
is based upon the Honor System.
The president of VMI’s senior
class asked the students to return
to their barracks for 11 a.m.
classes.

Student leaders then met with
the superintendent and the com-
mandant of the institute in the
barracks to discuss the problem.
There, the administration assured
the students that their honor was
not in question.

However, a source close to the
Honor Court at VMI, which is
composed of students, said that
council recommended last year
that independent exams be termi-

nated, as they were subject
abuse by the students in regards
to possible cheating. The recom-
mendation reportedly was one of
the major reasons why the VMI
administration decided to abolish
the independent exams.

The boycott ended just three
hours after it began, as leaders of
the boycott apparently were satis-
fied with the administration’s ex-
planation of the abolition of the
independent exams.

Major Dooley described Fri-
day’s boycott as organized and
peaceful, and as not being indica-
tive of a relaxation of discipline
or traditions as the military
school. However, there have been
reports in recent weeks of grow-
ing dissatisfaction on the part of
students with the discipline of the
VMI environment.

sound as many dubs tend to do.

Next is the intellectual zinger
of the album, “Suite: 3x12,” in
vhich Towner goes even farther
than in the 12-string piece on the
first side. It’s seven minutes and
12 seconds well spent for anyone
who loves guitar.

“Raven’s Wood,” a trio with
McCandless on oboe again, follows
the suite. It is by far the most
romantic piece of the album, and
the oboe tends to make it a bit
sweeter than the Evans piece. I
can see Claude Debussy’s smiling
face in the clouds above the forest
this piece describes.

Closing out the album is “Reach
Me Friend,” another Towner solo,
and last is not least. Towner
could easily do an album with

Carlos Santana. (Not to put down
Love, Devotion, and Surrender.)

I find Trios & Solos extremely
invigorating for body, mind, and
spirit, which is about all I can ask
for from a record. It doesn’t pick
you up and fling you into the
clouds on walls of amplified elec-
tricity, but there is just as much
power in the purity of the sound.
These men are very aware of the
sounds they are creating. The al-
bum is also a new perspective on
the band colectively known as
Oregon; it presents subgroupings
quite well.

This is the kind of record I
tend to buy second and even
third copies of: the first for my-
self and more for people I love.

That person is the promoter from
Webb Productions, Gabbo Gal-

He said the arrangement he
has with W&L is to take the fi-
nancial responsibility for the con-
certs with the Student Activities
Board putting in the work.

The Tower of Power concert
was his first concert venture un-
der the arrangement and Gabbo
felt sure he had lost nearly $5,000
in the deal.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

By BILL FLESHER

For the second week in a row,
Washington and Lee ran into a
workhorse running back who ran
right past them.

Denison’s Rich Simeone gallop-
ed for 240 yards and five touch-
downs Saturday as the Big Red
outscored the Generals 49-29.

The loss was the sixth in a row
for W&L, who now must beat
Washington University this Sat-
urday to equal last season’s mark
of 3-6.

Simeone, who carried the ball
35 times, scored on runs of 46, 1,
2, 2, and 34 yards. Denison quar-
terback Dan Ross, who himself
scampered for 85 yards, threw
touchdown passes to Ken Sklenic-
ka and Ken Janiak to account for
the rest of Denison’s scoring.

Not all, however, was lost for
the Generals on a day suited bet-
ter for ice hockey than for foot-
ball.

In scoring 29 points the offense
matched its best scoring effort of
the vear (W&L posted 29 points
in the season opener against
Hamilton).

Sophomore quarterback Jack
Berry was outstanding, hitting 21
of 35 passes for 259 yards. Two of
his aerials were grabbed in the
end zone, one by Tony Perry, the
other by Ferdie Richards.

Jim Farrar, who picked up 52
vards in 10 carries, got the other

two Generals scores on a pair of
one yard runs.

It wasn’t until the fourth quar-
ter that one could call the Gen-
erals out of the game, even
though it started off as if another
rout were impending.

The first time Denison got the
ball they scored, going 56 yards
in three plays. Simeone got the
ball each time. The third play
went for 46 yards and six points.

Steve Danis kicked the first of
seven conversions, and it was
7-0.

Late in the quarter Simeone got
his second TD on a fourth and
goal from the one. The kick made
it 14-0.

Sounded
their way.

Not quite.

After taking the kickoff, W&L
marched 66 yards in 12 plays, the
big one a 19 yard pass play from
Berry to Richards. Farrar went
the final yard, and Ralph Moore’s
kick made it 14-7 .

With 1:30 left in the first half
the Generals evened things up at
14 when Berry hit Perry with a
seven yard scoring toss. The six-
pointer capped an eight play, 70
vard drive, highlighted by Far-
rar’s twenty-six yard burst
through the middle.

After recovering an_ onsides
kick attempt, Denison quickly
moved 50 yards in 80 seconds to
take a 21-14 halftime lead, with

like Denison was on

enerals outscored by Denison,
ace Washington U. Saturday

Ross hitting Sklenicka from eight
vards out.

The Big Red upped that lead to
28-14 midway through the third
period when Simeone got his third
score of the day, this time from
two yards out.

Again the Generals fought back.
They drove 67 yards in eleven
plays, with Berry and Richards
connecting for six from the five.
Moore’s kick made it 28-21.

Then the Big Red exploded—
scoring 21 points in the final
stanza to put the game away.

Simeone got touchdown num-
ber four early in the final period,
punching into the end zone from
the two.

With nine minutes left Sime-
one finished his scoring for the
day, getting his fifth touchdown
on a 34-yard ramble.

Three minutes later Farrar got
his second score of the day, and,
after Berry passed to Mark
George for the two-point conver-
sion, it was 42-29,

Then, with just :35 remaining

Ross teamed up with Janiak for
a 19 yard scoring strike which,

along with Danis’ seventh extra
point, finally closed out the scor-

ing.

For the Generals it was an
other week where half of the
team, this week the offense, play-
ed well while tht other half,
namely the defense, had its share
of problems.

Rich Simeone was among those
problems.

In their season finale on Satur-
day, the Generals travel to St.
Louis to take on the Battling
Bears of Washington University.

While W&L needs a win to
avoid a worse record than that of
1972, Washington U. needs vic-
tory to finish with their best rec-
ord in a decade.

Last year in Lexington, WU
started slowly but came on to
hand W&L a 27-7 defeat.

This week’s game can be heard
over WLUR, with the broadcast
beginning at 2:15 p.m.

Soccer team faces Navy
in season finale Saturday

By BILL AUSTIN

One week ago yesterday, Wash-
ington and Lee University’s soc-
cer team earned a tough 2-1 ver-
dict over Virginia Tech, thus
boosting its season’s record to
seven victories in ten decisions.

Played at Blacksburg, the con-
test was strongly influenced by
the less-than-ideal condition of
the field, a surface pock-marked
through overuse and neglect. The
rough terrain ruled out any sem-
blance to a smooth passing attack,
proving a powerful obstacle to
ball-contro] by either squad.

W&L gained the win despite be-
ing outshot by 27-17. Indeed, one
of the Generals’ goals was the re-
sult of a Tech fullback’s errant
boot into his own team’s nets,
Bob Crawford scored the only
other goal, providing the winning
margin.

VPI’s scoring burst did not es-
cape controversy, when the Gobb-
lers were awarded an_ indirect
free kick in consequence of goalie
Paul Devine’s alleged taking of
too many steps. The referee’s rul-
ing brought a vehement burst of
protest from W&L Coach Lyles,
but to no avail.

Basketball team preparing for season home opener

Washington and Lee’s annual
varsity-alumni basketball game
takes place this Saturday night at
7:30 in Doremus Gymnasium,

Coach Verne Canfield will send
his 1973-74 edition of the Generals
members of past Canfield teams.

Among the alumni expected to
be here for the game are Mike
Neer, Jody Cline, Norwood Morri-
son, Stu Fauber, and recent gra-
duates Mike Daniel and John
Glace (class of ’72) and 1973 grads
Doug Clelan and Ellie Gutshall.

Invitations have been extended
to several other alums, including
three members of last year’s
squad, Hatton Smith, Charlie
Strain, and captain Paul McClure.

Coaching the alumni will be
far] Edwards, who was captain
of Canfield’s first W&L team in
1966.

On Friday and Saturday, Nov.
22 and 23, the Generals will host
George Mason in a pair of presea-
son scrimmages.

The defeat of the Tech team,
the same bunch that had managed
a tie against Madison College,
came truly on the basis of a solid
defensive effort by the entire
Washington and Lee squad. How-
ever, a blending of offensive and
defensive skills is a must for this
coming Saturday’s encounter with
Navy.

The game, scheduled for 2 p.m.
at Wilson Field, carries special
significance for a couple of rea-
sons. For one, it is the Generals’
home final for the 1973 season.
Then too, it poses possibly the
toughest match of the fall season,
featuring a Navy team that boasts
a similar win-total of seven, and
a potent scoring attack.
