Rare portraits to be exhibited in Lee Chapel Friday

Sixteen 18th and 19th century
portraits from the Washington-
Custis-Lee Collections at Washing-
ton and Lee will be on special
display in Lee Chapel here be-
ginning Friday.

The paintings are all recently
restored, several by the late Rus-
sell Quandt of Alexandria and
others by Bruce Etchison who

assumed responsibility for the
restoration project after Mr.
Quandt’s death.

Included in the exhibition —

which has been prepared by the
university in connection with
ceremonies scheduled for Oct, 12
marking the designation of its
front campus as a National His-
toric Landmark—are the portraits

majority of the student body (ap-
proximately 802) must approve
it for passage.

The ballot will be split, with
several possibly controversial!
amendments separate from the
basic constitution, which is re-
latively non-controversial. Amend-
ments include adding another
freshman and law school repre-
sentative to the EC (thereby in-
creasing membership from 12 to
14), allowing exchange students
to vote, and requiring the assent
of three EC members for an
executive session.

Junior rep Bob _ Keatley’s
amendment concerning executive
sessions was approved 6-3 after a
lengthy debate. Sophomore rep
Mike Luttig advocated that sub-
ject matter for executive sessions
be delineated, but most EC mem-
bers expressed the feeling that
this could not feasibly be done.
Present rules specify that one
member may call an executive
session.

louTLOoK and REVIEW

On closed EC sessions

A battle has been won but the war is not over on the issue of clos-
ed meetings of the Executive Committee.

In last week’s editorial, we noted that there was no reference in the
student body constitution regarding the calling of such sessions after
regular EC meetings. We reasoned that there is the distinct possibility
that the EC could discuss in those closed sessions anything which it
wanted, including budgetary matters. This is not to say that the EC
was discussing such matters; we do not know that. Yet, the possibility
remains that the EC could be calling closed sessions for the discus-
sion of any issue.

Monday night the EC moved that an addition be made to the pro-
posed constitution of the student body, stating that it would take three
EC members to call a closed session after the regular EC meeting.

This is certainly a step in the right direction. According to one
EC member, two of the first three closed sessions called by the EC
this year would have possibly been eliminated by this rule. The repre-
sentative said that these two sessions were “trivial,” and that they were
called at the whim of one lone EC representative. If the proposed ad-
dition to the constitution is approved by the students next week, there
would be an end to such situations where one EC member can call a
closed session at his whim.

As we said earlier, however, the war is not over. In approving that
the above amendment be brought to the students for a vote, the EC
still missed a basic point of our editorial last week.

Even though three persons must group together to call a closed
session, there still exists the possibility that anything, including
budgetary matters, could be discussed in those sessions. We are not
saying that such matters are being discussed; we are only noting the
distinct possibility of such discussion. ,

What we are asking for is delineation within the student body
constitution as to what issues are valid as far as calling legitimate
closed sessions is concerned. We contend that closed sessions should
only be called when individual students are being discussed. Ap-
parently the EC disagrees.

The proposal to be brought to a student vote is a step in the right
direction. We hope it will be a catalyst for future action. The war is
not over. Even EC President Doug Schwartz said that the proposal
will remove only “some of the criticism and some of the abuse.” Some
maybe, but shouldn’t all of the abuse be removed? —P.J.L.

Paranoia in the faculty ranks

The defeat of the Courses and Degrees proposal to increase the
number of students in that committee from one to four comes as
a complete shock to students and administration alike, and all are
left in a state of bewilderment.

The proposal was defeated by the faculty, 46-40, in its regular
monthly meeting the first of this month.

The proponents of the proposal have been left speechless. Appar-
ently, it seemed so certain that the motion would be passed by the
faculty that forces for the proposal did not present it to the faculty
as thoroughly as they could have, The consensus was that there
would be little problem in getting the motion through the faculty for
fina] approval.

The only apparent reason for the rejection of the proposal seems
to be a paranoia among some members of the faculty. There exists
some fear that students are slowly taking over the university. The
fear is not only unfounded; it is irrelevant to the passage of the
proposal.

As it now stands, the Courses and Degrees Committee can only
pass recommendations which would go to the faculty for final
approval. The committee has no power in itself to pass proposals.
Even if the committee were made up entirely of students, there would
be no “takeover” of curriculum decisions by students, contrary to the
belief’s of certain faculty members.

The EC Monday decided to re-initiate the Courses and Degrees pro-
posal, i.e., to move it through all proper channels in order to bring
the issue to the faculty again on Nov. 5. We fully support the EC on
this move, and we hope this time that every conceivable effort will
be made to get the proposal approved this time around. —P.J.L.

TO tt

More on abortion

Sir:

To Mr. Valenzuela: The legaliza-
tion of abortion in some states in
this country has not only saved
many women’s lives, but has, in
fact, “rescued” many babies. This
world is over-populated already.
And, Mr. Valenzuela, has it ever
occurred to you that there are
literally thousands of unwanted
babies in this world leading mis-
erable existences?

I feel quite strongly that I
would not be so delighted with
this world had I been born to an
18-year-old girl with no husband
and no resources and no love.
Have you ever looked at statistics
on suicide latcly, Mr. Valenzuela?
Have you ever wondered why so
many kids have turned to that?
Some of them could have been

spared that misery by a simple
operation before their poor minds
ever began to form?

I am not, surely not, advocat-
ing any brave new world. [
tremble at the thought. Rather [
am advocating a world of sensible
people who are given every op-
portunity for happiness they can
get. Surely we are not to be a
race of mindless sheep breeding
tragedy and misery willy-nilly.
Think about it a little, Mr. Valen-
zuela,

Name withheld

Editor's Note: See Mr. Valen-
zuela’s letter in last week’s Phi.
We feel both sides of the issue
have been presented, and future
letters on this subject will face
possibility of being cut com-
pletely, due to space problems of
this paper.

Ask Traveler

Q.—Al Black is officially on the schoo] calendar. Have there been
other students in the past who have been likewise commemorated?

A.—Certainly. Back in 1938, sophomore Sluggo Sykes achieved al-
manacial fame in much the same manner as dear Al did last year,
by being forcibly carried off into the night. Sluggo, however,
never reappeared in the morning, and, as none of the student-
body owned up to his whereabouts, it was rumored that the
hapless student had been abducted by a pack of wild sheep. Even
today, Rockbridge farmers occassionally report seeing woolly
creatures, allegedly Sluggo’s progeny, wearing boat shoes and
ties and stopping motorists for directions to Sweet Briar.

In 1947, W&L panksters were responsible for the kidnaping
of one poor freshman who was so blandly inoffensive that the
next day no one could remember who he was or where they had
put him. In the Spring, the student was finally found taking
tickets at the Moose Fair carnival grounds and selling sno-cones

The practice of giving the name of a deserving student to a
certain calendar day started in the days of Gen. Lee himself. It
seems a certain voung fellow kept creeping up behind the old man
on his Sunday strolls along the Colonnade and giving very loud
imitations of a siege mortar going off. As the war seemed to have
spoiled Gen. Lee’s sense of humor, the student drew an honor
trial and was sentenced to 5 days hard labor on the Library

‘No Sweat’

Platter chatter

By W. PATRICK HINELY
No Sweat
Blood, Sweat & Tears
Columbia KC 32180

It’s been a long time since
BS&T put out an album of this
calibre; No Sweat is definitely
the best since their second album,
back in 1969. Dedicated BS&T
freaks who may have fallen away
from the band during their com-
mercial changes of the last four
vears will indeed find this album
to be music to their ears. (so to
speak.)

The only remaining original
members are Jim Fielder on bass
and Bob Colomby on drums;
Stve Katz, at long last, is gone,
and with him the underlying di-
vergence of styles that held the
band back for so long.

The new band is the strongest,
most unified musical entity BS&T
has ever been. Everyone does
their own thing, but they don’t
step on each other’s toes; the
stvles blend instead of clashing
as they used to.

Like most other BS&T records,
the album as a whole is a blend-
ing of everything that has hap-
pened in pop music in the last
couple of years. Definitely a
“melting-pot band.”

Side one is a well-assembled set
of songs. First is “Roller Coaster,”
a showcase for the horn section.

Second is “Save Our Ship,”
which almost sinks due to vapid
lvries, but is instrumentally pleas-
ing. Next is “Django,” adapted
from a piece by Django Rein-
hardt, which shows the softer side
of the band beautifully. Then
comes “Rosemary,” a Randy New-
man tune, which is the closest to
old BS&T this record gets.

Fortunately, they remember

only the good things from the old
band: heavy-duty flashy brass and
solid straight-forward rock.

Guitarist George Wadenius
comes through nicely on the cut.
“Song for John,” by reed man
Lou Marini follows. Marini’s sax
solo, together with his overall
arranging and Larry Willis’ key-
boards, make this delicate number
the best one on the album. “Al-
most Sorry” closes out the side.

Unlike most long cuts on rock
albums, this one is justified.
None of the six and a half
minutes is wasted. Everything is
in place on this one: even the
dubbed-in soul chorus vocals
sound right. Fisher’s vocal is
some of the best gutsy singing
I’ve heard, and Willis’ piano work
approaches perfection. The horn
players, as usual, are exact.

Colomby’s drumming,
similar vein, is accurate if not
innovative. Fielder on rhythm
guitar makes his presence worth-
while; it is unfortunate that his
bass playing on the rest of the
album gets lost somewhere down
in the mix.

it

Side two has its high points,
such as the opener, “Up Against
the Wall,” which must have cut
the same day as “Rosemary.”
Marini puts his twist on the
BS&T instrumental-jam format
with “Hip Pickles,” but the side
also contains a weak arrangement
of “Empty Pages,’ and two un-
outstanding numbers which seem
to be the Steve Katz legacy.

Though Katz left the band after
helping muddle New Blood, his
general sad-song influence re-
mains in “My Old Lady” and
“Mary Miles.” But then, no album
is perfect.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

By ROME SCOTT

Pianist Robert Silverman open-
ed the Washington and Lee Uni-
versity Concert Guild season Mon-
day night with flair and a show
of musical excellence that might
well stand as the level to achieve
for the remainder of the series.

Playing with an easy-going, al-
most off-hand, style, Silverman’s
performance was characterized by
an underlying intensity born out
of an emotional involvment with
his music.

He projected the moods of such
diverse pieces as  Copland’s
Piano Sonato (1941)” and
Chopin’s “Nocture in D-flat, Opus
27/2” with equal perceptiveness
of each composer’s intention.

‘Silverman’s precision at the
keyboard did not result in tech-
nically forced music but gave
each selection a life of its own.

From the whimsically light
“Sonata ‘No. 50 in C Major” by
Haydn to the crashingly disonant
“Variations Pour Piano” by Hetu,
Silverman showed a sensitvity of
musical interpretation that did
not betray the worth of any piece
on the program.

them, Silverman added the depth
of rational understanding to the

when heard.

The flawlessness of Silverman’s
performance intrigued the Lee
Chapel-packing audience and it
refused to let him leave without
an encore.

Rachmaninoff’s “Moment Musi-
cal No. 3 in D minor” topped off
the concert with a perfection that
left no doubt of Silverman’s bril-
liance.

The Ring-tum Phi talked to
Michael Brittin, chairman of the
new Student Activities Board,
about a new plan to bring top
quality entertainment to Wash-

Recent experience proved the
unfeasibilitv of the “Dance Plan”
program, and the Board worked
hard in pursuit of alternatives.

The creation of the Student
Activities Board (SAB) saw also
the birth of the Entertainment /
Recreation Committee, chaired by
Doug Chase in conjunction with
John Embree and Robert More-
cock.

Acting as part of the SAB, this
subeommittee worked with a Mr.
Willard Galbereath, known. all
over the East Coast as “Gabbo.”
A professional promoter, Gabbo
has worked with the Rolling
Stones, Jethro Tull, and other
big names in music.

Gabbo will assume all financial
responsibilities, both profit and
Joss—thus removing a_ great
burden from the Student Body
economy.

Looking for a good place to eat
in Lexington? Looking for some

a place which retains fond

Walk for hunger set;
take off on Saturday

This Saturday, the Hunger
Walk will take off for a second
year. The hike is sponsored by
the Ministerial Association of Lex-
ington and Buena Vista. It takes
no money to participate in this
cause. Instead, each walker gets
others to sponsor him. His spon-
sors agree to pay him a set
amount for every mile he walks.
The proceeds from the walk will
go to relief work: 50% will go to
the Rockbridge Area Relief As-
sociation, which provides emerg-
ency help for the poor in this
area, and 50% will go to CROP,
the Community Hunger Appeal of
Church World Service, which uses
the money in its world-wide relief

program.

An NBA preview:

By JOHN ELLIS

NBA basketball hits the courts
(egal battles aside) this week. A
review of the NBA’s situation is
due—and a_ projection (sports-
writers always need an excuse,
any excuse to fill a column).

The NBA embarks on its 25th
season missing several things: a
clear favorite for the title, Wilt
Chamberlain, a dynasty in power,
and the urge to merge with the
rival league. Each of these miss-
ing factors will have detrimental
effects on the coming season, as
the past tones the future in other
matters.

No one can ciaim to hold the
pre-season favorite role. Eastern
divisions fans will pick between
New York and the rejuvenated
30ston team. Both clubs place
their hopes on aging stars. New
York offers Dave DeBusschere,

moves over from Buffalo in ex-
change for sweet-shooting Jim
MeMillian. Alas, the Lakers also
must rely on a performer of many
years, Jerry West, one who very
reluctantly signed on for another
grueling season. To be sure,
Golden State or Phoenix are cap-
able of p!:aving championship ball,
wheneve: cither team pulls its
brilliance together into cohesive
unit.

Elsewhere, midwesterners will
wait anether vear for the Mil-
waukee dynasty to flower, or will
try to keep track of Nate Archi-
hald’s record-setting play.

This somehow brings the analy-
sis to Wilt Chamberlain. The tall
one swaved under the burden of
great lumps of money and will
find himself playing in a 3200
seat capacity gym. Moreover, Wilt
will surely find himself pushed
and shoved in the ABA, where
officials wear blinders. He will,
worst of all, find himself coach-
ing the San Diego Conquistadors.
An interesting sidelight emerges
with this last development an
adage of the NBA says Chamber-
lain is hard to coach. In his new
position of player-coach, how will
he handle himself?

about—like helping out the center
on defense. Indeed, L.A. and the
NBA will suffer more from the
move than Wilt.

‘Next? No dynasty. Since the
great Boston teams of the last
decade (headed by Bill Russell,
now Seattle’s coach), no team has
mustered back-to-back champion-
ships, or even two in a three year
span. New York has some close
(two out of four years), and Los

Angeles, with Wilt, tried vali-
antly. The best chance for a
future dynasty lies with Mil-

waukee. It may never develop,
but, with Kareen Abdul-Jabbar in
the middle, the Bucks have the
most resilient power at present.

Hampden-S

Washington and Lee football
coach Bill McHenry should have
known he might be in for a long
night last Saturday, after the van
carrying the W&L “advance
party” broke down on the way to
Lynchburg.

It went downhill from there in
the Hill City as McHenry’s Gen-
erals were pasted, 42-6, by a fired-
up bunch of Hampden-Sydney
Tigers in the Jaycee-sponsored
game in Lynchburg’s City Stad-
ium.

“We were soundly beaten by a

better football team,’’ Coach Mc-
Henry noted. “They were well-
prepared in every aspect of the
game.

Another tip-off came when the
opposing Hampden-Sydney squad
burst out of its dressing room and
literally trampled several of its
own players.

“We were certainly disappoint-
ed with our performance,” Mc-
Henry continued. “But rather
than look back on the mistakes
we made, we are looking forward
to redeeming ourselves this Satur-

The Washington and Lee Rugby
Football Club centured to Wash-
ington, D.C., this past weekend
engaging the powerful George-
town Hoyas.

The ruggers were only able to
filed one side for the match, con-
sequently, they faced a fresh
Hoya team in each half. Amidst
a flurry of penalties, the George-
town “A” team rucked over the
Generals, 11-4. Georgetown “B”
also won, 13-0. The Washington
and Lee try was scored by Jim
Kahn as he fielded a kick that
was blocked by Bob Cooke.

Washington and Lee has one
advantage over most other east-
ern schools. Its setting in the
heart of the Blue Ridge Mountains
puts us just minutes away from
a myriad of possible activities.
Most of us, however, have either
never taken the time or realized
the opportunities that such a set-
ting allows. Now we have the
chance.

The W&L Outing Club will hold
its initial meeting tonight in
Rooms 112 and 113 of the Student
Union. Club members will be able
to enjoy trips in hunting, fishing,
canoeing, spelunking, skiing, and
more.

The spearhead of the group is
Anthropology Professor John Mc-
Daniel with inspiration from the
Darmouth Outing Club, Not only
will the W&L group provide both
freshmen and upperclassmen with
a new perspective on what the
surrounding countryside has to
offer, it will give new life to the
average W&L man’s weekend.

The emphasis will be placed on
Rockbridge County, but there will
be trips to many parts of Virginia
and to nearby states.

For the third week in a row,
W&L will face a team which lost

tongue-in-cheeked McHenry.

teams have not met since 1969,
when Howie Stevens led R-M to

NBA: full of

questionmarks

(Continued from page 6)

NBA’s hope chest is the urge for
a merger. Two leagues cost
money, and lots of it. As an ex-
ample, Ernie DiGregorio signed
for $2.3 million. The NBA hat lost
Chamberlain and Dave DeBus-
schere’s administrative talents to
the nearby Nets for next season,
and will certainly drop a bundle
more cash on next year’s college
draft. Bill Walton will surely fol-
low the legion of UCLA players
who have reaped riches from the
bidding war of grasping leagues.
With such thoughts as these of-
fered for contemplation, the mus-
ing ends. In summary, the NBA’s
1973-74 season will not be out-
standing, not if the past is any
prelude. Troubles lie ahead.

‘No Sweat’

(Continued from page 3)

“Inner Crisis” closes out the
album. It is Willis’ tour-de-force;
the man has been listening to
Rachmaninoff, it would seem.
But that’s not all, for it turns
into a full-fledged rocker. He has
more in his head than BS&T can
fit into their framework, but he
makes himself fit. So do all the
others.

Blood, Sweat and Tears has
proven that commercially-orient-
ed music can sound good.
