EC endorses credit card
use in W&L Supply Store

By ROBERT PUGH

Monday night the EC endorsed

soph. David Braun’s _ proposal
which would allow Bank Ameri-
card and Master Charge to be

used in the Co-op to charge every-
thing but food.

Under the proposed plan, the
First National Exchange Bank
would send representatives to
W&L to sign students up for
their cards. Parents would be
notified, but not consulted, that
their son or daughter had applied.
The initial charge limit would be
8250 per month, but the limit
would gradually be revised up-
ward. The plan now goes to Mr.
Toler (manager of the Supply
Store, Mr. Whitehead (University
Treasurer), and bank officials for
final approval.

Student Body President Doug
Schwartz announced that nomina-
tions for Who’s Who in American
Colleges and Universities are due
by 6 p.m. Sunday. They should
be placed in the EC Box or given
to an EC member. Undergradu-
ate seniors and law school seniors

Student injured
in auto crash

Robert Lane Fertig, class of
1975, is listed in critical condition
in a Roanoke Hospital following
an automobile accident last Fri-
day around midnight.

Details of the accident are
sketchy. Fertig was apparently a
passanger in the car which crash-
ed six miles north of Covington
on Rt. 220.

No other details were available
at press time.

are eligible for the 26 positions.
Any student can nominate. Un-
dergraduate, non-senior members
of the EC, UC, and class officers
will choose the undergraduate
seniors, and the Student Bar As-
sociation will select law school
seniors for the award. The under-
graduate screening committee
meets Monday at 8 p.m. in the
EC room.

The EC is considering a pro-

Brockman trial

on 2 charges
set Dec. 10

Charles Butler Brockman, 50,
associate professor of romance
languages at Washington and Lee,
will be brought to trial Dec. 10
on two counts of contributing to
the delinquency of a minor.

The charges stem from a pair
of sworn warrants alleging that
Brockman gave hashish to two
juveniles, a 12-year-old boy and a
14-year-old girl, Saturday, Oct.
13.

The trial will take place in
Rockbridge County Juvenile and
Domestic Relations Court. Judge
James M. Davidson will preside.

Brockman was arrested the
Monday following the alleged in-
cident by the Lexington Police
Department. He was released on
$4000 bond.

NOTICE

The W&L_ Republicans will
hold a general meeting Sunday,
Dec, 2, at 8 p.m. in Room 114 of
the University Center. There will
be a special election to fill a va-
cancy in the position of Secretary-
General.

posal to ask the school’s Finan-
cial Aid Committee to eliminate
car value as a deduction from fi-
nancial aid. They feel that a car
is now a necessity, not a luxury,
and believes this would remove a
major disadvantage with which
scholarship students must con-
tend. Van Pate, Director of Stu-
dent Financial Aid, will meet
with the EC next Monday night
to discuss the situation.

The EC also revised the proce-
dure for honor trials to allow
opinion to be considered as well
as fact. Most members expressed
the feeling that considering opi-
nions to be inadmissable greatly
restricted the EC in handling
cases. Additionally, members will
be allowed to vote only after all
discussion has ended, and the
“reasonable doubt” clause has
been read.

In other business, the EC de-
cided to set up a timetable for
working up a plan to encourage
the Board of Trustees to make a
Fine Arts center the next build-
ing constructed on the campus.
The plan will be submitted at the
Jan. 11 Board meeting.

Apollo astronaut to lecture
on psychic phenomena

Navy Captain Edgar Mitchell,
Se. D., the sixth man to set foot
on the moon, conducted telepathy
experiments from outer space and
now, as President of the Institute
of Noetic Sciences, explores the
“inner spaces” of the human
mind.

Two documentary films on cur-
rent scientific investigations of
KE. S. P. and related subjects
which were produced under the
direction of Capt. Mitchell, will be
shown Thursday, Nov. 29, in du-
Pont Auditorium at 7:30. The total
running time is about one hour.
There is no charge,

The films are entitled “Inner
Spaces” and “The Ultimate Mys-
tery” and cover a wide range of
spontaneous and laboratory con-
trolled psychic phenomena.

Highlighted are experiments by

the lie detector expert, Cleve
Backster, which suggest that a
form of consciousness exists in

plants and simple bacteria cells;
a demonstration by Dr. Justa
Smith, a University of Chicago
trained bio-chemist, of ensymic
changes caused by a_healer’s
hands; and studies of “out-of-the-
body” experiences in the labora-
tory of Dr, Karlis Osis.

Development and the fine arts LETT

Washington and Lee is currently in the midst of a $56 million de-
velopment drive which, besides having already given us new Dore-
mus, will give us a new law school, a new library, new dorms, restora-
tion of the front campus, and $22 million in endowments if all goals
are reached by 1979. But it will not, as currently planned, give us a
fine arts center.

The need for such a center is apparent if we view the current
deplorable situation here in regards to the arts and the burgeoning
growth of art, drama, and music departments in recent years, par-
ticularly since the curriculum changeover to a 12-12-6 system in 1970.

In 1969-70, there were 11 “fine arts” junior and senior majors, as
they were termed before art, music, and drama were departmentaliz-
ed each unto its own. Now there are more than double that number of
majors at latest count. And music isn’t even offered as a major yet.

But the total enrollment in the fine arts at W&L truly reflects
their growth here. Enrollment figures have nearly doubled in the fine
arts since 1969-70. There were 15 art courses in that school year with
a total enrollment of about 525 students; there were six drama courses
with 100 enrolled; there were seven music courses with about 175
students in those courses. Last year, the figures were as follows: 900
enrolled in 20 art courses; 250 in nine drama courses; 375 enrolled in
19 music courses.

In addition, five fine arts courses offered last year had an enroll-
ment of over 100 students, while another eight had over 40 studnts.

Thre are but four bona fide art, two drama, and two music pro-
fessors at Washington and Lee.

There are but four bona fide art, two drama, and two music pro-
has very little stage room, and is comparable in sturdiness to many
of the barns one may see along Rt. 39 traveling toward Goshen. One
wonders how they stand. That, essentially, is the facilities of the
Drama Department at Washington and Lee.

Music is treated equally well here. There are six listening devices
for records up in McCormick (you can be assured that normally no
more than four are working at any given period before a listening
quiz in a music course). There are also practice rooms in the Univer-
sity Center, as well as a classroom. And those facilities are adequate,
at best, for the ever-expanding music department here.

Art is primarily centered in duPont Hall. The “studio” seats about
25 at the most for any one course, and there are always at least 25
students in most of the studio courses, with a mile-long waiting list
hoping someone already in the class develops a conflict in his schedule.

And there is no hope for relief as seen in the framework of the de-
velopment program drive, which may seem surprising to some since
the fine arts was listed as of the highest priority in a university self-
study back in the 1960’s.

What the university needs is some sort of fine arts center. The
problem is that the fine arts personnel just can’t seem to agree on
the definition on what a fine arts center should be. Music wants one
thing, drama another, and art still another.

On top of this we must consider a minimal $4-5 million in cost for
the building, which would have to be added to the $56 million cur-
rently sought.

It is not simply a matter of priorities. The current building pro-
gram has been proceeding in a set fashion more because of circum-
stances rather than priority. Certainly a new library would take pre-
cedence over a new gym in the eyes of most, but the circumstances
were such a few years ago where a new gym was easier to build than
a new library. And so it was, and so the current building program
continues. An alumni gift might make circumstances conducive to a
fine arts center, But the alumni don’t know of any need for such a
center.

The hawkers of the development program—the men who are trying
to sell the idea of the alumni to raise money—can do something about
this problem. Since the development program’s unveiling in February,
1972, the men behind the program have been trying to sell it as if it
were a custom-made model specificially designed for the university;
cut-and-dry, with no options available.

Instead, these men should solicit funds with a certain flexibility
to the program—offer the alumni several options as to what to donate
money toward in the development program. Offer the standard model
development program, if you will, but offer the optional extras such as
a fine arts center, added journalism facilities, or whatever else could
be built as an integral part of Washington and Lee.

The Lewis Law Center has already been provided for by an alum-
nus who saw something he liked in the development program. Why
not offer the chance for another graduate to bestow his name and
money upon a fine arts center?

Rockbridge area relief

program is explained
Dear Sir:

The members of the Rockbridge
Area Relief Association (RARA)
wish at this time to make a re-
port on our progress to the com-
munity. Perhaps the easiest way
to understand what RARA is do-
ing is to know that RARA has
three functions: (1) a food closet
in Good Shepherd Lutheran
Church administered by the Rev.
Terry Clark, (2) a clothes closet
in Trinity Methodist Church ad-
ministered by the Rev. Philip
Hunsicker, and (3) the disbursing
of voluntarily contributed funds
and services administered by Vi-
vian Buchanan in the social serv-
ices office. The three functions
are not only mutually supportive
but are kept in close communica-
tion with each other.

The food closet received $100
from RARA funds and $395 con-
tributed directly by private in-
dividuals. The shelves of the food
closet have been stocked with this
money. To use the food closet, a
person must be first screened
through social services or Reach
Out.

The clothes closet reports that
it is very busy. Phil Hunsicker
said that at this time of the year,

TO THE RV

upwards of 20 people a week are
coming to look for clothes.

The third function, which is to
provide funds to alleviate emer-
gency crises, has likewise been
very busy. Since January of 1973
through October 24, $2028.23 was
contributed on a voluntary basis.
$1949.37 was dispensed, helping
a total of 111 people ($100 of that
went to the food closet). Expendi-
tures were for such items as medi-
cines and prescriptions, doctors,
rent and moving and shelter, gro-
ceries before there was a food
closet, dentist, hospital, therapy,
water bills, heat and electric bills.

All in all, that means that you
the public have contributed ap-
proximately $2423 eiher directly
to RARA or to the food closet or
in the CROP march, have donat-
ed hundreds and hundreds of cans
of food and many, many articles
of clothing to help many, many
people of this community with
their crises—perhaps as many as
four or five hundred. We, of
course, hope that you will con-
tinue your generosity and sup-
port. Contributions may be made
to RARA, c-o St. Patrick’s Church,
Lexington, Va.

Thank you one and all.

Jack Behen
President, RARA

Student participation heavy
m community aid projects

Are Washington and Lee stu-
dents interested in community
service? Statistics say yes.

“Over 125 students are doing
regular weekly volunteer service
work this semester,” stated Ken
Lane, University Federation ad-
viser. “We are extremely pleased
to see this kind of community
support from Washington and
Lee students,” he added.

According to Lane, the Big
Brother program has 25 volun-
teers. This project matches each
student volunteer with a child in
the community who needs addi-

tional companionship and
sonal attention.

Another University Federation
program is tutoring in the local
school] system. There are 70 stu-
dents in this program, Lane stat-
ed, along with 25 community vol-
unteers which the University
Federation has recruited.

In addition, the Western State
Cental Hospital project has 13
volunteers from Washington and
Lee and the Virginia School for
the Deaf and Blind has five vol-
unteers.

Candlelight service revived;
scheduled for December 5

The University Christmas Can-
dlelight Service used to be a re-
gular feature here in Lexington
around Christmas time. Given
right before the Christmas break
at Washington and Lee, it com-
bined a program of Christmas
carols along with the reading of
the Christmas story by W&L fac-
ulty.

When exams were switched to
before Christmas in 1970, the
schedule prohibited a concert,
since the last few weeks were
now to be spent finishing up the
semester and taking exams.

Last year the Washington and
Lee University Federation reviv-
ed the concert, and this year they

will again be sponsoring the:serv-
ice,

“It had gotten to be a sort of
tradition here at W&lL,” said
Floyd Lewis, U.F. president. “The
students, faculty and townspeople
looked forward to it every year.
We couldn’t let the schedule
change force its end.”

The concert will be held next.
Wednesday, December 5, at 7 p.m.
in Robert E .Lee Memorial Ep’‘s-
copal Church. It is open to the
public and is free. Collection
plates will be passed for dona-
tions. All proceeds will go to the
Childrens Winter Clothing Drive.

The nine readings will be donz
by administrators, faculty mem-
bers and students.

Where your tuition dollar goes

By PAUL MORELLA

Tuition has been rising astrono-
mically at Washington and Lee,
increasing by 25% in just the last
four years. As it turns out, this
rate is fairly commensurate with
most other private universities.
The question remains, however,
where does the money go and
how does tuition fit into the total
W&L budget.

Out of a $2,500 tuition cost for
the 1973-74 school year, 67.8% of
this figure is devoted to instruc-
tional expenses. In addition, 13.2%
is going towards plant operation
and maintenance, 10% for student
and public service, 5.9% towards
administrative expenses, and the
remaining 3.0% is used for alum-
ni and general expenses.

Tuition and fees account for a
total of 65.8% of the educational!
and general revenues of W&L,
while 16.8% comes from endow-
ment income, 6.8% from alumni
funds and the remainder of the
income coming from additional
funds, and gifts. Also, auxiliary
enterprises net a total of $1,125.-
000 towards the budget but re-
quire an expenditure of $1,069,-
oS6 to operate,

This budget, however,
reflect income or

does not
expenditures

for restricted purposes that may
be received during the 1973-74
fiscal year.

Over the years, more and more
of the budget is being devoted to.
wards the educational and gen-
eral budget. For example, in the
1960-61 school year, 44% of the
$750 tuition fee went towards the
educational and general budget,
while 65% of the tuitional costs

will be spent for the ’73-’74 school

year.

In addition, enrollment has been
increasing steadily over the years
growing from 1,163 for the ’60-’61
school year to 1,639 for this schooi
year.

A breakdown of educational
fees towards each separate de-
partment was unavailable from
the university treasurer.

Ask Traveler

Q—The energy crisis letter to all students seems to confirm the actual
existence of President Huntley. Is there such a person or did a
J-School professor ghost-write that letter?

A—President “Bob” Huntley, the man once described as a cross be-

tween The Invisible Man and a young Ward Bond,

is not the

myth that most people believe. He lives and breathes as an integral
part of the University, and, although he has been listed by the
Dept. of the Interior in between the blue heron and Bigfoot as
America’s fastest vanishing breed, Pres. Huntley has successfully
guided W&L, over the years, through the shoals of college man-

agement.

Fund-raising, alumni activities, high echelon correspondence—
these presidential duties are thankless, glamourless, behind-the-

scene-duties. No wonder,
at different times,

Pres. Huntley has mistaken on campus,
as a third

year law student, Quarter Man,

and the Xerox repairman. Such is the price the monarch pays in
the kingdom of the blind, though his effectiveness never wavers.
The recent letter advocating energy conservation is ample evi-
dence of the man’s firm yet unobstrusive leadership of W&L.

Q—yYes, but what does he look like?

A—Well, if I can remember some of those Wagon Train shows .

Inside-Out

 

 

By ROME SCOTT

There’s an old saying, “every-
hody’s out of step but Johnny.”
In this case I’m Johnny.

“Jesus Christ Superstar” has
‘been panned by nearly every film
critie of any consequence in
America, usually as a blasphem-
ous protest production.

The unusual thing about the
claim is that everybody’s scream-
ing, not just those who believe
Christ was God incarnate but
those who believe Jesus was just
another man as well.

What an amazing film to be so
flexible in potential interpreta-
tion as to raise opposition from
two groups who usually oppose
each other’s point of view.

How can both sides be right?
Either it does portray Christ as
an ordinary man or it doesn’t.

That’s the beauty of the movie
—the viewer can make it say any-
thing he wants it to. That is the
reason two groups can hate the
same film for two diametrically
opposed sets of ideas.

Aside from being an ultimately
malleable movie, the production
technique gives “Superstar” a
grandeur of visuals, combined
with sound, not seen since “The
Sound of Music.”

Set in a desert among ruins, the
possibility of blandness of color
and gracelessness of scenery is
ignored so that vibrance and awe-
someness arise amid the rubble.

Christ’s table-turning escapade
in the temple takes on a vivid
meaning and “Get out” feels as
well as hears.

The question of man or God be-
comes moot as the depth of be-
trayal of an entity who believes in
what he’s doing intensifies.

Judas’ struggle takes on a Clar-
ity not gotten from church ser-
mons in which he is made out to
be a devil, or talks in the temple
where he is a black eye to theo-
logy.

One comes to see that Judas
was just a man with human weak-
nesses.

The excellent quality of the
acting is overwhelming. Every
character plays his part complete-
ly within character.

A totally enriching experience
no matter what personal beliefs

a viewer might have, “Superstar”
is entertaining, meaningful, as-
tonishing.

As for the other critics I say,
“forgive them, for they know not
what they do.”

Editor’s note: The following art-
icle is reprinted from the Thanks.
giving edition of the Birmingham
News.

Close to 2500 stayed up way
past most bedtime hours to hear
the funkiest and bounciest bundle
of bright beat to come from an
Alabama-born group.

Wet Willie’s Concert at the
Alabama Theatre on Thanksgiv-
ing Eve confirmed the five-man
band’s right to a big piece of the
rock world’s limelight.

Even before the group was on
the stage, the audience was on its
feet, clapping in anticipation of
the best hard blues boogie rock
a now-band can deliver.

Deliver Wet Willie did too,
pounding out a colorful combina-
tion of counterpoint rhythms in-
sistently enough to move even
the most sluggish of the post-mid-
night crowd.

The no-gimic group generated
a bucket full of excitement seem-
ingly without effort.

And the most natural of all the
group members was lead singer,
Jimmy Hall.

The Mick Jagger look-alike

Les Grandes Dames de Lexington—

Last of the vanishin g breed

By J. E. B. BEAVER

Most young men as _ students
spend their college days sowing
a few wild oats, having fun with
the girls and indulging in the
vices that become their age so
well .While all this is well and
good the average student does
not include enough variety in his
social and sexual life.

For example, one area of inter-
est which has been ignored by all
but a few brave youngsters is
Lexington society. It is amazing
that something so colorful and
intriguing could be ignored by a
student body which seems to
have an insatiable thirst for so
many ordinary vices.

Lexington is glutted with un-
usual types of people and differ-
ent life styles. Beneath the sur-
face of gentility and charm lies a
whole world which is far from
prosaic. Each segment of society
has its own passion for life ex-
pressed in a different way. The
group of elderly dowagers and
spinsters of the community pro-
vide an interesting example of
the life of which most students
are totally ignorant.

Miss X was a queen of local

society who led quite a revealing
life. As a young woman in the
1890’s she was sent to Paris to
study art. Her study soon became
divorced from the fields of art
and architecture as she tried to
make her life a work of art in it-
self. Perhaps this lady’s most im-
pressive close contact was Zola
whose mistress she was for a
period of time.

When youth and beauty began
to fade she returned to this hill-
billy haven to spend her last
years. Toward the end she began
to carry on long conversations
with her dead sister to which a
W&L student was witness,

Another case worth looking in-
to is the history of the Grissi sis-
ters. These ladies were engaged
to VMI cadets in the 1920’s but
their young men escaped wedlock
and left the sisters high and dry,
so to speak. The Grissi _ sis-
ters then went into a retirement
of shabby gentility. They lived in
a house in town which afforded
them some entertainment, how-
ever. On Sunday mornings they
could be seen perched in their
windows watching the parade of
cadets marching to take the sacra-

Automatic rule notice

The Committee on the Automa-
tic Rule will meet at 10:30 a.m.
on Tuesday, December 18, 1973.
At that time the Committee will
consider the following groups of
students, who have fallen under
the Automatic Rule, for possible
immediate reinstatement:

1. those students who failed
meet the conditions of
Academic probation  re-
quired of them at the end
of the current Fall Term;

2. those students completing
a full academic year who
failed to meet the cumu-
lative average required of
their class.

students who fall under the Auto-

to inform the committee of exten-
uating circumstances present in
his case, he may write a letter to

lege before the time of the Com-

his parents will receive notifica-
tion.

ment, making obscene noises and
gestures .

Being Southern belles, they
were constantly trying to keep
up appearances. One of their
many idiosyncrasies was the
habit of raking the leaves at four
in the morning. This was done be-
cause they could not afford to
pay someone else to do the chore
but were unwilling to face the
humiliation of letting everyone
actually see them getting their
hands dirty.

Typical of the local spinsters
were the four old Misses Lymph.
The youngest of the group fin-
ally nursed all the others to the
grave. Being alone she awaited
death anxiously and when the
good Lord refused to grant her
request took matters into her own
feeble hands. At 75 she attempted
suicide and blew it. An affection-
ate student finally stopped Miss
Lymph from her fumbling. at-
tempts.

Many of these elderly grand
dames stubbornly fought to hold
on to the pleasures more char-
acteristic of the young. Miss Scar-
lett Beaubut was such a one. She
became enamoured with a W&L
student and invited him over for
tea one afternoon. After some
light conversation she decided
that the young man was worthy
of her exceedingly desirable com-
pany. She generously offered to
leave him her palacial home and
wealth if he would marry her.
The student kindly declined the
offer of his 85 year old hostess.
She then offered all her treasures
if he would only sleep with her.
Again he refused.

Miss Beaubut was not to be
frustrated easily. She insisted that
he take her collection of antique

china for his presence in her bed-
room. This he also felt: necessary
to decline. Lastly she promised
him an antique commode for 4
kiss and he accepted.

Many of these ladies lived in
the past and refused to conform
to the standards of modern soc-
iety. Mrs. Gramont Berry decided
in 1905 that she liked the current
dress styles and that if the styles
soon called for short dresses it
would eventually return long
dresses to favor. With this in
mind she bought an immense
wardrobe in 1905 which lasted
her until the end of her days.
While young women turned to
mini-skirts in the sixties she
could still be seen parading
through downtown Lexington in
skirts coming down to her ankles.

Mrs. Berry can also be remem-
bered for her generosity. It was
she who gave her collection of
the letters of Lord Alfred Doug!as
to the public library in Big I[s-
land.

Most of these dear ladies have
now departed this life but they
should not be forgotten. Their

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

By BILL AUSTIN

In assessing Washington and
Lee’s basketball fortunes for the
coming season, there exists no
= ick mode of summary, no easy
means by which-to predict victory
totals, or to herald misfortune.

Rather, this year’s squad poses
an intriguing puzzle for any sort
ot analysis. The key to this enig:
ma is the team’s overall vouth.
Only two seniors are among re-
turning players. Yet, in the final
evaluation, this very factor may
spell a real opportunity for im-
provement over last year’s .500
record.

Regardless of the number of
victories or defeats amassed, the
brand of basketball played wiil be
exciting, for Coach Canfield plans
an extensive employment of the
fast-break offense, complemented
bv a pressing, man-to-man de-
fense.

His reasoning for the changed
philosophy is sound, necessary.
The current squad boasts both
depth and speed, essential tools in
the forging of a running, ball-
hawking bunch. Hopefully, the
stepped-up tempo on the court
will improve the shooting percein-
tage that too often hovered under
40% last year. By not allowing
opposing teams to set up their de-
fenses, the Generals should enjoy
a better shot selection.

A vital part of the fast-break
scheme is rebounding. Norm Kris-
toff, the sophomore center plagu-
ed by injuries last year but never-
theless a potential cog in the
W&L attack, emerges as the pivo-
tal figure under the boards. If he
can duplicate his performance of
last Saturday’s scrimmage against

George Mason in which he collect-
ed 18 points and snared 20 re-
bounds, a sizeable portion of this
season’s puzzle will be solved.
Kristoff possesses a quickness
rare for one his size (6’9”); utili-
zation of his speed will ultimate-
ly determine the team’s chances
to maintain a fast pace offen-
sively.

Skip Lichtfuss and Guy Kerr
must share rebounding cheres
with Kristoff, aided substantiaily
by Gary Fitzgerald, the team’s
best leaper. The fast-break tempo
should again help, as it will af-
ford these quick, not-so-tal! for-
wards with an edge in positioning
themselves for follow-up shots.

Obviously, the scoring burden
rests heavily on Lichtfuss, the
senior forward who averaged just
under 20 points per game last sea-
son. In the recent Alumni-Varsity
game, he contributed 28 points in
leading the current Generais to
an 87-73 romp over the Neer-pow-
ered grad-group. His moves and
shooting touch evidenced mid-
season form.

Four guards are expected to
spend almost equal time on the
court this season. Senior Jerry
Porath and sophomore Paul Ma-
loney are to control the offensive
tempo, fulfilling the particularly
demanding role of floor general.
Bowman Williams, a junior with
a rare outside shooting touch,
and John Podgajny, a sophomore,
should provide effective counter-
parts to the playmakers.

Inevitably, pressure defense
produces fouls, but in a single
half against George Mason, W&L
committed 20. The excessive num-
ber reveals the inconsistency of

Basketball season opens Friday;

play that renders this team a
question-mark, especially in the
early going of this year’s sche-
dule. Mental lapses, which result
in fouls or turnovers, are the leg-
acy of inexperience,

The team has practiced six
kinds of defense, but plans to use
the press predominantly. There
is the chance that a Canfield
favorite, the match-up defense,
could be employed, particularly
against teams that do not shoot
well from the outside. Its effec:
tiveness rests on quickness and
communication.

In talking with Jerry Porath
about the season’s prospects, a
marked sense of change from the
past colored his thoughts. He can-
didly admitted that last year’s
mediocre showing “left a bad
taste in everyone’s mouths, es-
pecially the seniors,” and seems
determined to make this, his final
season, a time of which to be
proud. He calls the present squad
“the best conditioned I’ve seen
since I’ve been here.”

Preparation has included work-

outs last spring, strenuous prac-
tice and conditioning sessions be-
ginning this September. Most im-

portantly, “this team wants to
play . it’s a year of enthu-
siasm.” For coach and players
alike, the 1973-74 season is one of
re-dedication, of optimism. In this
sense, youth serves its loftiest
function. The team believes it can
win. However, even as Porath
cautioned, “game time is essen-
tial.”

The initial rush of games pro-
mises to sternly test all hopes, be-
ginning with tomorrow night’s
home contest against obscure, but
challenging Clinch Valley, an 8
p.m. affair. This tiny western Vir-
ginia college knocked off Emory
and Henry last week, without the
services of its leading scorer from
a year ago. The game counts in
the VCAA standings, and thus is
an important one for W&L’s play:
off aspirations.

Saturday night, U.Va’s ACC
delegation makes a visit, com-
plete with big-time names and
awesome talents. Of note, Wally
Walker may not play due to re-
cent knee surgery. Monday, the
Generals trek to Lynchburg, then
return to Doremus for a meeting
with Baltimore College on Wed-
nesday night.

Soccer team loses season finale to Navy

By BILL AUSTIN

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s soccer team finished its
1973 fall season with a 3-1 loss to
the Naval Academy. The defeat
dropped the Generals’ overall
won-lost mark to 7-4, with three
of the losses coming in the final
four games.

W&L opened the chilly, pre-
holiday Saturday contest with a
quick lead, gained on Jim Fox’s
penalty kick. To be sure, the team
matched Navy for toughness and
skill in the initial moments. Its
efforts were fueled by the noise
of the boisterous, fair-sized crowd
on hand at Wilson Field, and by
the persistent tunes of a novice
Pep band.

However, the strength of Navy’s
halfbacks doomed upset hopes.
W&L’s offensive thrusts were
few, as the visitors parlayed
sharp passes and physical play
into a domination of shots (tak-
ing 15 to W&L’s three in the first
half), and ultimately, of score.

The 2-1 half-time Navy lead
came on a pair of goals by Knie-

riem despite Paul Devine’s out-
standing individual efforts as
goalie.

Navy’s domination was made
still more emphatic in the final
stanza when most of the play was
confined to the Generals’ portion
of the field. Tom Panick’s unas-
sisted boot past the outstretched
arms of Devine gave the Middies
a 3-1 margin and a lock on vic-
tory.

Washington and Lee’s fullbacks,
hard pressed by Navy’s classy
offensive penetrations, turned in
a stubborn, praiseworthy per-
formance. In particular, Rolf
Piranian shook off a second-half
injury and fatigue to close out his
collegiate soccer career in a typi-
cally effective fashion. His gradu-
ation will rob the squad of a sign-
ificant portion of its hustle, its
heart.

For the game, Navy boasted a
total of 24 shots, while its two
goalies were pressed to make only
six saves. In sobering contrast,
Wé&L managed just eight shots,
while Devine picked up 20 saves
in a very busy afternoon’s work.
