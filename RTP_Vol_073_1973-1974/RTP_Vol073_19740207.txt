An editorial

We are caught in the proverbial horns of a dilemma.

Today, Friday and Monday, students are voting on a referendum
to the student body consitution which would allow the Executive
Committee to call a closed session only for discussion of possible
honor violations.

Lo and behold, three weeks after the date of the referendum
and the referendum itself had been established, the EC Monday
night all of a sudden discovered a “flaw” in the referendum and has
launched an all-out campaign to prevent the referendum from being
affirmed,

The EC (see Lewis Powell’s letter below) wants to be able to
call closed sessions not only for honor violations, as is outlined by
the proposed amendent, but also for appointment of committees, a
process which the EC contends needs the utmost of privacy.

To pinpoint the dilemma, we must admit we see both sides of
the argument. On the EC’s side, we see where an applicant for a
committee would not want his application face the possibility of
scrutiny on the part of the entire student body. And we can see
where the process of deliberation over chosing an applicant has the
potential of becoming highly personal,

We must, however, note the other side of the issue. (See J. P.
Woodley’s letter, page 2). Consider, for example, the chairman of
the Student Activities Board. He directly presides over more than
510,000 of the student body’s funds. And other committee members
handle other matters relating to the campus as a whole.

Proponents of the proposed amendment feel open selection of
committee members would ensure that the best man be chosen.
Cognate with this is the feeling that open selection of committees
would prevent the EC from picking its buddies as chairmen and
committee members. This charge is leveled almost annually at the
EC, and, since we don’t know how the selection is made, the charge
is not necessarily without reason,

Thus, we are inclined to hedge a bit when trying to pick the side
in the best interests of the student body. If we listen to the EC, then
committee members should be picked confidentially to assure that
the best man for the job be chosen. And the proponents of the pro-
posed amendment, the adversaries of the EC, say just the opposite.

We must agree with the proposed amendment as it now stands,
and to vote for its passage. We feel this would benefit the student
most of this issue. But the decision is not ours to make, much to the
EC’s delight; and neither is it the EC’s decision, much to our delight.

The decision is yours, much, we hope, to your own delight. Vote.

The EC’s side

A Student Body referendum on
a. proposed constitutional amend-
ment began this morning and is
scheduled to run for three days.
This amendment, if passed, would
prohibit the Executive Committee
from holding closed sessions on
any matter other than possible
honor violation nivestigations. Al-
though the idea is basically sound,
this proposal has a very serious
fiaw.

Each year the EC must appoint
interested and capable students to
11 student and student-faculty
committees. The process of selec-
tion involves interviewing each
applicant, generally about 75 stu-
dents.

In order to ensure that quali-
fied people are chosen, each appli-
cant is carefully screened. This
necessarily involves the discus-
sion of such matters as his grades
and his ability to get along and
work well with others. In short,
the EC must talk to each appli-

eant, and then consider his fit-

a_ particular
committee. These interviews, and
the subsequent evaluations there-
of, have always been of a highly
personal nature, and have there-
fore been held in executive ses-
sion.

Should the proposed amend-
ment pass, this selection process
would in the future be held in
open session, As a_ prospective
applicant, would you want the
EC’s discussions of your qualifi-
cations to be open to the public?

Such lack of confidentiality
would, I submit, have two unde-
sirable effects. It would restrict
a free exchange between the EC
and the applicant. And, more im-
portantly, it might well discour-
age many capable students from
applving,

The passage of this amendment
would jeopardize what has proven
to be an effective committee ap-
pointment process. This amend-
ment is, in a word, ill-conceived.

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, FEBRUARY 7, 1974

By PAUL MORELLA

The University Council defeat-
ed a motion last Thursday to
reschedule the winter vacation
following many student com-
plaints that, because of the fuel
shortage, returning on Sunday,
Feb. 17, would be extremely dif-
ficult, particularly for students
who are planning to drive.

As originally planned, the
winter vacation will commence at
2:05 p.m. on Wednesday, Feb. 13
and extend through the following
Sunday.

The UC, nonetheless, did pass
a motion that the faculty be
alerted that due to certain travel
difficulties, many students would
possibly be absent on Monday,
Feb. 18. There is no way, how-

Fancy dress changes its theme

So you have always wanted to
go to Mardi Gras?

The gas shortage being as it
is, Fancy Dress 1974 is bringing
New Orleans and its world-re-
nowned celebration to Washing-
ton and Lee.

On Friday, February 22, the
Washington and Lee Student Cen-
ter will become the city of New
Orleans and Main Street, Lexing-
ton, will become Bourbon Street,

The festivities will get under-
way at 2 p.m. with a parade
through the streets of Lexington.

At 9:30 p.m., the doors of the
Student Center will swing open
and it will be festival time at
Washington and Lee.

As unto the “olden days,” dress
will be semi-formal or approri-
ate Mardi Gras costume.

Invitations may be purchased
for $7 per couple and will be
available in the Co-op and Stu-
dent Center beginning early next
week.

The theme was changed from
“Land of 0z” to “Mardi Gras” last
week by the IFC,

Representing the students

The University Council, as campus propaganda puts it, “is design-
ed to give the students increased involvement in the University
governmental process” (Student Handbook, 1973-74, page 11).

It is not fulfilling this role, except, perhaps, in a nominal way.

The UC consists of the university president, the student body
president, four deans, and, in a nicely balanced arrangement, 12
faculty members and 12 students.

When the faculty created the UC in 1970, it had in mind that
the balance between students and faculty members would promote
the freest and most uninhibited exchange of ideas in the council.
The UC was to serve as a sounding board for student ideas.

Such has not been the case, at least when it comes down to taking
a vote on various issues.

Consider the following:

—A motion was introduced last term calling for open faculty
meetings. The move was designed to give students an idea of what
goes on behind some of the executive decisions made in the ad-
ministrative bureaucracy of Washington and Lee, no matter how
boring the decision-making process might be. The move was certainly
in the best interests of the students. Yet only three students voted
for the motion under the seemingly glaring eyes of faculty and
administration who opposed the opening of faculty meetings. The
student members, in the best interest of the student body, should have
voted for the motion.

In place of that strong resolution, the UC voted for a trade-
off in which the faculty would release what it thought was
pertinent to the discussion of the faculty meetings. That proposal
is currently under consideration by the faculty.

 

—Also last term, a motion was brought to the UC asking that
the faculty allow increased student participation in the Courses and
Degrees Committee, increasing student membership from one to six
students. The six students would have balanced out an equal number
of caulty and administrative personnel, and the C&D Committee and
the Student Curriculum Committee) that is supposed to be.

The proposal was watered down, with outside help, in the UC
to an eight faculty-four student solution. The proposal was defeated
by the faculty.

—Last Thursday, the UC voted against changing the dates of the
winter term break, scheduled for next Thursday through Sunday.
Students who live more than a tankful of gas away from W&L will
probably not be able to go home, because it would be worthless to
come back on a Saturday and almost impossible to come back on a
Sunday, due to the voluntary shutdown of gas stations on that day.

But, under what some UC students apparently felt was the menac-
ing suggestion by Dean Watt that the break remain unchanged, those
students overwhelmingly voted to go along with the administration’s
point of view, despite the fact that more than a tankful of students
will now stay here next weekend because they simply can’t go home.

A syndrome has developed among the UC student representa-
tives. It’s known as the “boy, I sure don’t want the faculty and
administration against me just because of some stupid proposal”
syndrome. Most, but certainly not all, of the UC students seem
to be placing their stature in the eyes of the faculty and administra-
tion ahead of the job to which they were elected—the job of repre-
senting the students.

About three-fourths of the student representatives are worrying
that the deans and professors are going to look at the way they
voted on a particular issue and automatically condemn that student
to death (or worse yet, to a “D”) if the opportunity arises. This is,
to quote a high-ranking White House official, ‘“poppycock.”

Certainly the administrative and faculty members of the UC
cast a menacing eye when they express their views on a particular
proposal, as certainly any member of a legislative body, particularly
one with high ranking, casts a menacing eye when he has something
to say about a proposal before that body.

But student representatives of the UC are apparently having a
hard time realizing that the menacing stare broadcast by a faculty
member or dean only affects what goes on within the confines of
the University Council. It certainly does not—indeed, it cannot in this
day and age—extend beyond the confines of council business.

And, certainly, faculty and administration are entitled to their
menacing stares, just as any legislator is entitled to voice his opinion
as adamantly as he may wish. But to interpret a professor’s look dur-
ing a debate as a warning that you'd better not come to class to-
morrow is sheer, again, poppycock.

And, it seems that the wishy-washy nature of most student UC
members has made the faculty sit back and wonder about a student
proposal, particularly if a majority of the students of the UC fail
to vote for the proposal. How can the faculty seriously entertain a
student motion if the student closest to the faculty—those on the
UC. are afraid to represent the students?

It’s time the majority of the University Council student representa-
tives stop looking out for themselves when they don’t have to and
start following that minority of UC student representatives who have
been seeking to represent the student body as best they know how,

Fear on the University Council

TTERS TE

On the referendum

SH

Today, tomorrow, and Monday
the student body will vote on a
constitutional amendment pro-
hibiting closed EC meetings ex-
cept in cases of possible Honor
violations. The issue had the
initial and vocal support of EC
President Doug Schwartz and
Secretary Ben Sherman, and that
of many other members of the
Committee.

Now, Doug and Ben have de-
cided to reverse their positions
on this issue and oppose the
passage of this amendment. They
now feel that the Executive Com-
mittee should have the ability to
meet in secret to consider ap-
pointments to various Student
Body Committees.

It is precisely this kind of
secrecy that the proposed amend-
ment sought to prohibit. The stu-
dent body has every right to
know what criteria are used for
these appointments, and what
justification is presented by their
elected representatives for these
choices.

I hardly need point out that
the bodies that the EC appoints
have tremendous potential im-
pact on the lives of W&L stu-
dents.

The Cold Check Committee has
enormous quasi-judicial powers.
So does the faculty-student Stu-
dent Affairs Committee. The

funds. These men, once appoint:
ed, serve totally without review
from anyone outside the Execu-
tive Committee.

The EC now appoints these
people in camera, with no stu-
dent body review of their de-
cisions.

These men could be guilty of
the grossest dereliction of duty,
and perform grave injustices on
students, but, in the interests of
confidentiality, the reports of
these injustices would never be
made public. Some check, how-
ever informal, on these appoint-
ments would be provided by in-
suring that the EC held its
deliberation in public.

Also, open meetings would al-
low additional student input on
these vital decisions. I am not a
superstitious man, and I do not
think election to the Executive
Committee confers upon any indi-
vidual a superhuman supply of
wisdom. Only adherence to some
such superstition could justify
closed EC meetings for making
appointments.

In my three and one-half years
at W&L, the EC has slowly de-
cended from its once-Olympian
heights to become more and more
open and less and less aloof from
student input and critcism. The
proposed amendment is another
step away from an Olympian EC
toward a modern representative
student government.

Very truly yours,

Inside-Out

By ROME SCOTT

   

You know, when a columnist is stumped on what to write he
often leans back to think about the things he’s written in the past.

This is one of those times and with the stereo turned way up,
Allman Brothers’ music seething in one ear, out the other and in
again, it’s natural that one of their past concerts should come up.
In this case, though, two of the group’s concerts come to mind.

One winter in Lexington, not so long ago, there was a concert in
the old gym. Cowboy, a virtually unknown country-rock band, and
the Allman Brothers complete with Duane Allman and Berry Oakley,
both now dead, put on that show.

If the show had been reviewed, Cowboy would have gotten the
raves while the Brothers: would have been left wanting.

With this in mind, as well as the conflict between those who
believe the old Alimen Brothers better than the new, here is a
review of a recent Brothers concert:

For many of those there, the Allman Brothers’ concert did not
end with the final note of the music.

And it will go on in both thought and feeling for many reasons.

Drive, the basic element in any contemporary music group’s ability
to captivate an audience, is abundant in the new Allman Brothers
Band.

Both, as individuals and as a unit, the band punches its sound out
with an impact that is, simultaneously, jackhammer hard and soul
soft.

The melody lines are hauntingly heavy and stick with the listener
long after the songs are finished but, even as they are haunting, the
lines are biting and touch the innermost depths of one’s feeling.

The complexity of the group’s music’s effect originates in the
members’ ability to use each instrument’s sound individually to
create an intricate, melodic, yet rhythmic whole.

Guitar phrases by Dickie Betts are complimented harmonically,
primarily, by upper thirds from Greg Allman on the organ and piano
player Chuck Nevile adds depth and body to the intent projected by
the guitar and organ.

Lemar Williams, replacing Berry Oakley on bass, contributes a
gutsy touch through clear, deep tone and dynamic style.

And the two drummers give a solid percussive but simple basis
for the combined sound of the other instruments.

Firmly founded in old time T-Bone and Lightnin’ Hopkins blues,
the Allman Brothers’ music is “boogie blues,” a mixture of funk and
feeling that makes it impossible for the listener to sit still.

Lacking nothing essential for the loss of an almost legendary
Duane Allman, the Allman Brothers Band has proven that a group’s
music is not necessarily determined by one member.

At the top of musical stardom with Duane Allman, the group has
lost none of its shine without him.

That’s the opinion of one reviewer as are all critiques but those
who disagree still dance when the Allman Brothers begin.

‘Oregon’ music group

By W. PATRICK HINELY

Music is better played than
talked about, but it is said that
good musicians can do both. Of
course, many of the best music-
ians have said that good music
speaks for itself and needs no
words. These and other topics
may be up for discussion, verb-
ally and musically, when the four
musicians collectively Known as
Oregon visit the W&L campus for
Contact ’74.

They will present a concert in
Lee Chapel, at 8:30 p.m. on
Wednesday, March 6. An impro-
visational workshop will be held
in Fairfax Lounge on Thursday,
March 7, from 2 to 5 p.m.

The members of Oregon gen-
erally try to avoid classification
of their style(s) of music, for the
reason that putting verbal labels
on music is, in itself, a false
limitation upon a true art. Per-
haps the most meaningful gen-
eral description of their body of
work would be chamber ensemble
jazz.

Critics have cited Oregon’s
music as the type of work from
the 1970’s which will endure to
become “classical” in the coming
centuries. The group has two
albums, on the Vanguard label,
“Music of Another Present Era,”
recorded in 1972, and “Distant
Hills,” recorded last summer and

scheduled for release this month.
They can also be heard as part
of the Winter Consort on “Road,”
an A&M album, which was theit
first musical experience as a
group.

The four musicians who com-
prise Oregon are Paul McCand.-
less, on oboe and English horn,
Glenn Moore, on basses, fiute,
piano, and violin, Ralph Tower,
on guitars, piano, mellophone and
trumpet, and Collin Walcott, who
plays sitar, tabla, clarinet, violin,
and assorted percussion.

McCandless was an oboe major
at Duquesne University and the
Manhattan School of Music,
studying under Robret Bloom and
Bernard Goldberg. He has played
with the New Haven, Pittsburgh,
and Springfield Symphony Orch-
estras, and was a finalist in the
New York Philharmonic’s Eng-
lish horn auditions in 1971. While
a member of the Winter Consort,
he appeared at Tanglewood,
Chautauqua, the Schaeffer Festi-
val, and Fillmores East and West.

Glenn Moore majored in His-
torv at the University of Oregon.
He studied bass with Edgar
Gomez and Ron Carter, among
others. He has studied piano with
Bill Evans, Jan Hammer, Paul
Bley, and Denny Zeitlin, and
studied flute with Jeremy Stieg.

blocked by too many obstacles at the planning stage. For one
thing, no one on the Student Activities Board could think of
what the Emerald City looked like, although one member insisted

he had worked there last summer as a busboy and that the
general style of architecture was “predominately tossed with a
tasteful layer of Thousand Island.”

Secondly, the call for the EC members to play the parts of
Munchkins in the projected parade through town generated no
little complaint within the Council itself. (“Somebody’s gotta
do it,’ said Mike Brittin, SAB chairman, when Doug Schwartz,
the student body president, remarked that, at Cornell, they all
got to dress as tin-men or wizards at their Oz prom.)

The third problem encountered with the Oz theme was the
Bldg. & Grounds’ refusal to plant a small poppy field outside
Evans Dining Hall for the Queen of the Parade to sleep in.
(‘Just like Dorothy and Toto did in the movie,’ Brittin ex-
claimed to the EC).

The final decision to “drop a house” on the idea came when
Mrs. Grundy’s second grade class at the local elementary school
announced that it was planning a parents’ tea around the same
theme. (Complained Schwartz to Phi reporters: “The little buggers
stole our show!”).

So, my advice to you is to throw out your fifty-dollar suit

Hillside Terrace being replaced

W&L’s married student housing

Editor's note— This is the
second in a series of articles
exploring housing at Washing-
ton and Lee. This week, a look
at married student housing.

By TOM RITTENBURG

Have vou ever wondered why
the married students at Washing-
ton and Lee live in housing that
looks like Traveller’s stable or a
scene from Sergeant York? The
reference, of course, is to the Hill-
side Terrace units southwest of
the university on Woods Creek.

Some of the apartments, if that
term can be properly used, are
now being torn down in that
complex. Yet, 27 married students
and their families still live there.

The Hillside and Davidson Park
behemoths are army-style hous-
ing units first built in 1945 to
handle the influx of veterans en-
tering college after World War
lI. The housing was supposed to
be temporary. But a lack of funds
and a lack of need to retire the
units has kept their status as
temporary for more than a gen-
eration.

Frank Parsons, assistant to the
president at W&L, says the apart-
ments, contrary to their outward
appearance, are actually quite
comfortable inside. He says each
student and family modifies the
interior to satisfy individual
taste, and there are generally few
complaints, particularly at $50 a
month in Hillside.

Parsons says the university is
now tearing down some of the
apartments as the demand lessens.

Two units of three apartments
each are being taken down cur-
rently. One was used last term
only for storage; the other re-
mained unused.

Once the unts are torn down,
the land over which they were
can be returned to the city. The
city owns all Hillside Terrace and
Davidson Park land. Plans are
tentative for a park to replace
the apartments. Hillside is ex-
pected to be torn down long be-
fore Davidson Park.

The university was to replace
the Hillside housing in 1971, but
formal plans fell through. First
bids for 30 units of new married
student housing near Liberty Hall
were accepted, but W&L decided
to investigate the possibilities of
a Housing and Urban Develop-
ment Department grant before
proceeding with construction.

HUD’s red tape and inflation
multiplied costs and designs for
construction. Upon asking for a
second set of bids, the university
received but one—some 49 per
cent higher than what W&L felt
it could afford.

In the meantime, a local con-
struction firm received a HUD
grant to build a 100-unit family
style apartment complex north of
Lexington. Work has begun on
the units just off Rt. 39 by the
Moose Fairgrounds. Some of the
units are expected to be finished
by next fall.

Rent will be competitive with
that of local housing, according to
Parsons. The university will
recommend the new complex to
married students and hopes this
way to eliminate need for Hill-
side, so the complex can be de-
molished.

Rent, rent subsidy, and housing
design information will be avail-

Mohler in Washington Hall in a

The university will continue to

use the facilities of Davidson Park
as it says those units are still
in good shape, while Hillside is
gradually retired.

Legal Aid Society

Editor’s note: This is the sec-
ond in a series of articles ex-
ploring community — services
both by and for students at
Washington and Lee.

By DARRYL CARLTON

The Legal Aid Society was
started in 1966, according to its
adviser, Dr. Lawrence Gaughan,
to satisfy the regulations of
the American Bar Association
through the Virginia Supreme
Court.

In Lexington, it was initiated
by the Rockbridge/Buena Vista
Bar Association. Each client must
have a practicing lawyer to de-
fend him in court, but law school
students do most of the work
on each case, according to Dr.
Gaughan.

The Legal Aid Association
works with indigents or people
who can’t afford to hire lawyel's
in the community. Cases fought
through this society range from
divorce and other family law
problems to entitlement to gov-
ernment benefits through welfare
and other agencies.

Dr. Gaughan commented that
the Legal Aid Association is en-
tirely volunteer to the law stu-
dents and, in fact, charges a
five-dollar fee to insure commit-
ment to the program. He also
said that he has hopes that a
bill will soon be passed by the

Reach-Out and the Legal Aid

community. The Legal Aid So-
ciety is staffed by law students
working with lawyers, but it does
not, in general, provide help to

so on the community, but it

The fuel crisis and the winter break

An analysis

By JOHN MULLIKEN
Washington’s holiday begins
next Wednesday as_ originally
scheduled and most of the stu-
dent body will be heading out
of Lexington dispite the UC and
the energy crisis. The UC re-

fused to change the dates of the
break, so classes will begin on
Monday, Feb. 18. But don’t worry
about driving back on Sunday,
the UC passed a resolution to
inform the faculty not to be sur-
prised if nobody comes back until

Tuesday.
There are other side effects
than no gas on Sunday with

which the student traveler must
cope—the price and availability
of gas, illegal price gouging, and
59 mph speed limits.

Currently the price of gas seems
to be running between 50 and 60
cents per gallon. Locally, the
average price is 49.5 for regular
and 53.4 for high test. Prices will
tend to be higher near urban

blacks, which climaxed with the
famous “I Have A Dream” speech
at the Lincoln Memorial in 1963.

W&L nips Bridgewater in overtime,
demolishes Bowie State team, 111-65

By BILL AUSTIN
SCORES:

W&L 84 Bridgewater 83 (ot)
W&L 111 Bowie State 65

Following their well-played loss
t Randolph-Macon, Washington
and Lee’s’ basketball Generals
nade the rest of this past week
a profitable one.

In Wednesday’s game against
Bridgewater, W&L gained a mea-
sure of revenge for an earlier loss
tao the same squad, and managed
to overcome the season-long jinx
which had dogged such tight con-
tests.

Then, in another home game
this past Saturday night, the Gen-
erals shredded Bowie State’s zone
press and illusions of victory to
the tune of a 111-65 walloping.
The wins hiked the team’s over-
all record to 7-10, and fueled
speculation concerning a .500 sea-
son’s finish.

The Bridgewater game follow-
ed the pattern established in sev-
eral previous contests, where
W&L mounted a sizeable advant-
age only to watch it disappear in
the late going. True to form, the
Generals grabbed a 39-33 half-
time lead behind the sharp-shoot-
ing of guard John Podgajny. His
10 points topped General scoring
tallies in the opening stanza,
while Skip Lichtfuss added eight.

Predictably, the Eagle staged a
determined come-back bid in the
final 20 minutes of play. Down
bv eight at 47-39, Bridgewater
found its fire-power in two senior
forwards, Sam McCoy and Tom
Payne. The Eagles took the lead
on a Payne jumper with 4:45

remaining, and moved the margin
to three points, at 72-69, on a
McCoy follow-up. Skip Lichtfuss
personally answered the chal-
lenge by tallving four points in
the final minute and a_ half,
bringing the Generals back to a
74-74 tie at the lose of regula-
tion play. 3

In overtime, the lead see-sawed
hectically until, with but nine
seconds left, Podgajny sank both
ends of a one-and-one situation.
His pressure-packed free throws
gave W&L an 84-81 advantage and
the game. The clutch tosses also
fattened his personal point-total
to 20. Lichtfuss topped team
effforts with 30. In a losing cause
McCoy scored 22 and Payne 20.

Saturday night’s game contain-
ed none of Wednesday's tensions,
as the Generals never trailed.
Rather, this was the night for
fluid fast breaks, incredible shots
and soaring shooting percentages.

Led by junior Guy Kerr, who
chose an impressive way to cele-
brate his birthday, W&L made
shambles of Bowie State’s pre-
tenses to a full court press.

Kerr poured in 18 first-period
points, but his offensive excel-
lence was not a unique occurrence
on this particular evening. Team-
mate Greg Croghan and Skip
Lichtfuss joined in the first-half
celebration, tossing in 14 and 10
points, respectively. Actually, no
one missed very often; the team
shot a blistering 62% for 20
special minutes,

In addition, guards Podgajny,
Williams, Porath, and Maloney

Apparently impressed, the sopho-

Sir?

Observing events here at Wash-
ington and Lee over the past few
months, I have seen some positive
efforts to improve the Fine Arts
Department. At the Alumni Con-
ference, the Alumni of many dif-
ferent regions and ages talked of
beginning an effort for a Fine
Arts facility. Since then, Al Gor-
don has been hired to fill the
position of head of the Fine Arts
Department. This points to the
fact that the administration is
concerned.

In the meantime there is some-

‘an be done. The Sculpture Studio
is overcrowded with equipment
that is needed, but leaves very
little space for the students to
Work in.

While the studio is overcrowd:
ed a whole room is occupied by
a piece of equipment owned by
the Chemistry Department, but
which has not been used for the
last two vears, at least. This room
is needed desperately for equip-
ment that is already ordered.

With a minimum of effort, a
large improvement could be ae-
complished,
