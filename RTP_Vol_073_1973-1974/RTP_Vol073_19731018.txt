onstitutional vote ends today;
part of main proposition attacked

By ROBERT PUGH

The EC Monday night attacked
the “secret hatchetmen,” those
persons being the anonymous
authors of a statement condemn-
ing the revised, updated consti-
tution.

Law school rep. Tom King, who
drafted most of the proposed
constitution, said “we tried to
make these (decisions about
changes) as open as possible.” He
added that the amendments were
drafted during three open EC
meetings. Additionally, a public
hearing was held and publicized.
Only one student showed up.

No one ever complained about
the procedure for constitutional
amendments, which makes it eas-
ier to make changes. Presently
half the student body must vote

for a change, and it is almost
impossible to get that many
people to cast ballots, the EC
said. The new provision would

require a two-thirds major of
those who vote in an election in
which at least half the students
participate.

Both junior reps expressed dis-
may-at the unsigned statement.
Ben Bailey suggested that stu-
dents with questions about the
constitution ask EC members for
an explanation. Bob Keatley chal-
lenged the “hatchetmen’s” accur-
acy by pointing out that the new
constitution created many more
elective positions than it abolish-
ed,

louTLOOK and REVIEW

A matter of logic

Today is, in case you haven't noticed, the last day to vote on
the proposed student body constitution drawn up by the Executive
Committee.

In order for the proposed document to be approved, half of the
student body (approximately 802 students according to the EC)
must vote in favor of it. This leads to a problem. That this problem
exists is exemplified by the fact that the EC has stretched the voting
period on the constitution to four days, from Monday until today, in
order to get as many students voting on the proposal as possible.

The problem is that there probably aren’t enough students who
really care enough one way or the other about the constitution to
yote on it, which leads us to a dilemma whose logic may be a bit
difficult to follow.

One part of the proposed constitution calls for a revamping of
the voting procedure on constitutional issues. This would require,
instead of majority approval of the whole student body, a two-thirds
majority approval of those voting if at least half vote. This could
feasibly mean that one-third of the student body could decide the
issues.

Now, for those who think that this is not democracy, the proposal
could be defeated in one of two ways—it could be voted down by a
majority of the student body (and it is doubtful that 802 students
would come out and vote against the constitution) or 801 or less stu-
dents would vote for the measure, in which case a majority is not
obtained.

Now let us consider the more likely of the two possibilities: not
enough votes to approve the constitution are mustered, and the specific
clause with the rest of the constitution fails. This is certainly a round-
about way of defeating the measure, and it soundly illustrates the
reason why the proposal was raised in the first place. The proposal
would prevent motions from failing just because not enough persons
were interested in voting. Which leads us to our dilemma.

If not enough students vote, the need of the proposal will be
illustrated; thus the proposal (which, in case you've forgotten by
this time, would allow two-thirds of students voting, if a majority
of the whole student body votes, to decide an issue) should be
approved. But it won’t be because not enough students voted.

If a majority of the student body approves the constitution along
with the proposal in question, then it could be doubted that such a
proposal is needed, since a majority is mustered.

About the only logical course of action would be defeat of the
proposal (and, unfortunately, the rest of the constitution with it) by
a majority of the students, at least 802 of hem.

It is unfortunate that the proposal was 1) set up the way it was
and 2) included along with the general body of the constitution. But
al] is done and there remains only one task to be accomplished.

Get out and vote. —P.J.L.

Entertainment returns to W&L

Tonight represents one of the first fruits of the labors of a newly-
formed group which has been wrongly called everything from the
Students Affairs Board to the Student Affairs Committee to, heaven
forbid, the Dance Board, but which has been working constantly since
last May as the Student Activities Board.

Scruggs is not the first SAB production; the board has presented
“Who Killed JFK?” in co-sponsorship with Contact, Jerome Mac-
Murray, a Wednesday Forum on town and gown relations, and a
much-improved roster of films. And, Friday night, SAB brings the
Impressions to W&L for a homecoming dance.

Looking to the future, two projects of the SAB already stand out:
the signing of a promoter to bring in name groups to the school, and
the signing of the National Shakespeare Company to perform “As
You Like It” in January in, good heavens, Doremus Gym.

Thus far, the creation of the SAB last May to unite and coordinate
all student activities has produced a marked improvement in the
rather activity-less environment of this university. SAB could be the
turning point at W&L—turning the mass exodus of trips down the
road, leaving the college void of activity, to an exodus toward W&L
to partake in an ever-increasing list of activities on this campus.

But, SAB is still young, and is still in danger of making some
wrong moves. Before the board lashes out at new areas of entertain-
ment and cultural activities, it should, before year’s end, formulate
a constitution or at least some written doctrine oulining procedure,
precedence, and the like pertaining to the board.

And so, as SAB moves ahead in its formative months at W&L,
we hope it moves not only toward a goal of reincarnating fun here,
but also toward a goal of stabilizing its own existence. —P.J.L.

Joy at the

By ROBERT HIBURN,

The group is, quite simply,
the most assured com-
bination of traditional and

ideas that I’ve seen on the
Troubadour stage, a group
with far more range, authen-
ticity and joy in its music than
any of the many second-genera-
tion bands that proudly march
under the country-rock label.
The Earl Scruggs Revue isn’t
just another band, it is a tight-
ly disciplined, valuable cross
between some of the best of the
past and the present in country-
oriented music.

“The Student Activities Board
exists and appeals as an um-
brella organization. That is, a
group not steeped in power, but
rather in cooperation, compati-
oility, availability and assistance.
We are not and do not pretend
to be a group out to promote our
own interests. Rather, our chief
concern is others and it is that
essential philosophy that we hope
will pervade our visibility.”

So stated senior Mike Brittin,
chairman of the newly formed
Student Activities Board, in a re-
cent report to the Executive Com-
mittee on the goals and purposes
of SAB.

Accoring to Brittin, SAB is aim-
ing towards creating a sense of
community and an atmosphere
that encourages involvement
through the attainment of the
following two goals: SAB must
appear, visibly and earnestly, to
the student body as a “center for
the dissemination of ideas as well
as a task force dedicated to the
implication of those ideas,” and
SAB endeavors to “coordinate the
various campus activities, thereby
reducing the imbalance of sched-
uling and the problem of duplica-
tion of function.

“Thus, we stress variety,” Brit-

SAB

tin explained, “and mean to fol-

low up on nearly every sugg-
gestion — every one which is

plausible, physically and financi-
ally, and which seems to hold an
interest for a reasonable number
of students.”

Brittin went on to expound up-
on the decision making process of
the SAB as well as the control
of finances by each separate sub-
committee. A budget for each
sub-committee was set up _ last
vear and work now proceeds with
that financial regard. ‘Flexibility
is the key here,” Brittin stated,
“The SAB views the sharing of
funds to promote one large in-
terest as most plausible.”

For the 1973-74 school year, the
SAB has a number of activities
planned or being planned, as well
as many already accomplished.
Those already accomplished in-
clude: two art shows, Jerome Mac-
Murray, “Who Killed JFK?” spec-

Film committee presents Ford flicks

By C. B. PETTY

The recent death of master
movie-maker John Ford leaves a
gap in the ranks of American
directors, a gap amply illustrated
by the John Ford Retrospective
film series which is now being
shown. Five of Ford’s more well-
known films are being presented
by the W&L film committee in a
festival designed to acquaint
film-goers with Ford’s achieve-
ments. Admission to all screenings
is free,

Ford is perhaps best noted as
the film director who turned the
so-called “horse opera” into an
art form and who made John

Transcendental meditation
group meets on Monday

By GORDON GROVES

For 15 minutes of pure and
easy practice twice daily, I am
unfolding my full potential. Full
potential of mind. Full blooming
heart. And my Hfe keeps ex-
panding in love, and joy, and in-
telligence, always increasing in
terms of my own needs and as-
pirations.

Transcendental Meditation is
the supersmooth scientific techni-
que whereby the totality of life’s
rhythms and meanings are un-
covered, discovered.

TM is not hypnosis.

It is the spiritual asset needed
to re-open our previously closed
accounts with reality.

It is not ESP.

It is the simple and quick, psy-
chological method whereby the
perfect mental harmony is realiz-
ed.

It’s not a systematic intellect-
ual exercise. On the contrary, it
is so easy and effortless and re-
quires no concentration.

It is the most frugal and temp-
crate means of meditation where-
by the greatest spiritual and ma-
terial profits are realized.

TM is not a religion, or a life-
stvle, or a weirdism.

Transcendental Meditation,
practiced for a few minutes
morning and evening as one sits
with eves closed, relieves all the
stress, the strains, worries and
tensions of living in the material
world.

Some say it’s a song.

Across The Universe
Words are flowing out like
endless rain into a paper cup.
They slither while they pass, they
slip away across the Universe.

Construction to begin immediately

New student housing approved

By JESS REEVES

Work will begin this week on
preparation of the site for on-
campus apartments to accom-
modate 178 students. The project
is expected to be completed and
ready for occupancy by next
september.

The complex will be located in
Woods Creek Valley between the
new Lewis Hall and the front
campus. The project will have
three buildings, two with 17 units
and one containing six units.

At present only 112 upperclass-
men and law students can be
accommodated in housing offered
ov the university. Nearly 1,000
students are forced to find living
quarters in Lexington or the
county. An administration survey
last year showed that in many
cases the housing rented to stu-
dents was substandard and _ stu-
lents wanted the university to
provide them an alternative.

The project has been designed
by Marcellus, Wright, Cox &
Cilimberg, the architects for the
concrete, glass and brick monster
Lewis Hall. The design calls for
a textured finish of rough weath-
ered wood to blend in, supposedly,
with the rustic, wooded site in
the valley.

Whether or not one finds the
design for the apartments at-
tractive the new project will fill
the student need for housing.

Sports Editor

Baseball’s magic is back. Ab-
solutely. Redskin lovers, Cowboy
die-hards, divert your bleary eyes
to the autumn spectacle that is
baseball’s way of determining a
World Champion.

In these final games, where a
ground ball sets off a crisis, and
a walk constitutes high drama,
the purest beauty of the sport
emerges. A single pitch can alter
an outcome, a mental error can
unravel an entire team’s unity.
There is, honestly, nothing that
quite matches this culmination of
summer-tediousness, this heroic
striving by baseball’s best teams
for alluring fame and _ riches,
championship fruits.

From the start of this year’s
play-offs, the unusual has _ be-
come the expected. After all, the
amazing Mets were one of the
four participating squads, and
their September antics had re-
vived memories of the 1969 sea-
son and its unbelievable glories.
Determined to crush this foolish-

ness were the Cincinnati Reds, a
club which finally seemed equip-
ped with a fair share of pitch-
ing to complement its potent at-
tack: Pete Rose, Tony Perez,
Johnny Bench, Joe Morgan.
Evidently, the Met pitching
staff was unimpressed. The quar-
tet of Seaver, Matlack, Koosman
and Stone, so instrumental in the
September surge that produced a
19-8 won-lost record for the
month and division laurels at
82-79, taunted the Reds’ power
with a succession of finely pitch-
ed games. The playoff went to
the limit, but only Rose really
threatened—with bat and fist—
another New York miracle. His
home runs helped secure a pair
of one-run affairs (games one and
four); his punch-out with stick-
thin Bud Harrelson set off a
full-fledged brawl (high-lighted
by Red reliever Bourbon’s crazy
dash from bullpen safety to join
the fray), but his fists failed to
halt the drubbing of a 7-2 score.
It did give Shea Stadium fans a
chance to show their class and
sportsmanship, as they showered
the fuming Rose with trash and
beer bottles. Reds manager
Sparky Anderson piously deplor-
ed the crowd’s rowdiness—“I
didn’t think this could happen in
America.”—but the crimes of the
fans were no more shocking than
his own team’s failure to capture

Met’s-A’s: Baseball’s magic is back

Oakland expected to battle on
even terms. The five-game strug-
gle fulfilled such anticipations,
won by Oakland when Jim Hunter
tossed a sly shutout, his second
victory of the series. Baltimore
matched the A’s in most compara-
tive analyses, but lacked power,
clearly evidenced when the Birds
batted Tommie Davis at clean-up
until Earl Williams exhibited a
hot bat. On the contrary, Oak-
land boasted the lineup of Rudi,

Bando, Jackson, Johnson and
Tenace, each hitter capable of

homerun explosiveness.

Surprisingly, the playoff’s ma-
jor figure was the A’s shortstop
with a .239 season average, Bert
Campaneris. He hit consistently,
batting over .300 for the five
games, and clubbed two rare
home runs. In addition, his base-
running prowess led Oakland’s
hustle for runs, a necessary tactic
since the long ball won only the
second game for the team, a 6-3
pounding keyed by four A’s
blasts.

A disappointment throughout
was Reggie Jackson, the league’s
prime candidate for MVP honors
in 1973. Sadly, his impressive sea-
son of proficiency (382 HRs, 17
RBIN’s a .293 B.A.) never sur-
faced in the series, as the club’s
star fought a nagging virus and
the remnants of several late-sea-
son injuries.

On paper, the World Series
would appear to be an Oakland
cake-walk. Admittedly, there
exists a weakness in the middle

of the defense: an aging Dick
Green plays second base, and 2
variety of centerfielders, none too
dependable, try to sub for regular
Bill North, a costly casualty in
mid-September play. Yet, in com-
parison to the Mets, minor wor-
ries would seem academic. In
many ways, this New York crew
is a second-division bunch.
There’s little speed, no bonified
long-ball threat, a porous outfield.

Somehow, New York refuses to
recognize its mediocrity. Thus,
this one-sided statistical show is
proving to be an evenly matched,
exciting confrontation. The rea-
son for this equality is not all due
to the Mets’ vast improvement
over a season of less than awe-
some achievement. Rather, Oak-
land appears converted to the
New Yorkers’ helter-skelter style
of play, especially in the field.
Sunday’s game, won by New York
in 12 innings, well illustrates this
point. The slick-fielding A’s com-
mitted five errors. In the disastr-
ous 12th, stone-gloved Mike
Andrews dazzled the hometown
fans with two filling miscues on
routine grounders. Te be sure,
Andrews was Dick Williams’ third
second sacked of the game, and
has never sparkled in the field,
as Boston and Chicago fans will
testify. Yet his errors were crucial
ones, game-losers.

Then there’s an inexplicable ele-
ment present in this affair, Met-
magic. It really exists. On that
same Sunday of the unusual,

Macon outscores W&L, 34-26

One question many people on
campus asked last week was,
“Can Washington and Lee bounce
back from the trouncing admini-
stered by Hampden-Sidney?”

They proved Saturday that they
could.

Except they started their re-
bound one quarter too late.

Macon’s Yellow Jackets jumped
to a 21-0 first period lead and held
off the Generals’ fourth quarter
rally to win, 34-26, Saturday
afternoon in Ashland, Virginia.

W&L’s offense failed to gen-
erate an attack in the early
going, while the defense had its
hands full with Yellow Jacket
point-getters. Indeed, Randolph-
Macon totaled 347 yards for the
game, compared ot W&L’s 240.

After the initial stanza of
domination by Randolph-Macon,
one had to wonder if another
Hampden-Sydney debacle was
underway. It wasn’t.

The Generals looked as good as
they have all year in the second
quarter. The defense showed a
real toughness, while the offense
put everything together for the
first time in two weeks.

W&L’s 12 second quarter points
were the result of two long drives
engineered by quarterback Lewis
Powell. The senior signal-caller
completed 8 of 9 passes in the
period, good for 111 yards, and
connected on scoring strikes of
34 yards to Tony Perry, and 4
yards to Mark George.

The Powell to George TD cap-
ped a 70 yard drive which began
with 2:01 left in the half. Actu-

ally, less time than that was
available for the down-field
march, because the clock opera-
tor ran the clock twice when
timeouts had been called, wast-
ing 30 valuable seconds.
Randolph-Macon upped its lead
to 28-12 late in the third quarter
after Powell suffered his first
interception of the year. The
margin grew to 34-12 early in the
final period when the Yellow
Jackets managed a second theft.
Jack Berry replaced Powell at
quarterback, and promptly moved

down (Powell had _ started the
drive). Rob Lindsey scored from
the one, Powell returned and hit
George for the two-point conver-
sion, and the score stood at 34-20
with 3:27 left.

Then after Harry Smith pounc-
ed on a R-M fumble, Powell came
on to move the offense to still
another score. His two-yard boot-
leg with 1:27 remaining made it
34-26, as the following two-pointer
attempt failed.

But that was it.

Randolph-Macon ran out the
clock, as W&L ran out of time-

outs, and the game became his-
tory.

The loss evened W&L’s record
at 2-2, going into this Saturday’s
Homecoming contest with West-
ern Maryland.

Last year, on Western Mary-
land’s home turf, the Generals
fell 29-7, as Joe Brockmeyer gave
the W&L defense fits. However,
to the glee of all hoping for a
Homecoming triumph, he’s gone
now.

The game starts at 1:30 p.m. on
Wilson Field.

Soccer team splits 2 on road trip series

By MIKE McCOLLOCH
The Washington and _ Lee
varsity soccer team took to the
road last week for its first pair
of away games, losing to Johns
Hopkins 6-1, and then crushing
Lebanon Valley 9-0.

The loss to Hopkins on Wednes-
day was the first of the season
for the Generals. The lone W&L
goal was scored unassisted by Jim
Fox, with twenty minutes re-
maining in the second half. The
Hopkins’ players dominated
throughout the game, displaying

The Generals, who used a 1-1-4-4
formation, took only nine shots at
the goal, allowing Hopkins 23.

The following day the team em-
ployed a different formation, the

Washington and Lee scored
eight of the goals in the first
half, when the 4-3-3 was used,
and only one in the second half,
when the team returned to the
1-1-4-4. The Generals took 23 shots
at the goal during the game, hold-
ing Lebanon Valley to only three.

This gives W&L with a 4-1
record overall, and 2-0 in the divi-
sion. This week the team has

Where has all the porno gone?

By TOM RITTENBURG
To the many porno fans at

iis September proved to be some-
thing of a shock. The intrepid
ewers of such classics as ‘“Mid-
‘tht Plowboy” and “The Erotic
‘diventures of Zorro” were faced
‘th a fare of PGs and Oriental

Kung Fu films. The more _ de-
termined among these erotic

cinema fans were forced to play
“afonte Carlo” on treacherous
Route 501 to Lynchburg in order
see an X-1ated film.

The problem began with the
obscenity ruling by the Supreme
Court. The ruling gave the power
to censor films to the _ local
authorities in a community. The
ruling created massive confusion
as it eradicated the existing legal
framework on film censorship. In
Virginia this led a strong reaction
in some areas against explicit
films.

Tn Lexington there has not yet
heen a decision on X-rated films.
It is commonly thought that this

Slithering like a cobra through the underbrush of American society
Is a book that no establishment or even ‘‘underground’’ publisher ot

reviewer will touch.

It ignites an auto-da-fé under the Torquemadas of the liberal-minor-
ity inquisition, while showing up modern conservatives as the worst
enemies of conservatism. It makes everybody look bad except the ‘bad
guys’’—the Wasps and other Majority members who have been on the
wrong end of the intellectual slugfest for these many years.

Imagine, if you can, a scholarly work that takes the Majority side
in the great ethnic debate, that discusses the unassimilable minorities
objectively, that goes into such forbidden subjects as the biology of
revolution, that finds the chief cause of America’s decline to be genetic.

Social science teachers don’t answer the book. They just start

screaming.

Why not order this time bomb and start it ticking under the desks of
the liberal fantasts, Freudian frumps, conservative psychos, and Marxist
and Marcusian madhatters that infest your classrooms?

You'll scare the dogma out of them.

You'll also undogmatize yourself, and acquire a new sense of pur-
pose, as you suddenly see your country, your history and your people in

a totally new light.

sence of any controversial movies.
Ralph Daves, the manager of the
State and Lyric theaters, said that
the general upheaval caused by
the court ruling and the uncer-
tainty of the community’s  re-
action have led to a moratorium
on X-rated films. Daves pointed
out that he has not been subject
to any pressure from local gover-
ment or religious leaders. Also,
strangely enough, Daves has yet
to receive a complaint from a stu-
dent about the absence of porno
flicks this year.

“Red” Patton, a city councilman
of Lexington corroborated Daves’
story. Patton stated that the issue
has not been raised, nor even

spoken of, in the Council. If there
were a film in town considered
too explicit, it would be the re.
sponsibility of the Common-
wealth’s Attorney, Eric Sisler, to
bring the film into court. The
decision on a film would be
rendered in a local court,

The chances are that Sisler
won't get his day in court. The
only X-rated movie slated for the
Lyric in the near future is the
cartoon ‘Heavy Traffic” (by the
makers of “Fritz the Cat’). Until
there is a change of community
opinion here, the road to Lynch-
burg lies open to carry the die-
hards to the silver screens of the
Twin Fort Drive-In.

housing. Assuming the cost to the
individual is slightly over $700
a year, W&L’s apartments will
compare favorably with equival-
ent housing offered by other
schools.

The University of Delaware is
the only other school offering
student aparments with kitchens
and air-conditioning. However,
their units only have two _ bed-
rooms which are doubles. The
W&L Hilton will offer every oc-
cupant a single bedroom. Dela-
ware’s rental fee is $700 a year
for instate students, $800 for out-
of-state students. W&L will offer

the student a better deal than
that.
Of course, Washington and

apartments will be far
superior to those offered to the
Wahoos. The best C’ville can
boast is a student apartment with
five double bedrooms at $380 a
year. Hampshire College is Mass-

Lee's

achusetts offers apartments of
four single bedrooms with no
kitchen for $800 a vear. Again,
W&L leads the way.

On the whole, the university is
making a concerted effort to pro-
vide its students with superior
housing facilities. Whatever the
drawbacks of the project may be,
the value of the apartment com:
plex is certainly great and will
offer the student a viable al-
ternative. Students will be al
lowed to sign up for the new
housing in the Winter Term.
