Hemorrhage caused student death

By PAUL LANCASTER

A cerebral hemorrhage caused by a
snarp blow to the head has been listed as
the official cause of death of John Stanford
Mever, 18, a freshman at Washington and
Lee,

Meyer died Sunday shortly after 4 p.m.
in Stonewall Jackson Hospital.

The hemorrhage was located on the left
side of the head, apparently caused by a
blow on the opposite side. Such an occur-
rence happens frequently, according to
Rockbridge County Medical Examiner, Dr.
E. V, Brush,

Officials investigating the incident said
they have been unable to determine the
exact time and cause of the blow. Dr. Brush
said the injury could have occurred any-
where from four hours to four days before
jeath.

University officials hypothesize Meyer
mav have received the blow while swim-
ning in the new Doremus pool Saturday
afternoon. According to medical officials,
sfever may have been temporarily stunned
ov the blow and may have been unable
to remember it.

The injury was not visible as it was lo-
cated under Meyer’s hair.

Dr. David Oxley, duputy chief medical
examiner in Roanoke, likened the injury to
one received after a fall where the person
is unable to break the fall.

A meeting was held Monday night at the
Sigma Chi fraternity house, where Meyer
was a pledge, among students, administra-
tion, and Dr. Brush to reconstruct events
preceeding Meyer’s death Sunday afternoon.

Mever may have first showed symptoms
of the injury sometime late Saturday after-
noon. Dr. Brush said he talked with a num-
ber of students who reported Meyer’s ac-
tions may have been somewhat erratic at
that time.

Saturday night, Mever attended a party
at the Sigma Chi house. He was reported
to have consumed some alcohol, which some
officials speculate could have accelerated
the hemorrhage upon Meyer. The alcoho!
had no influence in the causation of the
hemorrhage, or in actually aggravating the
injurv, as far as the medical examiners
have been able to determine.

Meyer first “collapsed,” as medical of-
ficials phrase it, in Freshman Dorm I some
four hours after he had stopped drinking at
the Sigma Chi house. Officials said that
time lapse would rule out the possibility of
Mever collapsing from drinking.

After he collapsed, several freshmen in
the dorm put Meyer in the shower in an
attempt to revive him. They were unable to
do so. They then wrapped him up in a blan-
ket and set up a makeshift bed for him in
the “drving room” adjacent to the showers.

Several times Sunday morning, occu-
pants of the dorm section entered the show-
er area and attempted to wake Meyer up,
but thev were unable to do so and left him
to “sleep it off.”

By about 2 p.m., Meyer was still uncon-
scious in the shower room, and a dorm
counselor called Dr. Brush to the dormitory.
Reports are that Mever had begun to turn
blue in the face at that time.

From the dorm, he was taken to the uni
versity infirmary, where he began experi-
encing breathing difficulties. A respirator
was applied, but Dr. Brush said the respira-
tor was not functioning to his liking, and
he began to apply mouth-to-mouth resuscita-
tion. Several separate sources have denied
reports that there was a shortage of oxygen
in the infirmary. One rescue squad member
was heard to have said that the oxygen sup-
ply in one tank was low. Another tank of
oxygen was available, however.

While at the infirmary, Dr. Brush called
Stonewall Jackson Hospital for a drug for
treatment of intoxication, which was analyz-
ed at the time as possibly the only problem
Mever might have had.

The drug, however, was just recently
placed on the market for hospital use, and
was kept under lock and key in compliance
with federal regulations, according to a uni-
versity official. Apparently, the skeletal
staff at the hospital Sunday afternoon was
unable to locate anyone with a key to get
the drug and take it to the W&L infirmary.

Dr. Brush said he would not have used
the drug anyway, and it would not have
helped Meyer in any Case,

He was then transported to Stonewall
Jackson Hospital, where he died a short
time later.

Meyer was the son of Mr. and Mrs, Stan-
ford T. Meyer of Belleville, Ill. He was born
Aug, 8, 1955, in Fort Smith, Ark.

The funeral was held Wednesday in
Belleville. A memorial service was also held
Wednesday in Lee Chapel.

EC, Pate discuss financial aid situation

By ROBERT PUGH

A discussion with Dean Van
Pate, Director of Financial Aid,
took up most of Monday night’s
EC meeting.

The EC is considering a _ pro-
posal to endorse removal of the
luxury status for cars. Presently,
a percentage of car value is de-

ducted from a student’s financial
aid because cars are considered
luxuries. The Faculty Financial
Aid Committee has the authority
to enact a change.

Currently 38 students have
their awards adjusted because
they own cars. The total amount
involved is $10,600. Removal of
the restriction would increase aid

given to some students and conse-
quently prevent a few new stu-
dents from receiving money.
Two student representatives on
the faculty committee, senior Bill
Hill and junior Bill Lassetter, ap-
peared with Dean Pate. The EC
plans to discuss the matter fur-
ther with the faculty committee.

Faculty changes J-school requirements

By STEVE YEVICH

The faculty’s Executive Com-
mittee reported to a closed ses-
sion of the faculty Monday it is
still examining the request made
bv the University Council on Nov.
1 concerning faculty debates. The
UC proposed that a summary of
debate in faculty meetings be
made available to the student
body through the student news
services when asked to do so by
any member of the UC.

A proposal to change the re-
quirements for a major in journa-
lism was approved. Under the
new plan, 29 credits in specific
courses will be required, as op-

posed to twenty-four credits now.
An additional 12 credits, at pre-
sent to be taken from upper-level
courses in the humanities and
social sciences, will be limited to
courses numbered 200 and above
in history, politics, economics and
sociology.

Tabled until the March meet-
ing was a proposal requiring the
UC to consult the faculty prior to
drawing up the school calendar.

A plan to permit freshmen to
be given credit for college work
under the conditions as credit is
given for transfer work was ap-
proved, Also passed were pro-
posals to add three new courses

to the curriculum, one on British
literature and the others on East
Asian history.

The deadline for applications
for independent majors, currently
specified as prior to the begin-
ning, of the junior vear, has been
changed to prior to the end of the
first term of the junior year.

Independence of independents

Two-thirds of this vear’s freshmen class pledged fraternities fol-
lowing Rush, and now they shall be indoctrinated into the fun and
games of fraternity life at Washington and Lee. But what happens to
the one-third which did not pledge?

Those of the minority have two choices: they can individually seek
active social lives according to their own individual whims, or they
can join the Independent Union, which is roughly equivalent to the
first prerogative.

Just what is the Independent Union? The Student Handbook de-
scribes it as “all students not affiliated with a fraternity, and (it) is
primarily for athletic purposes. All independents interested in par-
ticipating in intramural athletics may subscribe to the Union’s ath-
letic program .... The President of the Independent Union holds a
position on the Student Affairs Committee, from which he furthers
independent interests and viewpoints.”

And the catalog describes the Union as a non-fraternity organiza-
tion “which, like fraternities, sponsors intramural athletic and social
activities.”

But the Independent Union does not sponsor social activities, and
it does little in the way of sponsoring independent intramural teams.
Any group of independents interested in organizing a team for intra-
murals may do so without any acknowledgment from the Union.
Often, two or more independent teams participate in any intramural
sport, if any independent team participates at all.

In fact, no one is quite sure what the function of the Independent
Union is. Its purpose, nominally at least, is to provide a focal point
for the interests of the independents at W&L. This may have been
fine 10 or more years ago when everyone who was anyone joined a
fraternity and independents were merely brushed off as collective
“fish” of sorts. But now independents account for somewhere around
40 percent of the undergraduate student body.

The focus of independent activity, or inactivity, as it were, seems
to be Davis Dorm. Indeed, this is where all the officers of the Union
reside, and this is where elections are held each Spring. The elections
are held in Davis primarily because that is the easiest location for of-
ficers to round up a quorum of 15 students (as required by the con-
stitution of the Union) for elections. And the elections are held, and
the new officers are left with the responsibility of rounding up a
quorum next Spring for elections. There is not much else to do be-
yond that.

Actually, there is little else that can be done beyond that. The
Union certainly cannot force anyone to pay dues to pay for any
activities. There is something like four dollars in the Independent
Union’s treasury. What can a group do with four dollars?

The crux of the problem is that the independents are, well, inde-
pendent. Together they form a mish-mash, a potpourri of individualists
with no common interests besides their individualsm. How does some-
body form a cohesive group of individuals?

The hierarchy of the Independent Union as it now exists is merely
a group of four men elected by what could be called an independent
group of independents within the confines of Davis Dorm who took
the time (all of 15 minutes) to vote their friends into office. So are
the officers elected.

As outlined in the Handbook, the president of the Union does have
a function—to represent independent interests on the Student Affairs
Committee as one of five students and another five faculty and admini-
stration members. The other students are the president of the Inter-
fraternity Council, a Student Bar Association member representing
the law school, chairman of the Student Control Committee, and presi-
dent of the student body. SAC reviews decisions of the Student Con-
tro] Committee.

What the vice-president, secretary, and treasurer do, no one is
quite sure. There are specific “powers” delineated in the Independent
Union constitution, but the sum of these could probably be handled by
the president alone without much help. And so, the Independent Union
is almost an “in name only” organization representing in reality a
small fraction of the 550 or so independents on campus.

The possibility arises, however, that this may be all anybody
really wants out of the Independent Union. The fraternity boys could
certainly care less about the independents, and most independents
could certainly care less about the independents.

Perhaps the Independent Union only has one valid function as it
now exists, and perhaps it should only have one valid function: to
provide a voice for independent views (even if the views are those
of a small percentage of indpendents) wherever those views are
needed.

There is a representative of the Interfraternity Council on the
Student Affairs Committee, and consequently there should be a voice
for independents, too. There should be an independent view to offset
all fraternity views per se in any organization or committee on cam-
pus, save for the IFC itself.

The plight of the independents should be studied, preferably by a
group such as the Executive Committee, to determine what, if any-
thing, can be done to see that the Independent Union is representing
the independent view where needed, and that the Union, for the most
part, is not just an “in name only” organization,

Black rap

Questions

By JOHNNY E. MORRISON

The Washington and Lee Uni-
versity, in the year 1970-71, de-
cided to explore a region of life
which had been treaded upon by
many institutions of higher learn-
ing. These same institutions have
previously done everything un-
der the heavens to exclude a very
important and relevant segment
of society from their Chambers.

Like other institutions in the
country, these private institutions
which cherished hemselves on a
demanding academic environment
in which the professors set high-
er standards for the students
were faced with the fact that
Blacks would no longer be com-
placent and inferiorly oriented.

Washington and Lee’s academ-
ic community has had to make
one of the important and com-
plex decisions in its history. This
decision was important because
it would decide whether the Uni-
versity would follow a pattern of
continuously making the Univer-
sity a haven for those who still
cling to the belief that the world
is all white and it would always
remain all white. It was complex
and challenging in respects that
if the University did choose to ad-
mit Blacks, it would embark on
on a new realm of life on a trial-
and-error basis.

Now that there is over one
percent of the student body who
are Black, the University can,
with both joy and reservation,
sign its name to that “Golden
Plaque” which all institutions of
higher learning sign after they
step in to reality. I say with re-
servation because both the Black
students and University alike
have come to the realization that
in order for the Black student to
be a full and total student, he not
only has to be engrossed in the
books of learning but he also has
to be a happy student who wants
to be an integral part of the stu-
dent body.

In order for the University to
offer the Black students an op-
portunity to be active partici-
pants in the everyday operations
of the school, it must first at-
tempt to ask “itself” what are its

long range goals. Does it—the
University—wish to apply the
maintenance function and con-
tinue to strive on a very undiver-
sified student body, a very undi-
versified Board of Trustees, 4
very undiversified faculty and 3
very undiversified administration
or must it apply the concept of
malleability and change?

This is a perplexing question
which I believe the University
has been seeking an answer and
solution to for the last six year's.
Regardless how perplexing the
question and how arduous it is to
arrive at a solution, it would be a
grave and debililating mistake if
the University spends the next
six years asking that same ques-
tion.

Another area which is pertin-
ent to look at is the curriculum.
This university is considered one
of the best schools in the South.
The question that should be ask-
ed is whether the student is of:
fered a curriculum which can be
applied to his everyday contact
with society after he graduates?
Is the University geared towards
the illimitable freedom of the
body-where every studnt is re-
quired to take five semesters of
physical education and see who
can break the record for making
the most road trips—or is it gear-
ed towards the illimitable free-
dom of the mind-where every stu-
dent is required to take a course
in social problems and present
political thought?

In essence, the University must
conceive of itself as being part of
a changing and diversified society
and project this same thought on
its student body.

The readers of this article may
think that I have digressed from
expounding on one of the many
problems that Blacks encounter
at this university. Well, I have
not because I have not been dere-
lict in this respect. I have only
done what I set out to do; to at-
tempt to show a complacent stu-
den body that many of the prob-
lems that the Blacks have to con-
front face to face are also that
whole student body’s problems.

And then there is Pauline Kael,
film critic for The New Yorker.

After all the others have said
their piece and the din dies down,
she roars out her point of view.

As is true with any other critic,
Miss Kael’s point of view doesn’t
always meet with the public’s ap-
proval and it seldom meets with
that of other critics.

Yet, when others would ac-

away at movies she doesn’t like,

for a tawdry, corrupt world” or
praising them as “the most total
and encompassing art form we
have,” she never ceases to care.

As Kenneth Paul Shorey, film
critic for The Birmingham News,
put it, “Pauline Kael takes every
movie she sees as being addressed
to her personally.”

Since she became film critic for
The New Yorker in 1968, she has
become notorious, if not famous,
among filmgoers and film critics
alike.

And all shake their heads and
wonder what makes her tick.

[ asked her in a telephone con-
versation what her standards for
judging movies are, and Miss
Kael answered, “Nobody in any
art has any standards. You just
use everything you've got.”

She added that her background
and experience have much to do
with how she sees a movie.

“The critic puts his own experi-
ence on the line so you have a
picture of the critic through his
writing. What matters is what
shows in the critiques,” she said.

She admits her evaluations are
based largely on her “gut reac-
tion” to a movie.

And that gut reaction is based
on many in tangibles—her knowl-
edge of films and directors, her
experience as a critic, her per-
sonal background and others.

She does not base her opinion
on how the other critics see a
film, how the public likes it or
on industry promotions but slams
Academy Award winners as well
as recognized losers.

She never slams without reason
but, when she dislikes a film, she
pulls no punches in telling why.

Themes aren’t the only part of
a picture that is subject to her
pen pounding and almost every
facet of a film is socked at one
time or another,

Camera technique, photography,
director, actors and actresses —
nothing escapes comment if it’s
significant.

Miss Kael explodes at “Dr. Zhi-
vago.”’

“Tt isn’t shoddy (except for the
music), it isn’t soap opera; it’s
stately, respectable and dead: the
photography static, the comings
and goings without rhythm,” she
said.

The surprising discovery is that
all this comes from the same critic
who honestly enjoyed “The Planet
of the Apes” as “one of the best
science-fiction fantasies ever to
come out of Hollywood.”

Pauline Kael is difficult, if not
impossible, to pin down when it
comes time to figure out what
will be damned and what will be
praised,

And those who. sit around,
scratch their noses and hope to
make the discovery will be scrat-
ching a long time.

Not only are they wasting their
time, they are missing the point:
Whether Pauline Kael likes or
dislikes a particular film is only
important because of the reasons
she gives for delivering her ver-

Record Review

Santana’s newest-
Where it came from

By W. PATRICK HINELY

Santana’s new Welcome (co-
lumbia PC 32445) is consistent
with his previous non-live albums
in its excellence. The production
job by Carlos, drummer Mike
Shrieve, and keyboard man Tom
Coster puts a lot of potentially
centrifugal elements together
quite well.

With help from the likes of
Leon Thomas, Joe Farrell, and
Flora Purim, Santana has shifted
his role as a musician from that
of an originator to that of a chan-
nel. As a creative force, Santana
has always been good but rather
limited. His albums with Mc-
Laughlin (who also appears on
one cut of the new record) show-
ed how Carlos is capable of en-
larging his style through absorb-
ing elements from the styles of
others. Welcome is a continuation
of this process.

The one influence who comes
to mind first is Airto Moreira, a
Brazilian percussionist who, like
many “names” in jazz, started
many “names” in jazz, started
his American career with Miles
Davis. (Miles Davis at Fillmore,
Columbia G30088).

To date, Airto has four albums
of his own. The first two, Na-
tural Feelings (Buddah BDS 21-
SK) and Seeds on the Ground
(Buddah BDS 5085), are largely
native Brazilian music played by,
yes, native Brazilians. Airto
knows a lot of good musicians
from back home, and they help
him make his records.

His third album, Free (CTI
6020), showcases two of today’s
leading keyboard wizards, Keith
Jarrett and Chick Corea. Corea’s
“Return to Forever” is given a
beautiful rendition on this record,
and the song serves as an excel-
lent introduction to the man who
may well be the best keyboard
man around today. (more about
him in my next piece).

Fingers (CTI 6028), Airto’s lat-
est, bears the closest direct resem-
blance to Santana, or vice-versa,
for Fingers was finished while
Santana was just getting started
on Welcome. Airto’s new sound
is a cooled-out funky latino-elect-
ric easy-going kind of music, if
you can dig that.

Santana’s new sound is very
much like it, though you can
still tell its origins were in the
best LSD tradition of San Fran-
cisco; Airo didn’t have that bar-
rier to overcome. He just started
in the open spaces of Brazil, and
it’s his new band, also Brazilians,
but somewhat younger who add
the electricity.

South Americans seem to have
a way of playing with a lot of
feeling. Some music closely akin
to Santana and Airto, though in
a distinctly different vein, is that
of Gato Barbieri. Most of today’s
“acknowledged” saxophonists
tend to be on the abstract side

‘

(also called
“noisy”).

Gato is the exception. His plav-
ing is consistently lyrical, as well
as beautiful. Airto does some ex:
cellent percussion and drumming
on Gato’s latest “new” album,
Bolivia (Flying Dutchman 10158).

A more recent record has been
released on the Impulse label,
but it is meretly-old-tracks Gato
did with some fellow Argentinans
back in the ’60’s. His best record.
to date, for my money, is Under
Fire (Flying Dutchman 10156),
which also features Airto, along
with bassist Stan Clarke (now
with Corea’s new band), conga
player James M’tume, and pian-
ist Lonnie Liston Smith. Gato has
an amazing ability to get a good
band going full force and then
scream over the top of them and
take the total sound even higher.

Other names come to mind on
the subject of latin music. Baden
Powell, the Brazilian guitarist,
has a mere 34 albums out now.
Unfortunately, none of them are
on American labels and are thus
hard to get. The three I’ve heard
have been very impressive.

He tends to be very emotional
in his writing and playing, but it
comes across powerfully because
he’s such a master guitarist
Powell never has taken more than
three days to make a record, and
the ones I’ve heard don’t have
any mistakes. I guess he just does
it right the first time.

A Brazilian who is_ probably
maikng more waves on the air-
waves than any other these days,
in the States that is, is Eumir
Deodato. His first album, Prelude
(CTI 6021) contained the latin
version of the 2001 theme which
made it so big a short ways back.
As it turns out, that was almost
the weakest cut on the album.

Deodato is the only man I’ve
heard who can use a lot of orches-
tration without it bogging down
in a kind of muzak-like swamp.
His new album, Deodato Two
(CTI 6029), is even more promis:
ing. He straddles the borderline
between easy listening and pro-
gressive jazz, blending elements
of the two genres quite well.

And it’s a small world. Deodato
is also the man who arranged
Antonio Carlos Jobim’s Stone Flo.
wer album (CTI 6002) a few
vears back. That record contains
the original version of the title
song, which Santana made known
to the rock audience with a fine
electrified rendition on the Cara.
vanserai album of last year.

Airto’s wife, Flora Purim, who
does vocals on all his records,
also sings on the new Santana
album. Tom Coster, Santana’s
keyboard man and co-producer,
formerly with Gabor Szabo, hung
out with Airto and Flora for a
while, too. Funny how musical
styles get around and who ends
up getting credit for them.

a schools disdain P-F

By TIM MOORE

Students whose academic rec-
ords include a substantial amount
of pass-fail courses are at a dis-
tinct distadvantage in applying to
graduate and professional schools
according to a recent nationwide
educational survey.

An article in the fall issue of
Educational Record by Edward I.
Stevens reported that admission
officers at more than 300 gradu-
ate schools thought that evalua-
tion of pass-fail grades was “ex-
tremely difficult, if not imposs-
ible’. Stevens asserts that pass-
fail grades are the most disad-
vantageous at professional
schools.

“The greater the proportion of
a student’s record which is re-
ported in terms of a non-tradi-
tional grading system, the greater
the potential for difficulty in en-

“Non-traditional grading
tems” include almost any scale
other than the A-F gamut. The
survey showed that many schools,

which a “P” in some cases repre-
sents. Another antipathy that ad-
mission officers have for the P-F
system is the time required to
evaluate the student’s work.

sys-

“At present the task of evalua-
tion requires much reading and
interpretation of grades, recom-
mendations, and activities. To add
copious evaluation in lieu of
grades would be frowned upon in
light of 5500 applications.”

Also, the survey indicated that
students graded on a_pass-fail
basis have difficulty in obtaining

financial aid at most graduate
schools.
For prospective law students,

increasing emphasis on the evalu-
ation of LSAT scores is occuring
when a student’s record shows a
large number of pass-fail courses.
In these cases the law school
scores are the only measurement
of a student’s aptitude.

Stevens also pointed out some
impressive difference that exist
between undergraduate colleges

and graduate or _ professional
schools: “ oo per cent of the
undergraduate institutions view

the credit-no credit system as de-
sirable, acceptable, or presenting
only minor problems while only
17 per cent of graduate schools of
arts and sciences, 14 per cent of
law schools, and 6 per cent of
medical schools feel similarly.”

Stevens suggests that those “less
than highly prestigious” institu-
tions which adopt a nonstandard
grading system should plan to as-
sist those students who “opted”
for a large number of pass-fails
and who are applying to graduate
or professional schools, “with es-
pecially comprehensive letters,
annotated grade reports, and
other devices.”

Then came Monday night’s loss
at Lynchburg College, a game in

which a considerable second-half

lead proved insufficient. Thus,
going into Wednesday’s contest
with Baltimore, VCAA play-off

hopes were shelved, at least tem-
porarily, for the more basic con-
siderations of a .500 pre-Christmas
standing.

In the opening period against
Clinch Valley, the Generals par-
layed outside shooting and the
ineptitude of their opponents’
ball-handling into an insurmount-
12-21 half-time = lead. The
W&L attack operated almost flaw-
lessly at times, particularly when
allowed to run. The shuffling of
guard combinations kept the Gen-
erals’ floor leadership fresh, the
Clinch Valley turnover rate high.
Indeed, the visitors often appear-
ed unable to set up any sort of
fluid offensive pattern, being self-
made victims of numerous travel-
ing violations and errant passes.

Only the capable shooting of
center Pete Vance (16 points)
kept CV close to any measure of
respectability, as the Generals
threatened to turn the second-
half rout into a humiliation.

Particularly, Norm Kristoff dis-
plaved flashes of great ability
early in the final stanza, controll-
ing the boards and scoring several
closely-bunched baskets, totaling
11 points for the night. Coach
Canfield substituted freely, em-
ploying 14 players in the build-
ing of the final, 37-point margin.

Guard play highlighted the vic-
tory, especially the blistering ac-
curacy of junior Bow Williams.
His ability to bomb from outside
20 feet gave him 21 points, to lead
the scoring attack. (Lichtfuss add-
ed 15).

able

Saturday night’s annual affair
against big-time Virginia offered
far more excitement than merely
an opportunity to see an ACC
team in Doremus. To be sure, for
the sizeable number of Cavalier
fans who journeyed to Lexington
anticipating a rout, the game was
a rude awakening.

In fact, W&L controlled much
of the opening half’s play, man-
handling Virginia’s starting
guards Al Drummond and Andy
3oninti. Only Gus Gerard’s sizz-
ling shot-percentage kept the Wa-
hoo’s attack functional in the in-
itial going. W&L held a 16-14 edge
six minutes into the half, and had
Virginia coach Bill Gibson search-
ing his bench for personnel able
to counter the tough W&L per-
formance.

Unfortunately, he found them.
With the score deadlocked at 20,
freshman Bill Langlogh and sen-
ior Bob McKeag entered the
game, and the style and tempo of
the contest were radically altered.
Langlogh’s poise belied his first-
status in giving his team
sharp passes, defensive quickness,
and effective shooting. The W&L
zone, so impressive in the early
minutes, McKeag utiliz-
ed his bearish bulk and hot hand

n, cruelly, a dismal stretch of
cold shooting plagued W&L, and a
30-28 U.Va. advantage

However, the Generals were in
no way subdued. Outstanding play

with 16 points and a similar num-

rebounds,

ber of outclassed the
likes of Lanny Stahurski and Ed

Schletick, closing the gap to seven

points in early second-half mo-
ments.
Again, disturbingly, the Gen

erals’ field-goal accuracy suffered,
particularly from the outside
W&L guards, stellar performet

in Friday’s victory, managed but
seven baskets in 29 attempts from
the floor. Also, turnovers result
ing from the Virginia press undid
the Generals midway through the
final stanza, as a 10-point differ-
ence swelled to 20.

In contrast, Virginia’s shooting
percentages fattened, as McKeag
and Wally Walker both enjoyed a
profitable scoring half. For the
game, McKeag poured in 16
points, while Walker’s combined
quickness and size enabled him
to tally 22, the game-high.

The Generals, though losers by
23, actually took more shots and
gathered more rebounds’ than
their taller, well-scholarshipped
adversaries. However, a 33% field
goal percentage severly damaged
the cause, especially when juxta
posed to U.Va.’s 52% mark.

Skip Lichtfuss fared well indi
vidually for the night, a genuine

scoring threat from inside and
out_seoring 21 points to lead
W&L’s offensive totals. Of note,
John Podgajny’s late-game pet-

formance kept excitement intact,
as he hustled for 10 points and
played aggressive defense in the
already-determined contest.
