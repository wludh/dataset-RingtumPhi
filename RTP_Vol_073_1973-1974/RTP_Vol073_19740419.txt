Stickmen to face Wahoos

Vol. LX XIII

By BILL AUSTIN

Washington and Lee’s lacrosse
fortunes wlil be put to a stern
test tomorrow afternoon when
the fourth-ranked Generals travel
to Charlottesville to meet third-
ranked U.Va.

The unbeaten W&L squad car-
ries a 7-0 intercollegiate won-lost
mark into the contest, while the
Cavaliers, will be attempting to
rebound from a 25-13 humbling
administered by the University of
Maryland.

The Generals garnered three
wins in play over the spring va-
cation. On Wednesday, the team
rallied from a 3-2 half-time deficit
to topple Princeton, 12-7. The fol-
lowing afternoon, W&L clobbered

C. W. Post, 20-5, and on Saturday
tamed Duke University, 16-7.

This past Wednesday, the Gen-
erals hosted a sound University of
North Carolina outfit, a team that
had previously given U.Va. a real
scare before bowing, 11-7. In simi-
lar fashion, the Tar Heels proved
lar competitors for two periods
at Wilson Field, and trailed by
only 7-5 at half-time. Nonetheless,
the Generals put together an im-
pressive post-intermission effort,
and took the contest, 18-8.

As for-THE GAME ... Sinee

mustering. If such an observation
offers a good omen for General
chances, it is also made with con-
siderable uneasiness.

As always, the Cavs are able to
score with explosive swiftness.
Then too, there is an element of
revenge involved. Last year,

Number 23

W&L tamed the invading State U
behind a memorable scoring per-
formance by Ted Bauer. Thus, the
honor of Thomas Jefferson's
prideful institution is at stake,
jeopardized once more by _ its
small-sized Lexington neighbor.
Game-time is 2 p.m.

New fraternity formed

By TOM RITTENBURG

Despite the seeming decline of
fraternities, a “new” fraternity
has been formed at W&L.

The Iota Alpha Chapter of Al-
pha Phi Alpha was organized on
campus in January of this year.
The frattrnity had its start at Cor-
nell University in 1906 when
seven students there organized
this first Black fraternity, Its
aims were established as “manly
deeds,” scholarship, and love for
al! mankind.

Alpha Phi Alpha took another
giant forward step in becoming
the first integrated fraternity in
1945.

Alpha Phi Alpha took root at
W&L when five students desired
a chapter here to promote service
to the community. Charter mem-
bers include President Larry Alex-
ander, Secretary John Evans, and
Treasurer “Elf Freeman. Other
charter members are Bobby
Smith and Johnny Morrison,

Today there are the five Char-
ter members and nine sphinxmen
(pledges) in the chapter. The
sphinxmen are not Rushed, but
are invited to join by the mem-
bers. Candidates must have com-
pleted two semesters of study and
hold a 2.0 grade point average to
join. Interested students are en-

Sanford to speak here Wednesday

Terry Sanford, president of
Duke University and former gov-
ernor of North Carolina, will
speak on prospects for the Demo-
cratic party in the 1976 Presiden-
tial election next Wednesday
(April 24) at Washington and
Lee University.

His address — which will be
the first formal event in prepara-
tion for the 1976 W&L mock ocn-
vention—will take place at 8 p.m.
in Lee Chapel. Members of the
public are invited to attend as
guests of the Mock Convention.

Sanford, who presented himself
as a progressive moderate alter-
nate to Gov. George Wallace in
the 1972 North Carolina Democra-
tic primary, was that state’s gov-

ernor from 1961 to 1965. He be-
came president of Duke in 1969.
He has been a delegate to each
Democratic national convention
since 1956. Sanford is also active
in education organizations, hav-
ing served as chairman of the
Southern Regional Education
Board and chairman of the board
of the National Council of Inde-
pendent Colleges and Universities
and on many other agencies con-
cerned with higher education,
The 1976 W&L convention will
be the university’s 16th. Unlike
most other college conventions,
W&L’s traditionally seeks to pre-
dict the actual nominee of the
party out of power, rather than
the most popular candidate. In

1972 W&L students predicted Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy would emer-
ge as the Democratic nominee —
their fifth error in 15 conventions,
and just their second with a De-
mocrat. Despite the wrong pre-
diction, the W&L convention’s 10-
for 15 record remains the most
accurate among colleges which at-
tempt to anticipate the actual re-
sult of the national convention.

Sanford’s appearance is the first
in a two-year series of programs
involving persons of influence in
the national Democratic party.
The events are planned by the
student leadership of the Mock
Convention to provide an “insid-
er’s” picture of attitudes and pro-
cedures in the party .

couraged to inquire further.

The main drive of the frater-
nity is to address itself to every
aspect of impoverished America.
Every Chapter must establish 2
scholarship fund at their school
as the first step in this commun-
ity program. The present social
action program involves caring
for the elderly of Lexington.

The long-range program in-
volves an international effort to
use economic power to eliminate
the poverty-ridden ghettoes of
the world. Working towards that
goal, the entire membership at-
tended the state convention of Al-
pha Phi Alpha (twenty four Chap-
ters in all) in Charlottesville
March 8-10, There the groundwork
for the actualization of this pro-
gram was begun.

Alpha Phi Alpha is also con-
cerned with social activities. At
this time the Chapter is planning
a Spring Ball for this term. The
date for this event will be an-
nounced later. Alpha is also con-
cerned with campus fraternity
life, and the chapter is a member
of the LF.C,

EC to study proposed
restructuring of UC

Plans are underway for restruc-
turing the University Council.

Next Monday the EC will de-
cide whether to accept, amend, or
reject the UC recommendation
that the composition of student
membership be changed. Students
are urged to attend and make
their views known.

Currently there are four sen.
iors, three juniors, two sopho-
mores, and one freshman. Under
the proposal there would be two
from each undergraduate class,
the President of the IFC, and the
Chairman of the Student Control
Committee. The law school repre-
sentation (two members) and the
President of the Student Body
would also still be on the Council

be greater communication _ be-
tween the Student Affairs Com-
mittee and the UC by trying to
put more members of SAC on the

chairman of the SCC are on SAC,

What happened to coeducation?

Last vear at this time, fiery debates were raging over the
question of coeducation.

For the second year in a row, a referendum was held ask-
ing students if they favored allowing women into the under-
graduate school. In 1972, the students were 60 percent op-
posed and 40 percent in favor. Last year that vote was re-
versed amidst vows to run a third refeerndum this year in an
effort to discern a trend among students on the issue. Further,
a primary issue of the election for student body president
last year was coeducation—one candidate for it; the other,
opposed. The candidate for it won.

What's happened?

Coeducation is no longer the steaming issue that it was last
year at this time. The issue wasn't even raised during the
Big Three and subsequent Executive Committee and class of-
fice elections. Is the issue dead?

Student Body President Doug Schwartz is the man who
made coeducation such an issue last year. And he won the
election perhaps because he was in favor of it. It is to him
where we would obviously turn to find out what happened.
why a coeducation referendum wasn’t offered either during
the Big Three or the EC and class office elections.

The problem is that Schwartz is obvious by his unique
position. Schwartz is the blend of two groups on campus:
those in favor of coeducation, and those interested in the co-
education issue.

Schwartz is nearly unique as a blend of two groups. Others
who favor coeducation seem not to be motivated enough by
the issue to try to get something done. And others who are
motivated by the issue—the Board of Trustees, for example—
are not necessarily in favor of it.

Thus, Schwartz’s only allies as far as motivation is con-
cerned are against coeducation, and his only allies as far as
favoring coeducation aren't motivated. A bit simplified? Per-
haps. But unfortunately true.

Beat them damn Wahoos

This week’s battle of the century is upon us.

Saturday, the undefeated, fourth-ranked Washington and
Lee lacrosse team clears across the Blue Ridge for a match
against this state’s “other” lacrosse team, the University of
Virginia.

Virginia, of course, is ranked ahead of Washington and
Lee, just as it was, of course, at the end of last season, even
though the Generals topped the Wahoos, 15-11, during that
season.

Noting that, we wonder if a win at U.Va. Saturday would
send us plummeting in the rankings, perhaps behind Navy.
After all, we beat the Midshipmen, 13-10, on their own field
already this year; why shouldn’t they be ranked ahead of us.

Rankings aside, however, Saturday's match-up is admitted-
ly this year’s most important game for the Generals, at least
in the regular season. A sound win could move W&L up in
the poll to the top position (that is, if you count Maryland’s
monopoly on ths number one lacrosse ranking only as an hon-
orary position—seemingly, few persons think anyone can even
begin to ascend the mountain of which Maryland is king. The
Terps have been considered in a class by themselves for most
of the season now).

And a sound defeat could send W&L sprawling to the bot-
tom of the top 10, down among such lowly schols as Cornell
and Navy.

The importance of the game Saturday was recognized even
before the season began. The administration of this school,
deeming Saturday a make-up for Monday’s lost classes, took
the game into account. Monday afternoon classes were schedul-

ed not for the afternoon of the lacrosse game, but for Friday

Remembering May 4

Sir:

Around May 4 it will be the
fourth anniversary of the Wash-
ington and Lee Student Strike.
Whewww. What with Spiro Ag-
new—who? — John Mitchell go-
mg ... Mixon going... € Ba
Hoover gone ... the FBI admitt-
ing it may have been involved in
syping on and killing off Black

Panthers and other dangerous
species .. the CIA admitting that
it never heard of itself... eight

new William Calley’s indicted in
the Kent State murders... and
George Wallace at least incapable
of reproduction, one might won-
der if things haven’t worked
themselves out after all?
Nothing comes out perfectly
clear. So I’m not amazed that a
hot blooded college student these
days has to go to a truck stop to
strike, after all, the name of the
group that started the strike at
W&L was THE LEE-HI TRUCK-
STOP LIBERATION FRONT.
Lookout: we are possessed.
Coincidences continue to inter-
est me. Take for example, the
way the universities unloaded
“radical” professors in the four
vears that have followed the
strikes. The way admissions de-
partments have tightened up on
the politics they want to let in
(blame it on the end of the
draft?). The way the oil com-
panies, the military, the “investi-
gatory agencies,” are more safely
and smilingly welcomed back to
contribute their money and re-
cruit students (although my fel-
low alumnae seem not to be con-
tributing too much, except for the
one who got back from Africa
and found that the only mail he
had gotten was from Bill Wash-
burn, so what would anyone else
do but send some money?). The
deep, dark chasm of student un-
rest was very quickly covered-up.
Pardon me. It is in very poor
taste to use that term with regard
to an educational institution. Why
“cover-up?” It nearly draws a
comparison with, oh well, I’d
rather not say that—it’s almost

TERS TO THE EDITOR

 

like saying that the same type of
mind responsible for that Water-
closet—gate—mess can be found
teaching-running-attending Wash-
ington and Lee University. Jeeeee-
eeez I wouldn’t want to suggest
such a horrible thought. After all,
you all’s the future of America,
right? Far Right!

Some of the kind folks who are
no doubt pompously proclaiming
just how awful the government
has sudenly turned out to be, also
were responsible for terminating
Henry Sloss’s teaching career, one
long year short of tenure. These
kind folks have their excuses.
Want to hear some of them? He
didn’t gave enough exams; he
gave blanket C’s; he didn’t get
another degree (but we don’t re-
quire our professors to publish or
perish, hah hah hah!); he just
couldn’t teach; he didn’t fit in;
he was better off, why everyone
concerned was probably better
off; etc., etc. People in the street,
I understand, have a term for ex-
cuses like this. The term is called
“Bullshit.”

Henry Sloss got fired for politi-
cal reasons. But ask around and
no one will tell you that. No more
than they have been saying that
Sal Allende shot himself because
the truck drivers were on strike.
That one hasn’t been used in this
country lately. I don’t understand.
Oh well. Sloss was embarrassing
to the justifications for the con-
tinued existence of many local
jellyfish who quickly sprouted
backbones after Sloss left. I won-
der how many of these people are
criticizing Nixon for his lack of
integrity? They would have told
us all so... if we had asked.
They, regretably, had more im-
portant things to do at the time.
Allow me to relate my course to
what is happening in the world
these daze ... ah, well, how do
vou expect me to relate literature,
history, politics, journalism, thea-
ter, law, to anything in the noose
today? B’sides, I told him, I said
‘Henry, Sloss, keep that mouth 0’
yaws shut, or you're gonna get

aiternoon. A wise move by the administration indeed; no-
body would have showed for those classes if they were sche-
duled Saturday afternoon. Everybody would have been at the
lacrosse game, or at least they could have said they were at
the lacrosse game,

We hope the administration was right in assuming every-
one would be at the lacrosse game Saturday. For as rah-rah
as it sounds, W&L certainly has found something to sing the
W&L Swing about—lacrosse.

A review

The.

Exorcist

By PAUL LANCASTER

When Director William Fried-
kin spoke at the State Theatre last
month, he said his latest movie,
“The Exorcist,” promised to be
“the biggest grossing movie of all
time.”

He was right.

It’s gross.

The grossness of the special ef-
fects would perhaps not have
seemed so obvious, except that
they constituted the best part of
the movie.

William Peter Blatty, the auth-
or of “The Exorcist,” would have
been so disgusted with the film,
he would have walked out of the
theatre when he saw it, or so I
thought. Rather, he walked on—
for a brief moment. strolling
across the campus of Georgetown
University.

The movie begins in northern
Ivaq, at an archaeological “dig.”
Twenty minutes later, the audi-
ence is still at the site of the dig.
Those who read the book know
the point of the northern Iraq
scene could have been made in
ten minutes or less; those who
didn’t read the book were still
wondering what the hell northern
Iraq had to do with an exorcist
in this country. At the end of the
movie, they were probably still
wondering why northern Iraq
merited about a fifth of the entire
film’s projection time.

Simply, the connection between
northern Iraq and the exorcism
in Georgetown could have been
made in a much briefer span of
time. It dragged.

Perhaps because of that long
waste of film, Regan had to be
“possessed” in the film much
more rapidly than she was in the
book. In the movie, it seemed like
one day she was well, and almost
the next day she was no longer
Regan but the Devil himself, vom-
iting, turning his head completely
around, and cursing in some
more-than-startling words.

As it is determined that there
is nothing physically wrong with
Regan, her mother turns to Fath-
er Karras of Georgetown Univer-
sity. He explains to her that an
exorcism, suggested by psycholo-
gists who couldn’t find out what
was wrong with Regan, would be
nearly impossible to obtain, or so
he implied. Moments later, in the
film anyway, the exorcism is ap-
proved by the Catholic Church
and the process begins.

The timing of the whole film if
off; parts which should be slowly
developed are cast upon the audi-
ence like the Devil’s vomit is ex-
plicitly cast upon Father Karras
in the movie. And, as mentioned,
the northern Iraq scene is just
too long.

So the exorcist arrives on the
scene, and the process begins.
“The last time he performed an

But there is a way to make it somewhat easier.
Our way. The Armed Forces Health Professions
Scholarship Program. It won't soften the demands
of your professors, or those you make upon yourself
—but it may free you from those financial problems
which, understandably, can put a crimp in your
concentration.

If you qualify, our scholarship program will cover
the costs of your medical education. More, you'll
receive a good monthly allowance all through your
schooling.

But what happens after you graduate?

Then, as a health care officer in the military
branch of your choice you enter a professional
environment that is challenging, stimulating and
satisfying.

An environment which keeps you in contact with
practically all medical specialties. Which gives you
the time to observe and learn before you decide on
your specialty. Which may present the opportunity
to train in that specialty. And to practice it.

You may also find some of the most advanced
medical achievements happening right where you
work, Like at the Brooke Army Medical Center in
San Antonio, Texas, long noted for its Burn Treat-
ment Center. Or the home of Flight Medicine, the
famed Aerospace Medical Division, also in San

education.” What followea was an
analysis of the Wallace “threat.”
BeeDee could understand the ly-
rics—something like the Star
Spangled Banner, but the music
was coming out all wrong. Lucki-
ly for Barbers’ Dream, this M.

how to tell right from wrong.

“Look, it’s hard to tell how this
whole thing’s gonna evolve. We
won’t want to get TOO political.
But if a lotta people on campus
sai dthey were really into the
Watergate scandal, I think that
would be fine.” Roone Arledge
to Gary Deeb, in T.V. column of
the Chicago Tribune, April 4,
1974.

Henry Sloss didn’t say “I told
you so” to me... he holds out
hope for just about anybody, so
I'm not going to say it to those of
you who didn’t see anything to
get involved over then or now.
Miserable thinking and miserable
acting by people who somehow
have authority is not exclusive to
any country. The same mind that
handled Solzhenitsyn, handled
Watergate, and handled the Sloss
incident. The only difference is
that the people in the Kremlin
and the people in the Executive
Office Building never pretended
to maintain an intellectually di-
verse environment, and W&L
does. All things considered, I’m
sorry to say that I think Nixon is
probably less hypocritical than
the people who “let Henry Sloss
go.” And that, gentlemen, is a
hard act to follow. Happy fourth.

The tennis courts
Sir:

After four vears at this univer-
sity I have finally sat down to
write my first letter to the editor.
This, however, is not really ad-
dressed to the editorial staff of
the Ring-tum Phi. Rather, I am
writing this in hope that our be-
loved Dick Miller or others in
power over the “G-School” will
read it. This concerns the tennis
facilities at Washington and Lee,
or more appropriately the lack
thereof. It is bad enough when
the entire student body and fac-
ulty has to compete for the use of
only six courts. I understand that
this situation is in the process of
being corrected with the new con-
struction. But it is completely ri-
diculous when the courts that are
available are in such deplorable
condition as they are in now.
When one is attempting to play
tennis in the gravel pit they call
tennis courts the game becomes
trying to guess which way the
ball will bounce next. This leaves
a tennis player only one choice—
to try and play at VMI where as
many as three tennis teams play
at times. Why is manpower and
money being expended to tear
down the steps in front of the
gym when something that could
provide some benefit to the W&L
community is being ignored?
Why, Dick Miller, why?

John Russell ’74

Editor’s note: Eight tennis

struction behind the stands at

forms us that they will be ready
in September. He also says there
were hopes to have the courts
ready for the Spring Term, but
weather, an unexpectedly large
large quantity of rock at the site
of the courts, and the slow set-
tlings of the fill underneath the
courts delayed construction.

Pro football comes to Virginia

By BILL AUSTIN

One week ago today, the state
of Virginia gained its first major
league football franchise, a WFL
outfit called the Ambassadors.

Actually, the team had hoped
to share RFK staduim with the
Washington Redskins, but was
blocked in its efforts by the Skins’
monopoly on the lease of the fac-
ijitv. Consequently, mystery-man
owner Joe Wheeler scouted both
Norfolk and Annapolis as possible
sites for his homeless bunch, and
chose the Virginia port city when
his overtures to Annapolis were
received coolly.

Obviously, his decision was not
one made in the heat of ecstasy.
Quite frankly, Wheeler _ still
yearns for Washington, and is
rumored to be biding his time un-
til the enemy Redskins have to
make room for their competition.
Meanwhile, the Ambassadors will
plav in little-used Foreman Field,
a stadium previously doomed to
destruction by 1978, deservedly so.

The park is antiquated: the seat-
ing capacity is a mere 32,000, the
locker rooms are cramped and
grimy. Furthermore, the season
begins in the middle of July, a
time when temperature and hu-
midity chase coastal residents to
the beaches, not to a steamy foot-
ball turf.

When Wheeler visited Norfolk
to survey the town and its inter-
est in his product, he brought
along an aide who passed out 27-
page tracts, entitled “Joe Wheeler:
The Portrait of a Success.”

The blatant pitch for credibility
strikes a posture not unlike that
of Earl] Foreman, owner of the
sinking Virginia Squires. Four
vears of Foreman’s slick opera-
tions have resulted in a disillu-
sioned populace, and a nearly
bankrupt franchise. Charlie Scott,
Julius Erving, Swen Nater’ and
George Gervin have come and
gone to the tune of fat price tags,
as the ABA team became little
more than a farm-team set-up for
the benefit of the league’s wealth-
ter clubs.

Foreman has complained of

Dog unclaimed

A male, light brown great dane
with no tags is currently being
housed at the SPCA animal shel-
ter in Lexington. The owner may
claim the dog at the shelter from
9 a.m. to 12 noon weekdays and
3 to 5 p.m. Sundays. The dog will
be destroyed if it is not claimed
within several days.

apathetic fans in a feeble defense
for his actions. Already, Wheeler
was voiced a similar suspicion in
the placing of his franchise in

Norfolk. Yet it must be maintain-

ed that support for any profes-
sional team must be nurtured, de-
veloped. Foreman promised a
champion, then unloaded his tal-
ent to cover personal debts.
Wheeler expresses the same grand
hope for a solid outfit, yet cloaks

the facts of his financial strength
in cliches and gaudy pamphlets.
Major jeague sport could make a
profitable go of things in Virginia.

That added ending is as needed as

of course.

After edging Hampden-Sydney
in a game played the final Thurs-
day before exams, the baseball
Generals put their 5-0 won-lost
mark to a formidable test in em-
barking on a spring-time odyssey
into North Carolina.

Plagued by rain and by less
than ideal accommodations,
W&L’s bunch found life no easier
on the playing field. Defeats were
administered (and how!) by the
likes of Fayettevile, St. Augustine,
Cambell and Pembroke Colleges.
These schools may not be familiar
names to most, but they play
baseball with a skill borne of
much practice and dedication. For
the W&L team, a group stil in
the process of learning the sport,
the contests were rude reminders

turned to familiar Lexington, the

club Jost its sixth game in succes-
sion, this time to VMI.

The fifth General victory was
pitched by Rod Ferrandino, as
he picked up his third complete-
game win of the season. A com-
rortable 5-1 lead was threatened
by three Tiger tallies in the 8th
inning, and again by a 9th-inning
uprising in which H-S placed the
go-ahead run on hase. Yet, Fer-
randino held off the awakened
enemy bats and the Generals fin-
ished March in fine style.

The junior moundsman also
pitched the first game of the road
trip against Fayetteville, and for
the first time this season failed to
go the full route. Coach Lyles re-
moved him in the 7th, when Fay-
etteville hitters had tagged his
stuff for 10 hits and a 7-1 lead.
Designated hitter Bob Rathbun
homered for the lone W&L score.
To be sure, five regulars missed
contest due to exams, and the en-
tire team was hurt by the study-
time layoff. The 11-1 score could
have been much closer.

Such speculation would be fool-
ish concerning the games that fol-
lowed. Four General pitchers (in-
cluding Al Burton, normally a
catcher) failed to calm explosive
St. Augustine bats. Freshman

Maynard McCorkle was the pitch-
ing-victim of a grand slam homer.

Cambell College, the Generals
took 1-0 leads in each of the two
games, then received poundings
in both. Dan Westbrook lost in
the opener; Bob Rathbun dropped
the nightcap in his college pitch-
ing debut. Finally, Ferrandino
was again belted in an 8-0 loss to
powerful Pembroke College.

Foul weather forced the can-
celjation of a second game against
St. Augustine, and washed out a
meeting with North Carolina
State. Notably, Don Hathway com-
piled a 9-game hitting streak (he
missed the Fayetteville contest).

Hathway's hitting stopped at
VMI, but not the General losing
skein. Tuesday’s game was de-
eided in the first inning, when
Keydet batters jumped on Dan
Westbrook for four quick seores.

Track, tennis
squads win

The Wé&L tennis and _ track
squads had successful spring va-
cations, with Coach Tom Davies’
tennis squad defeating Emory U.
5-4, Towson 8-1, Eckerd 8-1 and
St. L - 9-0 to up its season record
to 7-2. The netters lost matches to
F lorida 9-0 and Southern Florida
&-].

Coach Norris Aldridge’s track
sguad bombed Wofford and Gard-
ned-Webb to up its record to 3-2.

The tennis team has a very
busy schedule for the next week,
including playing at home Friday
against one of the best college
teams in the state, Hampton In-
stitute. The match will begin at
2 p.m. on the W&L courts under
the footbridge.

Other home contests include a
junior varsity lacrosse match
Thursday against VMI, beginning
at 3 p.m. on the W&L practice

field.

City, county tags
must be bought

Ali students who have motor ve-
hicles at Washington and Lee are
‘eminded that they were requir-
ed to purchase new local tags by
April 15, 1974.

A student whose local address
is within the city limits of Lex-
ington is required to purchase a
decal from the City Treasurer’s
Office at the Lexington City Hall
on East Washington Street. A
whose local resiednce is

registration papers

Though they trailed throughout,
the Generals kept things close by
mustering 11 hits off VMI fresh-
man Tom Mihalik. Westbrook
pitched seven innings, surrender-
ing six runs on nine hits. His per-
formance was hurt by the rather
unsteady play of his infielders, as
four errors were committed, each
seemingly at a critical time in the
struggle.

The 9th inning all too graph
ally typified the contest. With one
run in and Rice and Hathway on
first and third, cleanup hitter Al
Burton drilled a shot down the
third base line. VMI thirdbaseman
Donnie Ross dove to his right and
snagged the ball on one hop. He
staggered to his feet and threw
Burton out by a step, thus pre-
serving a 6-3 Keydet triumph.
