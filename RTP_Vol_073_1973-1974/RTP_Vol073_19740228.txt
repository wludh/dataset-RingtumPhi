bright blue paint last weekend,

 

 

 

 

 

Dr. Henry Stoutte Roberts,
professor of biology and de-
partment head at Washington
and Lee, died last Thursday
in a Roanoke hospital. He was
60. Funeral services were held
Saturday.

Dr. Roberts was a _ widely
known authority in the field

of cytokinesis, the changes
which occur in protoplasm

during cell division.

He joined Washington and
Lee’s faculty in 1964, after 18
vears at Duke University. At
the time he left Duke for W&L
he was director of graduate
studies in zoology.

He is survived by his wife,
\nne Houle Roberts, whom he
married in 1943, and by two
sons, Henry S. Roberts III of
Seattle and Frederick E. Rob-

erts, a graduate student in di-
vinity at Duke.

As biology head he reorgan-
ized the department’s course
offerings substantially. The
vear he arrived at W&L, the
department offered 16 courses;
it now offers 28, including an
innovative series of six short
advanced seminars. He also
developed an arrangement
with Duke’s Marine Labora-
tory to permit W&L biology
and chemistry students to
study marine science there
during the spring term.

He was graduated with hon-
ors from Mercer University
and received the Ph.D. in
zoology from Duke,

Dr. Roberts was an enthusi-
astic and exacting but highly
popular teacher at W&L.

 

 

 

Who painted
old George?

By JESS REEVES

The statue of George atop
Washington Hall was painted
bright blue on Saturday night
of Faney Dress Weekend. The
culprits are currently still at
large, but the names of four
probable suspects have been
given to the Student Control Com-
mittee. A night watchman caught
the students at one point but they
escaped.

According to President Hunt-
ley this job compares favorably
to past ones. The last time the
statue Was painted was in 1958
and President Huntley feels that
once every 16 years is probably
2snough,

The authorities only have a
vague idea of how the feat was
accomplished. Those responsible
might have entered Robinson
Hall and gone to the tthird floor
to reach the roof. Once on top
of Washington Hall a ladder with
a center extension could have

been used to allow one person
to climb up to the staute.
When the statue was first

erected in the early 1840’s stu-
dents made a habit of painting
it. Until 1937 the statue could be
reached from the inside of Wash-
ington Hall which made the stunt
somewhat easier than it is to-
day. Traditionally the statue was
painted bright blue by the fresh.

men, VMI cadets also liked to
paint George and usually used
their school clolors, red and yel-

low,

In 1949, when the statue was
finally scraped, the chips came
off in layers an inch and a
quarter thick. Estimates of ths
number of coats of paint run as
high as 125 layers or more.

This year Fancy Dress was
reinstated with much of tka
glamour of yesteryear. Some

traditions of the school returned
for the weekend, just long enough:
for someone to paint old George

Petitions due Monday
for top EC offices

By ROBERT PUGH

Elections for student body
president, vice-president, and
secretary are scheduled for Mon-
day, March 11.

All candidates desiring their
names on the ballot should sub-
mit petitions with 150 signa-
tures to the EC box by mid-
night, Monday, March 4, All
candidates should be at the EC
meeting 6:30 p.m. Monday and
should have an article of no
more than 250 words for the
newspaper by Tuesday noon in
the EC box.

There will be a general as:
sembly Thursday, March 7, at 7
p.m. with speeches and a ques:
tion and answer session by the
various candidates, all of whom
are expected to attend.

Student Activities Board Chair-
man Mike Brittin announced that
1,700 people attended Fancy
Dress. He considered the affair
a great success.

The EC discussed the Faculty
Ad Hoe Committee on Discipline
report. The report proposes aboli-
tion of the Student Affairs Com-
and establishment of a
subcommittee of the University
Council to handle appeals from

nittee

the Student Control Committee
and the Interfraternity Council.
Concern was expressed at the
meeting about the dissolution of
SAC and the method of selecting
student members for the appeals
board. The report calls for ap-
pointment by the entire UC of
the three student and two faculty
members.

Curriculum Committee Chair-
man Herbie Rubenstein brought
his committee’s revised curricu-
lwm survey back to the EC,
which endorsed it. If the faculty
approves, 10 minutes of class
time Wednesday, March 13, and
Thursday, March 14, will be de-
voted to answering the survey.

In other business, the EC en-
dorsed plans for a one day ex-
tension of the spring break and
appointed junior Jack Parks to
the Library Committee,

Changing t
anging the spring break

The University Council, charged with maintenance of the school
calendar, meets today at 7:30 p.m. in the Executive Committee room
of the University Center.

One issue scheduled to come before that body today is the pos-
sible change of the dates of the spring break. Specifically, classes
are scheduled to begin Monday, April 15, which means students
will be coming back on Sunday, April 14, (which, by the way, is
Easter Sunday, to whom it may concern).

The arguments for a change in the schedule this time are much
stronger than they were for the winter break two weeks ago. And
the arguments to keep the schedule unchanged are much weaker.

First and foremost is the gasoline shortage. It’s getting more
and more difficult to buy gas on Sundays, or on any day, for that
matter. Fewer and fewer stations are staying open on Sundays.

Anyone living more than a gas tank away just isn’t going to make
ti back here on a Sunday. And by April 14, shutting down service
stations may not just be voluntary any longer. Consider, too, that
April 14 is a holiday.

Also, one problem that existed when the UC considered chang-
ing the winter break is not a factor at this time. In all likelihood,
nobody has as yet made his spring break “plans” as far as buying
plane tickets and other travel paraphernalia are concerned. Thus, a
change in the schedule now would not stand to ruin anyone’s vaca-
tion plans at this time.

Furthermore, the problem with labs with which Dean Watt so
superbly confused and stifled the rest of the UC in discussing a
winter break change doesn’t hamper a change in the spring break.
We won’t go into details explain the lab problems which were in-
volved with the winter br&ik. We will, however, venture to guess
that such “problems” could be averted after the spring break by
either doubling up classes on one day or by holding classes on one
Saturday.

Indeed, there is but one problem involved with changing the
spring break schedule, and that is getting the UC to be responsive
to student needs. We suggest to those interested that they attend
the meeting today, that they let he UC know what they want.

Fancy Dress lives again

Much like the phoenix out of the ashes, Fancy Dress was reborn
out of faded memories of the past last weekend as good times re-
urned to Washington and Lee.

From the Emerald City Saloon to the dumping of a pitcher of
beer on University President Robert Huntley, the affair was, well,
memorable, to say the least. But to be a bit more descriptive, it
was the biggest event to hit this campus in years.

Need more be said? —P.J.L.

Hiring a lawyer for the students

Despite what one may read in this column almost weekly, the
Executive Committee is not always a target worthy of the Phi’s inky
59ison barbs. In fact, the EC, Washington and Lee’s answer to the
Dirty Dozen, sometimes can come up with a brilliant idea or two.

One of those ideas is the hiring of a lawyer to provide legal
advice for students and student organizations. The EC is currently
discussing the possibility of hiring such a lawyer to be paid for
with student body funds.

The plan, if adopted, would not go into effect until next year.
And the lawyer could only advise; after the advice, a student would
have to go out and hire his own lawyer. .

The possibilities are almost limitless. Students would particularly
benefit in such areas as obtaining advice about civil suits, traffic
violations, and even drug laws. And student organizations, too, could
benefit from a little legal advice when needed.

We hope the EC carries through this idea as far as it is able.
The students have a psychologist and a psychiatrist for advice of
the mind; they have doctors available for advice of the body; there’s
even a university chaplain for advice of the spirit. Why not, then,
-lawver for advice of the societal man?

Ask Traveller

Q—I think you are a pervert. Why don’t vou stuff your stupid advice
column in your mouth and shove your head into a Hefty bag?

 

A—Are you kidding? You must think I’m perverted or something.

Listen, intolerant ideas like yours downgrade everything
decent and fair, not only in this country but at most participat-
ing Gulf dealers as well. No wonder they don’t give away those
cute beachballs anymore.

Historically, it was just this sort of fanatical hatred that led
to the witch-burning in Salem, even though Cotton Mather had
said they were too green and that the weanies would brown
quicker with just ordinary twigs and a little kerosene.

The Bible contains dozens of clear examples of your narrow-
mindedness and deceit: Lot asking his wife to pass the salt; Moses
posing as an Egyptian life-guard at the Red Sea Beach; Herod
signing the first bonus baby in spring training; St. Paul’s mother
forcing him to endorse her fish-sticks on radio.

Believe me, you're not the first student to question my advice
yy give naughty threats of reprisal for taking it. Why, just last
week, a voice over the telephone said that if I ever hoped to
see $50,000 again (as if I’ve ever seen $50,000 to begin with),
I'd better put my roommate in a brown paper bag and drop him
ff the footbridge at midnight...and no cops, or else, the voice
said it would spend all the money on pantyhose in Leggett’s
lingerie department. And at the Pavilion over Fancy Dress week-
end, I was forced to masquerade as a goat skin full of grain
punch because two Delts said if they caught me there they’d wrap
a Maryland license plate around my head and throw me in the
crease... whatever that meant. And if that wasn’t enough, some
sillv girl from Madrid kept tipping my head back and shouting:
“Vino from the old country.”

But I refuse to be intimidated by obscene minds, no matter
how much I admire them. The pen is mightier than the sword,
and so are six Yale locks on my apartment front door, disguised
as mailmen. I dare the most vile thug on campus to shake my
courage—or my hand, for that matter. Thank goodness this
column’s anonymous, even if I’m not Palmer Trice.

Q—Why don’t you pack up and leave town, you pervert?

A—I would but I can’t see with this Hefty bag over my head.

Duties of EC president outlined

With petitions due for Execu-
tive Committee positions next
Monday, the Ring-tum Phi pre-
sents letters from three know-
ledgeable sources (a university
president, a dean of students,
and a former EC president) on
the duties of the Executive
Committee and of the student
body president. Besides Lawr-
ence, three other past and pres-
ent EC presidents — Doug
Schwartz, Bob Brennan, Steve
Robinson — submitted letters
which we are unable to run
due to lack of space.

President Huntley

It has traditionally been true at
Washington and Lee that a large
measure of responsibility is dele-
gated to student government. The
position of a student body officer
has thus always been a busy and
important one. However, my own
observation is that in recent years
the duties and_ responsibilities
have increased.

This increase is attributable to
several factors, some formal or
organizational and some informal.
Many of these formal factors
have come into being in recent
vears. For example, students serve
on at least eight standing com-
mittees whic ha decade ago were
entirely faculty or administration
committees. In addition, there are
several important all-student com-
mittees which have come about
in the last ten years, such as the
Student Control Committee, the
Student Activities Board, the Stu-
dent Recruitment Committee, and
the Student Curriculum Commit-
tee. And, of course, the Univer-
sity Council was created three
vear's ago and has become an im-
portant part of University gov-
ernance,

The Student Body Executive
Committee, and student body
officers, and especially the EC
president are expected not only
to play a role in appointing many
of the student representatives on
these committees but also in
maintaining close communication
and familiarity with their work.
1 and other administrators and
faculty members rely heavily on

the elected student body repre-
sentatives—and, again, particul-
arly the EC present for student
information.

The EC president has specific
duties which alone consume much
of his time and energy. He, of
course, presides at weekly EC
meetings and co-chairs monthly
meetings of the University Coun-
cil. In addition, he attends twice
monthly meetings of the Student
Affairs Committee. Three times a
year he participates in meetings
of the University Board of Trus-
tees. He also assists and takes
part in such programs as fresh-
man orientation and _ Parents’
Weekend. And these are only a
few examples.

The administration of the
Honor System falls entirely on
the EC and is its single most im-
portant function. The Honor Sys-
tem must require many days of
time each year for every member
of the committee. Again, the EC
president presides and plays a
major role.

To all this must be added the
responsibility of remaining “in
touch” with the student body
and with the administration and
faculty in more informal ways. In
my opinion this responsibility is
second in importance only to the
administration of the Honor Sys-
tem, because without it the other
more formal duties become mere
hollow routine,

R.E.R.H.

Fran Lawrence

My immediate predecessor as
Executive Committee president
demonstrated that a person can
be both a distinguished scholar
and an excellent student leader.
A well-motivated person can do
a good job both as student and
student body president and learn
a great deal in the experience.
I would argue, however, that it
can be an equally fulfilling and
perhaps more interesting experi-
ence for the less motivated stu-
dent.

There are a great many activi-
ties requiring the time and energy
of the student body president,
some more important than others.

WEL to offer course in

By JESS REEVES

At the last faculty meeting sev-
eal courses were approved by
the faculty as additions to the
curriculum, Some appear promis-
ing, some, scholarly, and some,
ridiculous.

Elementary and
Japanese will be offered next
vear. One can easily see the
validity of such courses. The his-
tory department has come up
with a worthwhile course in “The
Papacy since the Schism.” But,
the art department suggested a
course titled “Introduction to
Crafts.”

intermediate

The description of this offer-
ing which the faculty approved
is as follows: Technique and skills
in glass blowing, ceramics, metal
smithing and leather smithing.
One may regret that the art de-
partment did not suggest a course
in basket weaving for the faculty
to bless. At least that would
have potential value for the stu-

dent fated to become blind in
later years.
If hobbies are to become

courses of study at Washington
and Lee then mechanics should
also be included in the curri-
culum. Then one interested in

Largely, there are meetings, and
more meetings. But the real ex-
citement is the unlimited number
of meaningful, slightly less mean-
ingful, and practically meaning-
less pursuits a person can attach
himself to under the guise of
student body president.

In addition to handling the im-
portant and rewarding functions
of the Honor System and admini-
stration of student activities,
there are limitless other roles a
person can undertake. With a
little imagination, a person can
view himself as chief negotiator
between town and gown, as good-
will ambassador, as hustler, pro-
moter, and general handyman, in
addition to serving as director of
the board and defender of the
faith. Activities can be conjured
up to fill almost every waking
hour.

This seems to me one of the
jovs of being student body presi-
dent. It is, however, one of the
pitfalls as well. The rude awaken-
ing comes when the faculty re-
ports on your academic progress.
Hopefully, you have saved for a
rainy day. And, happily, spring
rolls around and you are a lame
duck, paddling around Indian
Hole sipping a cold beer.

As a last gesture, you can pull
vour short term grade up to a
commendable average, and, after
making a few terse and witty
comments at graduation, vou slip
into oblivion. All in all, a grand
experience.

Dean John

Since 1963 when I first return-
ed to Washington and Lee, and
especially since 1969 when I
began working closely with the
Executive Committee in my Ca-
pocity as Dean of Students, the
duties and responsibilities assum-
ed by student government on this
campus have increased signific-
antly. Any student who is con-
sidering entry into the field for
an EC position should be fully
aware of these heavy responsibili-
ties and the concomitant demands
which will be made upon his time;
these demands often interfere
both with his academic course

work and with his “down-the-

road” social schedule.

Two areas deserve specific men:
tion. Responsibilities for Honor
System policy and administration
remain paramount. The student
body as a whole sees only the
“tip of the iceberg” involving
vearly evaluation of overall
Honor System effectiveness and.
occasional notices on the ODK
board concerning students who
have been found guilty of specific
violations. Also important and
extremely time-consuming are the
much more frequent investiga-
tions of possible violations report-
ed to the EC, preliminary hear-
ings, and the EC trials them-
selves, only a small percentage
of which result in convictions.

The trend in the past five years
which has been most noticeable
and striking to me has been the
more active and effective involve-
ment of the EC in matters of
general University interest and.
policy. Prominent this year have
been EC considerations of the
fine arts, expanded programs of
student activities, and student
health services. In addition, the
EC carries out much of this in-
volvement through the appoint-
ment and supervision of a num-
ber of all-student committees, as
well as the recommendation of
students to serve on standing Uni-
versity committees, as discussed
by President Huntley elsewhere
in this issue.

The position of EC president is
a particularly responsible demand-
ing, and time-consuming job. Not
only must he do everything other
EC members are expected to do,
but he carries many additional
responsibilities (See President
Huntley’s letter).

A pressing need for the new
EC, in my opinion, will be to
explore various alternatives for
delegation of some of the presi-
dential responsibilities to other
EC members in an attempt to
lighten his extremely heavy load,
but whatever is done can result
in only a marginal reduction in
the demands on his time and
energies. The position by its very
nature is one that involves an
extraordinary degree of personal
sacrifice. L.G.J.

arts and crafts

vocational and technical training
could get a degree from W&L
which would suit him to a posi-
tion as a grease monkey in
Goshen, Virginia.

By next spring the results of
the approval of this course should
be readily apparent. Coeds will
be able to stroll across campus
with their beaded handbags fresh
out of the workroom of duPont.
Others will be able to proudly
wear belts stamped with their
initials that they made a special!
project for Art 216.

The argument might be ad-
vanced that the minor arts were

among the finest in ancient
Greece. Hopefully, a W&L gradu-

ate will not have spent his
educational career preoccupied
with minor topics. There are

more valuable ways for students
to spend the small amount of
time alloted them at this uni-
versity than making crude
ceramic vases.

Eclectic electric

By W. PATRICK HINELY

Fearless

United Artists UAS-5562
Bandstand

United Artists UAS-5644
It’s Only a Movie
United Artists UA-LA181-F

The recently announced dis-
banding of the English band
“Family” proves beyond the
shadow of a doubt that good
things don’t last forever. Though
their passing is not quite of the
magnitude of the Beatles break-
ing up, it is worth noting, for
the lyrics and music of Family
would easily outdo the work of
the Beatles, collectively or indi-
vidually, hands down to anyone
but the most simple-minded list-
ener.

The best way I can think of
to put it is that the Beatles had
depth to their work, but hid it
under a candy-coating for AM
radio. Family, on the other hand,
wore their frustrations and more
complex feelings of joy on their
sleeves, as it were. And their
music is infinitely more interest-
ing, requiring more than passing
attention to derive the full en-
jovment of listening to it.

Though they were big-time in
England, on an equal par with
the Stones or the Who, Family
never quite broke big in the U.S.
They were never given much
promotion, and some kind of per-
sonal conflicts with Bill Graham
on their first U.S. tour didn’t help
much, either. They have several
albums older than the three I’m
dealing with in this review, but
some are out of print, and others
were never released in the States.

What we do have, though, in
these three are Family’s strong-
est works. The writing team of
Roger Chapman, vocalist, and
Charlie Whitney, guitarist, is re-
markably versatile within a basic
rock game. They write in a some-
what literary style, ranging from
stream-of consciousness impres-
sions of some given moment, as
in “Coronation” on Bandstand to
a carefully woven story like
“Buffet Tea for Two” on the
Movie album.

They also have an extremely
powerful ability to bust someone
right in the gut, no holds barred,
like in “Ready to Go,” from Band-
stand. The often boring high
volume electric techniques of
rock’n’raunch are used artfully to
reinforce the lyrics. Whitney was
experimenting with licks on the
twin-neck while McLaughlin was
just getting his Mahavishnu
Orchestra together. The music
and the words fit together in a
kind of yin-yang relationship,
especially on songs like “Broken
Nose,” another masterpiece from
Bandstand, What they did, basi-
cally, was to expand on a style of
writing started by Dylan through
sophisticating the music and
simplifying the onslaught of
lvries, as with:

I see her everyday now

And boy has she got Class

She got diamonds on her
fingers

And rhythm in her ass.
That’s fairly direct.

Family could also do the quiet
acoustic folky kind of thing, too.
The Dead try it, but they don’t
have the voices to do the singing,
and their music is kid’s stuff
compared to the things Family
sets up and works around. Of
course, Family also makes much
more use of the possibilities of a
studio, tastefully placing mello-
tron and moog spurts here and
there. Something like “Bolero
Babe” (also from Bandstand)
could never be the same live, but
it sure sounds nice on the stereo.
Their use of electronics is a
logical progression from the pio-
neering work of the Beatles on
Sargeant Pepper.

The Whitney-Chapman team
wrote most of the songs, but
kevboard-vibraphone man _ Poli
Palmer did some nice stuff, too.
He was definitely the existential-
ist of the band, or rather the
most pronounced one, as in “Larf
and Sing” from Fearliess:

Everything about me has a face

A purposeless existence

overgrown

Whoever would have thought

amongst our mighty race

A man could feel so terribly

alone.
And yet they never leave you
hanging over the void as some
bands tend to do; there is defi-
nite awereness of rolling with the
punches, as in the conclusion of
the song:

Losing sometimes mean you win

If vou let the true you through

You will always find us in

If vou keep your seed in view

Drink, old mother life, she’s

the only kin we got.

As musicians, the band has
distinct elments of rock, folk, and
jazz, though not necessarily in
that order; it varies from song to
song. A constant treat are their
often too short instrumentals,
which must have been dynamite
in concert when they felt like
stretching them out. Each one is
built around a central possibilities
the various jamming possibilities
only hinted at briefly. Being
more inclined toward §instru-
mental music myself, I tend to
look at the shortness of these
pieces as an indication that they
were more concerned with word-
songs than with creating tight,
concise music, though they defi-
nitely had the ability to do both
equally well. And, god, could that
Poli Palmer play vibes! “Crinkly
Grin,” from Fearless, in 65 sec-
onds of pure musical energy.

The main drawback to Family’s
albums is the recording. Some-
thing just gets lost in the mix,
giving the whole sound a sort
of subdued, mildly surreal qual-
itl. It sounds better loud. George
Chkiantz, their producer, who al-
so produced several Soft Machine
albums, Manages to mix every-
thing together so that the sum
is not greater than the parts
taken individually. If the words

-Inside-Out

By ROME SCOTT
Entertainment Editor

Badfinger—a bad name for a worse group. Heading the bill of
a concert at Virginia Tech’s coliseum Saturday night, the four-man
band inspired by, modeled after and nurtured by the Beatles should
put on a hackneved show at best.

Promoted by Paul McCartney and produced in part by George
Harrison, Badfinger has had one of the best chances possible ia
the music business to hit it big,

Even with this background the group has had only sporadic and
mild success.

Badfinger’s initial jaunt before the public came with a Me-
Cartney-written song “Come And Get It” released on the sound
track album for the Ringo Starr movie “The Magic Christian.”

The music was a shallow sounding attempt to appeal to t
teenage, top-40 radio public and gained many hours of air play cr
the strength of McCartney’s reputation alone.

With the release of “Day After Day” Badfinger finally made Bi!!-
board’s top-100 rating on its own, meaning the group wrote the song.
George Harrison produced the record and manufactured the weepy
slide guitar so characteristic of Harrison’s own music.

Up to this point the band reflected the Beatle’s influence with
vocals made up of Lennon-esque harmony structure and McCartney-
like, plaintive love-lyrics.

The vocals were backed by a simple, rhythmic instrumental bacl:-
ground textured to the raw, gutsy flavor of early Beatles.

It was “Love Me Do” all over again with one difference—Ba3-
finger is not the Beatles.

The band’s attempt to recapture the feeling of the old Beatle styic
couldn’t match the listeners’ memory of it.

A feeling for the style was not enough. To sound like the Beati-s
and wet away with it, vou have to be the Beatles and the public let
the group know it.

After a time of re-vamping Badfinger came back into the public
eve with a slightly harder, rock and roll-oriented sound releasing
“No Matter What You Are” and “Baby Blue.”

The new sound shows little personality and the vocals still have
a tendency to remind the listener of the Beatles just enough to }:2
annoying.

All told, Badfinger comes out sounding like a tasteless Beatles with
a rinky-tinky rock musical backdrop.

However, this judgment is based solely on the group’s studio
sound and, live, Badfinger may produce a sound worth hearing.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Psychiatric care available

By DARRYL CARLTON

Washington and Lee provides
help for the student with emo-
tional difficulties in the persons
of a university psychiatrist and a
university psychologist. Both of
these offer free services to stu-

dents and other member of the
W&L community.
There is often a lot of con-

fusion here about the difference
between the two. The psychiatrist
has a medical degree and can dis-
pense drugs, while a psychologist
usually has a Ph.D. or Ed.D. de-
gree. (See last week’s Phi for a
story on the university psycholog-
ist, Dr. James Worth.)

W&L began its mental health
services with a psychiatrist, Dr.
Terry Wingfield, who is a mem-
ber of the American Psychologi-
cal Association. He received his
medical degree from Duke Uni-
versity and specialized in psychi-
atry at the University of Virginia
Medical School.

In the early sixties, the uni-
versity became aware that there
was a student need for mental
health services. Dr. Wingfield ex-
plained that he was approached
by Dean Atwood, Dean Sprunt,
and Dr. Cole (then president of
the university) for his advice on
the matter. “I had been doing

and music weren’t so obviously

powerful, the sound wouldn't
come through.
The final album, It’s Only a

Movie, is intricately constructed
as a final musica] statement. Per-
sonnel changes affected’ the
music,, keeping it in the vein of
both earlier works. The lyrics
are just as powerful, but little
musical progress comes through.
Maybe they did it on purpose,
maybe they had nowhere left to
go, or maybe they just had a
contract to finish out. Even with
these adversities, the album
stands at least one cut above
73 per cent of the pap presently
being pressed onto vinyl by
people that record company busi-
nessmen tell us through their
slick promotion departments are
“musical artists.”

If you Jisten to music as hack-
ground noise, these records won’t

sound any better than most
others. On the other hand, if you
listen to your records, these will
give much enjoyment, provoke
some thinking, perhaps sometimes
a bit alarming, and will stand
up well to repeated listening.
Many American rock critics,

mostly the ones who have direct
or indirect influence over what
played on radio, tend to
write Family off as just another
English band, Some, though, have
recognized the uniqueness of
their style and deal with their
work as it should be dealt with.
Of course, that doesn’t make hits.
Not that it’s bothering Family;
as they said in “Ready to Go,”
on Bandstand:

And I’ve served me some time

And I’m ready to go.
Alas, they are gone.

health) work at Ran-
Sweetbriar, and
he explain-

(mental!

Lynchburg colleges”
ed.

He divided the reasons why
W&L chose to employ a psychia-
trist at that time in three ways.
“50% was brought on by emerg-
ency or crisis problems, which
were handled in a_ haphazard
manner. It was difficult to get
psychiatric help. 25% came from
the university’s attitude, its de-
sire to assist the students in their
needs, and 25% came from the
university’s desire for growth and
development.”

Dr. Wingfield began his pro-
gram in 1965. He comes to the
Wé&L campus once a week, on
Monday, and to other area col-
leges three of the other days. He
also has a part-time private prac-
tice in Lynchburg, and works
with the Virginia Baptist Hospital
on a limited scale.

“Getting a sensible program
started went faster here than at
some of the other schools,” he
commented, “Students seemed to
accept a psychologist with less
paranoia and suspicion.”

When asked about his techni-
que, he explained that this in-
volves “whatever way I can be
of most help to the students.”
This may involve asking a lot of
questions if he feels the student
needs to talk, or giving advice
“if the student genuinely wants
it.” He also said that he did some
psychotherapy, attempting to pro-
vide corrective experiences for
those with real emotional dis-
orders.

Another part of his job is
“screening,” or making evalua-
tions and referral to private
psychiatrists and clinics. Finally,
he stated that he was doing what
he called, ‘pseudo-research” into
particular kinds of growth and
emotional problems in a univer-
sity.

Dr. Wingfield uses drugs in his
program “increasingly” as time
goes on. “There has been a tre-
mendous improvement in drug
therapy in recent years” he ex-
plained. This has included the
development of anti-depressant
and anti-psychotic drugs, as well
as of safe tranquillizers. When
asked about the use of illicit

drugs on campus, he comment-
ed, “It is my hunch that, although
students are not coming to see
me as frequently about it, drug
use on Campus remains at a high
level.” He explained that this
could be because of a “famili-
arity” with drugs which leads to
fewer unstable reactions with
them.

When asked in what areas he
thought his office could be especi-
ally helpful, he commented “I
am really concerned with the
three suicides we’ve had here in
just three years.” He said that
this was much higher than the
expected statistical average for a
university of this size.

“Suicide and depression are
closely related,” he continued.
“Depression is a disorder or ill-
ness and not just pathos, apathy
or despondency.” He said that
these were only symptoms of
depression.

He concluded, “We have the
capacity to make a real differ-
ence here and ways to help.” Dr.
Wingfield’s office is located on
the second floor of the Student
Center, Room 103. There is a
sign-up sheet on the door on
which people put their initials

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

By BILL FLESHER

There was a time back in
January when a bunch of guys
who play basketball for Wash-
ington and Lee University could
have rolled over and played dead
for the rest of their 1973-74 sea-
son.

They were on their way home
from Towson State College, where
thev had lost their seventh game
in nine outings. For the fifth
time, the margin of defeat was
less than three points—this time
a mere ont point separted the
Generals from victory. There
really wasn’t much left to plav
for—the crowds had dwindled to
the same group of fans game in,
game out; any chances for post-
season play were gone. The only
thing left to play for was pride.

Monday night that same bunch
of guys headed home from Hamp-
den-Sydney, having done what
only they thought could be done
—pulling out another winning
season.

They did itbyplaying gutsy bas-
ketball game after game. They
got the breaks in the waning mo-
ments of the close ones and pick-
ed up wins instead of losses.
Most of all, they never gave up,
and, in the end, were reworded
for both their persistence and
their efforts.

They did it by playing gutsy
basketball game after game. They
final 15 games. And, when you
consider that among those op-
ponents were nationally ranked
teams Old Dominion and _ Roa-
noke, and state small college
powers Madison and Randolph-
Macon, the task was by no means
an easy one.

From 2-7 to 13-11. Think about
it.

% a ae

Verne Canfield’s forces entered
the final week of the season one
game below .500, knowing full
well that only three wins in three
games could give Canfield his
eighth straight winning season.
Win number 11 came far from
home—in Johnstown,
vania to be exact.

The Generals’ foe was the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh at Johns-

town, or, as they’re known to
Johnstonians, UPJ. Canfield knew
W&L would be in for a tough
ball game, even though the Panth-
ers’ 5-17 record didn’t indicate it.

Four of UPJ’s wins had come
on their home court, of which
“matchbox-sized” would be a most
appropriate description. The
architects of the gym didn’t allow
for players running more than
four feet past both endlines,
which will usually cause the fast-
breaking team to slow down out
of fear of running into walls at
full speed.

Just that happened to W&L in
the early going. Unable to get
their fast break going, W&L fell
behind by as many as 10 points
midway through the first half.

Then W&L’s aggressive man-to-
man defense again took its toll
on the opposition. The Panthers
began making careless mistakes,
and the Generals began to run
and score. W&L outscored UPJ
26-10 in the last nine minutes of
the first half, and took a 39-31
lead to the locker room at half-
time.

W&L managed to hold the lead
the better part of the second
half, although UPJ kept drawing
closer and closer. The Panthers
finally tied it up at 56-56 with
8:20 left. Yet, UPJ could never
pull into the lead.

The score was again tied, 64-
64, with 4:49 to play. Then the
Generals took control at both
ends. Greg Croghan and _ Skip
Lichtfuss manned the _ boards,
while everyone did their job in
getting the ball in the can. W&L
outscored UPJ 15-8 down the
stretch to win, 79-72.

Sophomore- guard Pual
Podgajny led all scorers with 22
points. Although he didn’t en-
joy a super’ shooting night,
Lichtfuss still played well, add-
ing 16 points, pulling down 11
rebounds, and tying a school rec-
ord with 10 assists.

The game proved a costly one
as sophomore playmaker Paul
Maloney suffered a knee injury,
and was lost to the team for their

final two games.

Wa&L basketball team finishes 13-11

The season home finals pro-
duced win number 12 and a lot
of gray hairs.

Grove City College came to
Doremus Gym with another one
of those not-too-convincing season
slates. Though 9-14, they had
proved their talents the night be-
fore when, after an eight hour
bus trip, they fell to Madison
College by only eight points in
Harrisonburg.

The Generals once again looked
as if they forgot the first 20
minutes counted just as much as
the last 20. Sloppy play dominat-
ed in the first half, and only good
defense gave the Generals a 30-30
halftime deadlock.

Then Skip Lichtfuss took over.
The senior captain, playing his
final home game, poured in 19
points in the second half. An 18-
footer with 12:37 left enabled
him to pass Lee Marshall for
fifth place on the all-time scor-
ing list at W&L. Yet the record
almost became meaningless
thanks to the efforts of Grove
City’s Jim Perrequet.

Perrequet kept his team in the
game with one of the most scintil-
lating shooting performances seen
this year. His 34 points included
two key baskets and a pair of
free throws that sent the game
into overtime (the Generals held
the ball for a final shot, but were
unable to get one off).

The overtime saw the return
of the “big gook” and the change
of the “Mad Bomber.”

Six-eight soph Norm Kristoff,
who hadn’t seen much action in
recent weeks due to an ankle
injury, exerted his influence in
the overtime to score six points
and grab five rebounds. He also
blocked two shots in the extra
period which had the crowd on
their feet.

As for W&L’s “Mad Bomber,”
one would have forgotten by now
that Bowman Williams knew
what a drive was. Having seen
his 25-foot or better rockets al!
year, who would have thought
two buckets on drives by Wil-
liams would have played a big
a role as his moves in Saturday’s
overtime,

But the big basket was saved
for the guest ce honor, as it
should have been. Lichtfuss, who
along with guard Jerry Porath
was honored at halftime, got the
ball for the final shot with :09
left. Lichtfuss dribbled to the
foul line, then threw up a shot
from about 17 feet out. The ball
hit off the back of the rim, bounc-
ed toward the rafters and fell
through without moving the net.
The seniors went out as they
should—77-75 victors.

Lichtiuss finished with 27
points while Williams and Krist-
off chipped in with 14 and 12
each. Kristoff pulled down 10
rebounds, one behind Greg
Croghan’s 11 grabs.

Then came the BIG one—the
game that mean teither a win-
ning or a .500 season.

Monday night’s Hampden-Syd-

ney clash was a makeup of the
Feb. 16 game which was can-
celled due to icy roads.
The Generals came out smokin’,
doing everything that any coach
would love to see. For the first
20 minutes W&L showed that
they were indeed one of Vir-
ginia’s best small college teams,
never mind their record.

Their aggressive man-to-man
defense forced the Tigers into
hurried shots from far out. Once
they got the ball off the boards,
the Generals gave a lesson in fast
breaking.

By the time the first half was
over, Hampden-Sydney was wond-
ering just what had hit them.
The Generals had streaked to a
60-39 halftime lead, and were
never in serious trouble the rest
of the way as they coasted to a
100-80 win.

Lichtfuss closed out his basket-
ball career with a game-high 21
points. Podgajny and Williams
followed wiht 16 and 14 each,
while Jerry Porath added 10
markers in his final game in the
Generals’ blue and white.

The smile on Verne Confield’s
face as he got off the team bus
Monday night was one of the
widest seen on this campus for a
long time. And who could blame
him.

Doug Ford to travel to NCAA meet

Washington and Lee wrestler
Doug Ford, the 167-pound state
champion, will compete in the
NCAA national championship
tournament (Division II) this
weekend in Wilkes-Barre, Pa.

It will be the third trip to the
nationals for the Generals’ junior
co-captain from East Islip, N.Y.
Ford finished the season with a
14-4-1 record in dual meets and
was 3-1 in tournaments for an
overall mark of 17-5-1. Included
were 14 pins.

Broun: essayist, not reporter

Descending from the dizzying
heights of television stardom
much like Zeus descending from

the heights of Olympia, CBS
sports essayist Heywood Hale
Broun shared some of his ad-

ventures and his multi-syllabic
words with the Washington and
Lee community Monday night.

Broun, here as part of Contact
‘74, pleaded for inaccuracy with
a crowd of over 500 in Lee Chapel
as he described the “art” of his
profession. Broun called report-
ing a summation of “poetry and
facts you can gather at the mo-
ment.”

In typical fashion, the CBS
essayist wore a patchwork sport-
coat of every pattern imaginable,
and then some. As far as his taste
in clothes, he said the next step
for him is “either fluorescence or
nudity.”

Broun plucked apples of wis-
lom from his experience in the
sports world as he explained his
profession. Among other observa-
tions, he noted that Super Bowl
I's most interesting aspect was its
halftime show, that football in
general] is more interesting if it’s
badly played, and that Oakland is

about as exciting a place as
Tierra de] Fuego in southern most
South America.

Broun also related his experi-
ences at the last two Olympics,
from kayak racing, with 83
officials lined up along the course
(“How does one cheat in a kayak
race?”) to the tragedy of the
Munich terrorism. He said the
Olympics should be abolished, if
only because they are a game not
for the athletes, but for the old
men who run them.
