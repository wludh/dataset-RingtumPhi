2 arrested for weekend thefts
in dorms; third suspect sought

By STEVE YEVICH

Two men were apprehended by
police early Sunday morning in
Saker Dormitory and _ charged
\ith breaking and entering.

Craig R. Nelson (W&L class of
72), of Greenvillage, New Jersey,
and Robert George Conway, of
Scranton, Pennsylvania, were dis-
covered in rom 310 by several
law students shortly after 1 a.m.,
and a call was placed to police
neadquarters at 1:15 a.m. Lexing-
ton police soon arrived on the
scene and arrested the two. The
men were subsequently charged
with breaking and entering.

Robert Murray, University
Proctor, reports that there is an-
other suspect, who will be picked
up and questioned as soon as he
is seen again.

A rash of thefts occurred dur-
ing the weekend in the Freshmen
Dorms. Steve Good discovered on
Thursday that his ten-speed bi-
evele had been stolen from the
laundry room. On Friday night
Trip Wornom’s tape deck and
“eadphones were taken from his
voom (282). A set of stereo head-
shones was stolen from Cal Col-
vin’s room (101) Saturday night.
Ken Walter’s wallet, containing
$50, was also taken Saturday
night from his room (463). Rob

one took his wristwatch and wal-
let between 11 p.m. Saturday and
1 a.m, Sunday. On Sunday morn-
ing Tim Vaughan discovered that
a suit, jacket and headphones

were missing from his room
(426). A watch and a wallet con-
taining $41 were taken from Sol
Brotman’s room (11-212) between
8:25 and 9 Sunday morning.

Mr. Murray said that he has
some clues and several suspects
in mind concerning these rob-
beries, but as yet he has no sub-
stantial evidence.

Tower of Power, Freddie King here

By ROME SCOTT

Tower of Power comes to town this Friday bring-
ing Freddie King and Sylvester and his Hot Band
with it.

The concert ticket-selling campaign will have al-
ready begun by the time this article appears but
there is still time for the slackers to get their
tickets.

Tickets are being sold at the Co-op all day Thurs-
dav and Friday.

The Tower of Power concert is the first to be put
on by the Entertainment Committee in conjunction
with Willard “Gabbo” Galbreath, a Norfolk promoter
who has worked with the Rolling Stones, Jethro Tull
and other big name groups.

Although the promotion effort is much more ex-
tensive for this concert than for the Scruggs affair,
participation by the Washington and Lee student
body is still inyportant to the success of the show.

The 1il-man Oakland group, Tower of Power
headlines the bill for good reasons according to re-
cent reviews of the band’s concerts.

A powerful combination of rock and blues, the
g-oup has wowed audiences up and down the West
Coast for several years.

Tower of Power’s first two albums, “Easy Bay
Grease” and “Bump City” both made the national
best-selling charts and hit singles “You’re Still a
Young Man” and “So Very Hard to Go” brought the
band into the national top-40 scene.

A colorful mix of well-coordinated horns and
heavy rhythm patterns, Tower of Power puts down
a move-your-soul sound that won’t let an audience
sit still.

Freddie King is one of the most dynamic blues
guitarists to emerge from the conglomerate of the
look-alike blues music world.

King has been a background composer for a
number of years giving well-known performers such
as Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page the material that
helped make them famous.

“Hideaway”, “Going Down” and “Have You Ever
Loved a Woman” have influenced even the highest
echelons of the music world. These and other Freddie
King songs make up the final medley of most Led
Zeppelin concerts.

Friday night’s concert will assuredly live up to

the name of the top-billed group and be a tower of
power not worth missing.

give to the faculty next month.

The UC proposal called for a
summary of any debate on any
topic requested by a University
Council member. The summary
would be prepared by a member
of the faculty and released within
24 hours of the meeting to WLUR,
the president of the student body,
and the university news service,
and the Ring-tum Phi (see edi-
torial, page 2). The proposal was
voted for by the UC after a pro-
posal by Ted Amshoff, a W&L
senior, was rejected, 3-18. The se-
cond proposal was passed un-
animously save for one absten-
tion.

 

Faculty meetings are still held
behind closed doors, but a move-
ment may be afoot to change
that situation.

lOUTLOOKand REVIEW

Compromising the issue

Consider the following:

A compromise is reached between an entity wishing to withhold
certain information and an entity wishing to obtain that same infor-
mation. How does the compromise work?

The entity wishing to obtain the information, entity “B’’, has to
ask the other entity, “A”, for he specific information which “B”
wishes to obtain. “A” will then prepare a summary of the informa-
tion requested and release it through appropriate outlets. Information
not specifically requested by “B” will be withheld.

Sound familiar? Well, you’re wrong. The case we are referring
to here is not the one going on in Washington between Nixon and
Congress over the matter of the tapes; rather, We are concerned
here with a proposed compromise between the faculty of Washington
and Lee and the students over the matter of closed faculty meetings.

The University Council last Thursday voted to recommend to the
faculty that the presiding officer of the faculty meeting appoint a
member of the faculty to prepare a summary of debate of issue at
the meetings for release to WLUR, the president of the student body,
the campus news service, and the Phi. Only issues specifically request-
ed by a UC member will be “reported,” if that term can even be ap-
plied here.

The faculty has tabled the motion until its December meeting,
referring it to the faculty executive committee for study.

If nothing else, this is at least a step in the right direction. Cer-
tainly the faculty will not be “harassed” by this move, and certainly
members of that group will still be able to come out with “in process”
and ‘“‘half-embryonic” statements, as one professor put it, without any
fear of these statements being circulated for, good lord, the students
to find out about.

Of course, the ideal situation in our eyes is for the meetings to be
opened fully, save for executive sessions on discussions of individual
matters, but the ideal is somewhat unattainable in this circumstance.

After all, you can impeach Nixon, but there’s nothing you can do
to the faculty.

—P.J.L.

H e e ti
ypocrisy in action

While we are on the subject of closed faculty meetings, we find
ourselves awed by the actions of the Executive Committee of the
student body in regard to the closed meetings.

The EC fully endorsed the proposal initially introduced to the
University Council calling for the opening of faculty meetings except
when matters involving individual students are discussed. The EC
apparently thought that openness was of such importance at these
meetings that a stipulation in writing be made to open the meetings.

Yet, this same EC rejected a proposal earlier this year which
would have delineated in writing that EC meetings are to be open
except when matters involving individual students are discussed.

If any faculty members knew of this, it would be of no wonder
why such a proposal concerning faculty meetings would be shot down.

We are certain the EC calls executive session only in such in-
stances concerning individual students, but that is not the point. The
EC by law (or lack thereof) could ostensibly call an executive session
on any matter it would desire. This, in light of the EC’s backing of the
proposal to open faculty meetings, is absurd. More than that, it is
hypocrisy.

We are ecstatic that the EC backed the proposal to open faculty
meetings, yet we are also dismayed. There simply is no room in the
intellectual confines of this university for a double standard.

—P.J.L.

The great potato chip scandal

Chalk one up for our side.

After receiving several complaints in recent weeks about the
amount of potato chips in your run-of-the-mill potato chip bag in the
Co-op, manager James Toler called in a state weights-and-measures
official and had the lot of potato chip bags then on the Co-op counter
weighed.

Sure enough, the average weight of the bags was less than the
average weight listed on the bags themselves.

Consequently, the suppliers of said potato chip bags were notified
and all is to be corrected within another week, says Mr. Toler. The
great potato chip scandal has come to an abrupt halt. If all is not cor-
rected within a week, the distributor may be in for a fine.

Let’s hear it for the good guys.

Ask Traveler

A concerned student recently wrote to report finding red bricks
under the mattress of his bed, saying also that Cyrus McCormick
often appeared in dreams to complain that the statue on the front lawn
really WAS Robert E. Lee—like all the tourists thought—while he, on
the other hand, was much taller with wavy hair.

Obviously, this student suffered from colonnadia extremis, an
acute pyschological condition prevalent at W&L during the bleak win-
ter months of the year and characterized by sudden runs on the View-
Master supply at Macks (-the ones with the twenty color slides of
Miami Beach included.) The cause for this mental disorder is simply
an overexposure to the Washington and Lee campus itself. The per-
vasive theme of colonial archetecture throughout the entire college
and the studied simplicity of the campus makes most students wish
that the much-maligned designer of Reid Hall had given freer reign to
his Victorian penchant for the grotesque. Frankly, what this uni-
versity needs is a change of pace! Even out of sight of the campus, one
is not free from its depressing influence. Just like a quick look at the
postcards in any Lexington hotel and restaurant: “view of the Colon-
nade with snow from the front;” “view of the Colonnade in the spring
from the side;” “view of the Colonnade during Autumn from House
Mountain.” And Lee Chapel is even worse, especially since the opening
of the faculty art show in duPont—it’s frightening how two grown
men can find one building so fascinating!

Special layouts in magazines, photos in catalogues, prints for sale
—everywhere one is bombarded by tons of campus paraphanalia,
until one is forced, for the sake of his sanity, to come into class via
the football field to escape the maddening two-tone charm of the
front campus. Even the photographers who deliberately peddle their
brainwashing smut succumb to their subject. So crazed was one
Lynchburg camera buff that in an attempt to get “the perfect shot” of
the Colonnade he became tangled in the machinery of the Lee Chapel
chimes and was crushed to death at noon. And the year before, an
artist working in pastels on the front lawn was found dangling from
the roof of Washington Hall, coercing an RSVP out of Ol’ George for
a midnite soiree at the Corner Grill.

So, until Spring wafts the coldness away and the road to Macon
opens, little can be done about colonnadia extremis. Temporary relief
may be found in animal husbandry, guided tours of the VMI bar-
racks, prank telegrams to Roger Mudd, or a can of lighter fluid and

the Washington Annex floor-plan.

The rising cost of W&L tuition:
up 25 per cent since 1970-71

y TIM MOORE

The cancerous cost of living has
ulcerated successfully through
the tuition tissues of W&L life,
and the revelation of a new pana-
cea to curb the growth is hidden
in the sumptuary future.

This year W&L seniors are pay-
ing 25% more for tuition than
they paid as college freshmen four
vears ago. And if one considers
every expense that the student
pays from September to May, it is
costing the average W&L man
close to $5,000 a year for his col-
lege education.

In the academic year of 1960-61,
tuition costs at Washington and
Lee were set at $750 and the col-
lege estimated that the average
costs for two semesters at W&L
that year would be approximately
$1,750. Just 10 years later in the
academic year 1970-71, tuition had
nearly tripled at $2,000 and the
average expenditure for the stu-
dent had soared to $3,100.

A well-known television adver-
tisement states that college tui-
tion pays only one-third the cost
of a college education. This fact is
rue for public universities and
colleges, but doesn’t apply to pri-
vate institutions such as W&L.
Schools like the University of
Virginia receive state aid and are

therefore subjected to some state
regulation, but W&L must find its
aid from other sources. These
“other sources” are the funds
from the alumni and various en-
dowments which pay about 40%
of the W&L student’s education.
Tuition at W&L pays about 60%
of the cost.

“The schools that are in real
trouble”, explains Mr. James
Whitehead, W&L’s business man-
ager, “are the ones in which col-
lege tuition pays about 90% of
the cost of education, because if
a couple of students decide not to
show up in the fall, then the
school’s budget has been slashed
drastically. A private institution
must depend largely on gifts from
their alumni.”

At Davidson College in North
Carolina where a 28.2% increase
in tuition has occurred in the past
four years, college tuition pays
about 57% of the student’s edu-
cation. “I would like to see W&L’s
tuition cover only 50% of a stu-
dent’s education with the other
50% being covered by alumni and
endowments,” said Mr. White-
head.

While W&L has not been forced
to “go public” like many other in-
stitutions have had to, the school
is depending on a stability of in-
come that is just “keeping them
up” with the cost of living. This
financial stability is witnessed by
no drastic fluctuation of students
through the years and by an in-
crease in giving and endowments.
In 1960 when the W&L student
was paying $750 tuition, the
school had an operating budget
of $2 million. In the year 1972,
the tuition showed a three fold
increase from 1960 along with a
three fold increase in the Univer-
sity’s operating costs also, demon-
strating that the school is “just
keeping up with the cost of liv-
ing.”

University is that of financial aid.
A student who received financial
aid in 1970-71 needs 25% more aid
to go to W&L in 1973-74. The Uni-
versity supplies this additional
aid.

Will Washington and Lee have
to go public in the future? Mr.
James Whitehead doesn’t believe
so: “We’re getting almost adequate
support at the present, but to
keep up with living costs, our
giving must increase.”

A look at the accompanying
chart illustrates that W&L is not
alone in the increase of tuition.
The Princeton student has seen a
32% increase in the past four
years while the Baptist-supported
Wake Forest has had only a 17.6%
increase. These figures are tuition
and fees only, and do not include
additional costs such as meals,
laundry, fraternities, and the like.

No school has been able to cut
tuition costs in the past five
vears,

Since 1960, Washington and
Lee’s tuition has jumped from
$750 to the present $2,500. In only
one year, from 1961-62, was there
not an increase by at least $100
in the tuition fee, and in many
years there was a $200 hike in-
crease.

What can students expect in
the future? As long as it keeps
costing professors more to live, as
it keeps costing more for main-
tenance people to provide for
their families, and as long as
books for the library and myriads
of other research material in-
creases steadily in costs, then so
W&L’s tuition will rise also. Un-
fortunately, the W&L student has
to be taught by others and their
time needs money.

Contributions continue
for development program

The development program an-
nounced on February 22, 1972,
has been able to raise 61.1% of its
goal for 1976. The campaign is
divided into two phases, the sec-
ond to be accomplished by 1979.

As of September 30, 1973, $22,-
007,868 has been given toward
the Phase I goal of $36,000,000.
Already more than $399,000 has
been donated toward the second
phase of the drive. Ultimately the
schoo! hopes to receive $56,000,-
000 by the end of Phase II in
1979.

The money pledged to capital
improvements for Washington
and Lee is being used in many
ways. From such gifts three new
buildings are being financed:
Lewis Hall, a new undergraduate
library, and the completed addi-
tion to Doremus Gymnasium.
The program also seeks funds to
enlarge the school’s endowment.
The Phase I goal for endowment
contributions is $12,000,000 of
which almost 40% has been given.
By 1979 twenty-four million is to
be added to the endowment from
both phases of the program.

The program is only partially
devoted to Physical expansion of
the campus’ facilities. In fact the
Development Office hopes to raise
one dolar for the endowment
and supplementary income for
each dollar pledged toward build-
ing.

Thus far the campaign has pro-
gressed well and several specific
have been reached. At a
snigle blow Mr. and Mrs. Sydney
Lewis financed the law school
and a special endowment for it of
$2,000,000. The goals for current
gifts toawrd the annual support
of the institution is over two-
thirds realized with $2,374,356
having been contributed by Sep-
tember 30, 1973.

goals

The gymnasium is completed
but is only 40% paid for at the
present time. Toward the new li-
brary about 35% of the money
needed has been received. The
remainder must be pledged or
given by late this summer for the
building to begin on schedule.

In the first year of the fund
raising campaign well over 50%
of the 1976 goal of $36,000,000 was
accomplished. Most of this has
come in commitments of large
sums of money. To date three con-
tributions of over a million have
been accepted. Twenty-six gifts in
excess of $100,000 and eighty-two
of $10,000 or over have added
much of the remainder. At this
point large gifts are still being
sought first while the drive for
smaller donations has not really
gotten into full swing.

The director of the overall ef-
fort is John M. Stemmons of Dal-
las, Texas. Mr. Stemmons is a
trustee and chairman of the A-
chievement Council which con-
sists of thirty-eight volunteers,
mosly alumni. The council is di-
vided into committees which con-
cenrate on different groups of po-
tential donors, i.e. alumni, par-
ents, foundations, and corpora-
tions.

Many alumni have answered to
the call for aid in this effort with
over two hundred _ volunteers
working in the program. The
friends of the university have re-
sponded enthusiastically thus far
but there is still a long way to go.

Madison defeats

booters by 3-1

By BILL AUSTIN

In a pivotal meeting with Madi-
son College last Thursday, the
W&L soccer team had its hopes
for a post-season tournament
berth erased. Madison prevailed,
3-1, in the evenly-played contest,
saddling the Generals with their
third defeat of the season.

Both teams were hampered by
strong wind rendering consistent
passing vulnerable to. erratic
gusts. Despite the difficulty posed
by nature, W&L put together a
generally strong effort, keyed by
the outstanding performance of
Paul Devine as goalie. Unfortun-
ately, the game was lost at the
half-back positions, where Madi-
son players demonstrated a tell-
ing superiority in controlling the
offensive tempo of attack.

Madison held a 1-0 half-time
bulge, and widened its lead to 3-0
before the Generals’ John Embry
managed an unassisted score to
tighten the battle. Madison’s goals
did not come easily, but were the
results of two deflections and a
penalty shot. Indeed, both squads
had 16 shots on goal, and the
Wé&L_ attack muffed several
chances to score in situations of
real opportunity. Risking an apo-
logetic tone, it must be said that
the outcome could have been
quite different, barring a few un-
timely breaks.

The team’s schedule gets no
less demanding with a foe such
as Navy on tap for the season
wrap-up of Saturday, November
17, a home game to be played at
2 p.m. Wilson Field will serve as
converted soccer turf, providing
a more suitable setting for the
display of the two talented
squads.

In its last regular meet of the
1973 fall season, the Washington

team succumbed to Eastern Men-

davs after the fourth place finish
in the Virginia College Athletic
Association’s state meet, was the
sixth of the year for the squad
However, the win-total of eight
represents a fine achievement for
a team not without its share of

W&L loses fifth straight

By BILL FLESHER

Rick Fulwood is a sophomore
at Southwestern University at
Memphis .

He stands only five foot nine,
and weighs but 160 pounds.

He plays offensive halfback for
Southwestern’s football team.

For a guy that size he’s a hell-
uva good football player.

Fulwood carried the ball an
amazing 47 times last Saturday,
good for 162 yards. Along with
quarterback Mike Hanna, Ful-
wood led the Lynx to a 13-6 win
over Washington and Lee’s Gen-
erals in front of a Parents’ Day
crowd at Wilson Field last Sat-
urday.

The loss, the fifth straight for
WE&L this year, was a great dis-
appointment for the Generals in
that they could have won the
game just as easily as they lost
it.

The W&L offense moved the
ball well, but could put it in the
end zone just once. And the Gen-
erals’ defense, led by Rick Kulp,
co-captain Bill Wallace, and Steve
VanAmburgh, who was in on 19
tackles, time and time again turn-
ed in the big play when needed.

But it simply was not to be
the Generals’ day.

After a scoreless first quarter,
the Lynx took a 7-0 lead midway
through the second period on a
two vard run by Hanna.

The touchdown was set up
when Phil Mulkey picked off a
Jack Berry pass and returned it
to the W&L 42.

Southwestern then took seven
plays to get into the end zone, the
biggest of them a 15 yard penalty
against the Generals for unneces-
sary roughness.

WE&L put on a march toward
the end of the half, which died

at the Lynx 25 when Berry, on
the last play of the first half,
threw another interception, this
time to linebacker Phil Brantley.

The Generals took the second
half kickoff and put together two
drives to get on the board.

Impossible, you say.

To an extent, yes.

The Generals could not pick up
a first down on the possession im-
mediately after the kickoff. End
of drive one.

Doug Chase then kicked it away.
Southwestern’s Conrad Bradburn
took the punt, returned it eleven
yards, and fumbled.

W&L offensive tackle Sal Ab-
bruzzese was on top of the ball
when everyone unpiled. Start of
drive two,

The Generals went 43 yards in
seven plays, with Bob Lindsey
going in for the score from the
one. Twenty-four of those yards
came on a Jim Farrar run, the
longest run from scrimmage by
any W&L back this year.

However Ralph Moore’s_ kick
was wide, and the Generals trail-
ed 7-6.

After a short kickoff attempt
by More backfired (Tommy Sims
returned it to the W&L 483),
Southwestern marched in for its
second touchdown—make _ that
Fulwood marched for the second
touchdown .

Out of 14 plays that made up
the drive Fulwood carried the ball
on 13 of them. The only play on
which Fulwood did not get his
hands on the pigskin was a key
one in the drive—a fourth and
four play on which Hanna hit
Andy Chunn for six yards and a
first down.

Fulwood, after all his efforts,
deserved the touchdown. He got
it from one yard out. The extra

point attempt hit he upright, so
it was Southwestern 13, W&L 6.

After the kickoff, W&L moved
the ball to the Southwestern 23.
The drive stalled there, so Moore
was called on to attempt a 40-yard
field goal.

=O good. Long
wide to the right.

That would be as close as W&L
would come to getting a second
score the rest of the game.

With about four minutes left
the W&L defense put the Lynx in
a deep hole, forcing them to kick
on fourth and 30 from the 10.

The Generals sent men in on
the rush, hoping for a block.

Chunn, who handled Southwes-
tern’s punting, got a great kick
away under the pressure—a much
better kick than expected by
safetyman Mike Brittin.

Brittin did the right thing by
signaling for the fair catch.

He might have done two wrong
things by trying to catch a kick
that was sailing over his head.

Southwestern recovered, and
ran out most of the clock before
giving the ball back to W&L.

When the Generals got it back
they had a long way—93 yards to
be exact—and not much time—
13 seconds—to go.

And soon after
record Was 2-0,

This week Washington and Lee
travels to Granville, Ohio to take
on the Big Red of Denison Uni-
versity.

Last year, in Lexington, Deni-
son romped 52-22. This year, how-
ever, as are the Generals, they’re
having problems winning. Going
into last week’s action, Denison’s
reeord stood at 2-5.

That game begins at 1:30 Sat-
urday. WLUR will broadcast the
game live beginning at 1:20 p.m.

DOCKSIDERS

Grab a pair of Sebago Docksiders when you're fitting
out. The construction is rugged. The design is
sound. Sebago, with years of experience making
boating moccasins, engineered a combination of the
finest materials into a super deck shoe. Then tested
it in the 1970 Bermuda Cup Race. Results: remark-

able performance.

Examine the elk tanned cowhide upper. Built to re-
sist salt, perspiration, mildew. Test the white rubber,
sure-grip, non-slip sole. Either ashore or afloat, this
sole tread refuses to pick up san dor pebbles, Won't
scratch brightwork or canvas deck. Lay hold of the
rawhide lacings. Size up the salt-resistant, nylon and
dacron stitching throughout.

Docksiders mean quality. Quality that’s handsewn by
Yankee craftsmen. Others try to imitate. Docksiders
are built to refute imitation — and they cost less.

both beneficial and necessary un-
der certain conditions.”

“T am making ‘The Damned’
for the generations who do not
know what Nazism was like,” the
director said. In pointing the fin-
ger of responsibility at German
industrialists who helped create
the madness of the Second World
War by backing Hitler with vital
arms, Visconti points out, “The
young people must understand
that it is the absence of protest
that constitutes the blackest evil
in my drama.”

For their weekly “Film Classics”
selection, the W&L Film Commit-
tee have selected the Sidney Lu-
met film of Anton Chekhov’s The
Sea Gull. The film, which stars
James Mason and Vanessa Red:
grave, is extremely faithful to
Chekhov's classic drama of a
group of wealthy 19th century
Russians who are plagued by
frustrations, unrequited loves and
failed ambitions. The Sea Gull
will be shown in duPont Audi-
torium at 7:00 p.m. Tuesday, No-
