olumnist Art Buchwald to visit
here in Contact 74 symposium

 

Art Buchwald

By BILL AUSTIN

Art Buchwald, the man Time
Magazine has labeled ‘the most
successful humorous columnist
in the United States,’ will put
aside his devastating pen for a
visit to the W&L campus on Mon-
day, March 4th. His appearance
will include a 3:30 p.m. stop-in at
the Bookstore for coffee and in-
formal talk, followed by an 8
p.m. speech at Lee Chapel.

Buchwald now joins film-maker
William Friedkin as part of the
Contact Committee’s 1974 offer-
ing. In keeping with this year’s
Contact theme of twentieth-cen-
tury arts, this columnist, author
playwright and media-personality
exudes a special kind of artistry,
for he is the acknowledged master
of caustic, truth-telling wit. Con-
sequently, his syndicated column,
“Capitol Punishment,” is includ-
ed in more than 400 newspapers

world-wide, while his personal
appearances have drawn raves

and roars.

Gazing clear-sightedly into the
heart of Washington’s scandals
and intrigues, Buchwald extracts
simple meanings which reduce
the maze of governmental his-
trionics to comprehendable fop-
pery.

Though his verbal jabs some-
times offend, they allow readers
to enjoy a brief respite from the
crisis-atmosphere that seemingly
pervades the land. Indeed, Buch-
wald salvages smiles in an en-
vironment of non-stop grimness
That, by any standard, is achieve-
ment of the highest sort.

Buchwald makes from 35 to 40
paid speeches per year, yet still
approaches the chore with vi-
talitv and anticipation. In a recent
Washington Post interview, he
called the experience “a great
way to get out of the city and
talk to people. I get a lot of
ideas from it for the column
It's very stimulating.” Then, lest
anyone take him too seriously,
he added, “It's an-egotrip ...
besides the dough.”

ment. The amendment is as
follows:

To Article IV, add See. ¥ which
reads:

The Committee shall in no
case meet in Executive Session
ov in any other form of meet-
ing closed to the Student Body
for any reason whatsoever ex-
cept when it shall meet to con-
sider possible Honor violations,

 

The EC endorsed Brittin’s ideas
unanimously,

Brittin said that SAB was quite
pleased about the turnout for As

play lost about $500. The commit-
tee has a new treasurer, Bob
Wyckoff.

Student Body President Doug

Chinese studies forum scheduled Feb. 5

By HERB RUBENSTEIN

The Student Curriculum Com-
mittee will host a student-faculty
forum Tuesday that will intro-
duce the new Chinese Studies pro-
gram.

Dean William Webb Pusey,
program chairman, and several
other faculty members who will
participate in next year’s pro-
gram will explain the new areas
to be offered in Chinese history,
literature, religion, politics,
nomics, language, and art.

Currently, the Chinese Studies
program is looking into new
course possibilities and will use

eco:

this forum to evaluate student
interest in this area. The Chinese
Studies program is not completely
structured at present and Dean
Pusey and the faculty want stu-

dent suggestions so the course
offerings next vear will reflect
student interest at Washington
and Lee.

W&L received a $30,000 grant
from the Mary Reynolds Babcock
Foundation to support the de-
velopment of this Chinese Studies
program. The success of this pro-
gram now depends on student in-
terest and support, according to
Dean Pusey. The program offers

new courses and library resources
in addition to a foreign exchange
program with the Chung Chi Uni-
versity in Hong Kong. W&L cur-
rently offers spring term courses
abroad in Japan and Taiwan.
Dean Pusey has said that if stu-
dent interest is large enough, the
school may be able to offer a
major in Chinese or Far Eastern
studies in the near future.

Student interested in Chinese
Studies may contact Dean Pusey,
duPont Hall, and attend the
Chinese Studies Form-Tuesday at
7:30 p.m. in Room 113 of the Uni-
versity Center.

UTLOOK and REVIEW

On the upcoming referendum

Next Thursday, Friday and Monday, an amendment to the Student
Body Constitution pertaining to closed body Executive Committee
sessions will come up for a vote in a referendum.

The proposal would limit closed EC session to the discussion of
possible honor violations. The EC meeting would have to remain
open on discussion of any other matters.

While we are certain the EC has called closed sessions for what
it feels are appropriate circumstances, the amendment is not a
trivial one. Government, no matter how powerless it seems to be,
can work wonders when its decisions are made behind closed doors,
and our student government is no exception.

We have already seen changes made by the EC in the honor
system trial procedure without student input, changes which do not
necessarily prove to be in the best interests of the individual student
at Washington and Lee. There can be no student input from sources
outside the EC if that body’s doors are closed during the discussion
of any matters of interest to the entire student body.

The proposed amendment would deny the EC the power to discuss
and rule on changes affecting the students as a whole. Only cases in-
volving individual students would be discussed if the amendent

passes.

The proposed amendment is simple. It’s a matter of the student
body’s right to know. Vote for it.

A proposed curriculum survey

The Student Curriculum Committee, after its rather unsuccessful
curriculum survey last fall, is ready to try again.

The committee has proposed to take another student survey on
various courses, this one scheduled for Feb. 20 and 21. This second
survey has the potential of much greater success than that of last fall.

The committee has proposed that surveys be distributed in class
on those days, that the professors take five minutes off from class
time to distribute the surveys. The students would answer the
relatively short surveys in that five minutes, voicing their opinions
on just one fall term course each.

There are four evaluative (e.g. excellent to poor) questions on the
proposed survey and one short answer question designed to rate the
course and point out strengths and weaknesses.

The idea is to accumulate opinions about fall term courses as an
aid particularly to incoming freshmen. In addition, such a survey has
the potential of aiding upperclassmen looking for distribution fullfill-
ment or looking to take courses in a new department, A survey of
fall term courses is being taken now simply because students have
fully completed the course, final exam and all.

The idea behind the proposed survey and the proposed method
of running the survey are both excellent. A guide to first term courses
can be useful if the survey is comprehensive and the survey could
be comprehensive if it is given during class time. Both should earn
the proposed survey student and faculty support.

We do, however, question the questions, as it were. The questions,
as now proposed, ask how intellectually challenging the course was,
how the quality of instruction was, how the course overall was in
both quality and difficulty, and what the positive and negative aspects
of the course were. The short answer question also asks for sugges-
tions for improvement.

We realize that five minutes is a short period of time in which
to solicit comprehensive answers about a course. We do, however, feel
the questions, as currently proposed, are very general, perhaps too
general for the purpose of the survey.

For instance, consider the average answers to the survey on a
hypothetical course: the course was fairly intellectually challenging,
the quality of instruction was fair, the quality of the course was fair,
and, in terms of difficulty, the course was moderate. And, in the
short answer section, answers range from “it was great” to “it was
the worst course I’ve ever taken here.” Somehow those evaluations
wouldn’t tell too much about the course.

Unfortunately, under the proposed survey, there would probably
be much more than a handful of courses which would be evaluated
as such, And nothing useful is obtained from the survey.

We suggest to the University Council, which will hopefully view
the proposed survey today, and to the faculty, which will consider the
proposal Monday, that they consider changes to the proposed survey.
The idea is a good one, but the physical structure of the idea, if
allowed to be administered unchanged, may defeat the purpose of
the survey itself.

Suicide letter reply
Sir:

This is in response to last

and is directed to the writer of
the letter and the persons he
represents,

It is a tragic thing for some-
one to take his life, because there
is meaning to life to those who
seek it.

The concern that this person
and others are looking for can
be found among those who know
how to and do express love and
concern to these lonely persons.
I am talking about true believers
in God. They will go out of their
way to help people undestand.

of concern, then talk to these
people. You might try going to
one of the churches in town an
meeting some people who care
about you. If you are somewhat
shy toward a big church, there
is a smaller church on Houston
Street with usually about 10 or
15 persons, all very friendly anc

A Preview of Spring Course Offerings.

—English 400: Hygienic Grammar. A forum on correct word usage
conducted with a healthy contempt for the student. Topics covered
include: the subjunctive as a cavity fighter of the future; why
student nurses resent being treated as direct objects by singie
scholars; the case for washing one’s hands after dangling a
participle; 10 easy ways to embarrass a gerund in public.

—Music 006: A review of Medieval music from its birth in Italy to
its gall bladder operation in Buffalo, New York, with primary focus
on Johann Klutz (1472-1555) who was considered frygian at the
time of his divorce from his wife, Nadine. Attention also given
to period instruments, especially the bass viol which is thought
to have been originally used as a Coleman lantern during the Dark
Ages.

—Journalism 750: Film-making. (Prerequisite: junior standing it
there aren’t enough chairs to go around.) Students will practice
the fundamentals of splicing, cutting, dubbing film, and breaking
into Reid Hall after hours. Intensive studying of the psychological
impact of modern movies, and why buttered popcorn stains theatre
upholstery during matinees.

—History 2.75: A critical survey of the United States’ lesser-known
presidents, including John Tyler, Franklin Pierce, and Manny
Jiminez before he was placed on waivers by Minnesota. Some valid
questions raised: did Martin Van Buren talk with his mouth full
at White House dinners; if Millard Fillmore didn’t like his middle
name, why didn’t he get it legally changed instead of sulking; and
why does the mention of Chester Arthur get laughs at New Years’
parties? The course wil] culminate in a trip to the National Archives
to catalogue Warren Harding’s papers and then stuff a pheasant
with them.

—Religion 344: Playing the Spiritual Fence. Visions and miracles
discussed, along with getting the punch line right when telling a
parable. The questions are asked: should a forewarding address be
left if there is an afterlife; does God exist and, if so, does He take
cream or sugar; has the Archbishop really cornered the Douglas
Fir market in Canada; and should Lazarus have sent a thank you
note or a candygram?

losided but

By ROME SCOTT

It was one of those beer-drinking days in summer when lounging
hy the pool and fanning yourself feels so good (watching those
»vikinis wiggle by, wishing one would stop).

The short, funny-looking, red-headed Englishman looked around
anxiously and repeated for the thousandth time, “They'll be right
lown.”

I nodded for the thousandth time and thought to myself, “How
the hell am I going to conduct an interview with people who speak
Dutch or Netherlandish or whatever.”

Somebody shouted from the balcony of the Holiday Inn, ers
‘s on his way and Jan’ll be down in a minute.”

Focus, some mouthful to chew and I didn’t even know how to
»ronouce their names—Thijs Van Leer, Jan Akkerman, Bert Ruiter
and Pierre Van Der Linden (no doubt about it—I’d found the right
motel).

The group from Holland was set to play a show that night, a
show I was slated to review, and somebody connected with them
‘n New York had called to tell me she was sure I wanted to talk
to them. So here I was.

Up until their performance I had heard nothing Focus had done
except the group’s top 40 releases but when I decided to do the
interview I put together some questions anyway.

First I asked the typical, dumb question nearly every American
asks a foreigner, “How do you like America?” and Van Leer smiled
(I was afraid the question might be too difficult for him to under-
stand, him being from Holland and all) and said “How the hell
should I know? All I’ve seen is the inside of hotel rooms and back-
stage dressing rooms.”

(The dude’s English was better than mine! I decided to ask him
something worthwhile—‘How do you pronounce your first name?”)

All kidding aside, Van Leer did have some interesting things
to say.

Focus is built around Jan Akkerman, lead guitar, and Van Leer,
organ and vocals. They have written most of their recent material
in motels or backstage on tour.

Their scheme for writing music is to take a primary melody and
build from it a complex sounding simplicity based in jazz-textured
rock.

Their intention is to start slow and outline the context of the
‘music so that the rest of the song can be carefully improvised to a
climactic frenzy.

Focus opened many of its numbers with a soft, interwoven
guitar-organ duet and moved through several beat changes adding
bass and drums as they went.

Classically-oriented melody lines carried by the organ or guitar
were set apart from a solid rhythmic background effecting a dramatic
difference in musical concepts.

The band’s music was a pleasant surprise of sincere and valid
musicianship built on a superior concept resulting in a progressive
view of musical intent (in other words, I was impressed).

Where do they go from here, I wondered. Then I remembered
what Akkerman had told me.

“We've got a castle rented in Holland and that’s where we're
going when this is over. Then we can get down to serious work.”

(A castle? What a life! But what is serious work?)

Herbie Hancock lives

By W. PATRICK HINELY
Headhunters
Herbie Hancock
Columbia KC 32731
Spectrum
Billy Cobham
Atlantic SD 7268

Herbie Hancock is probably one
of the most prolific recording
artists around these days. He's
played on everybody’s albums,
and a lot of people have played
on his, too.

For Headhunters he is with his
standard horn man, Bennie
Maupin, bassist Paul Jackson,
who has also rocked around San
Francisco with the likes of
Azteca, and two drummer/percus-
sionists, Harvey Mason and Bill
Summers.

Hancock, as usual, is in top
form on keyboards. He does a lot
of work with synthesizers, too,
using them like keyboards most
of the time, but his most interest-
ing application of the Arp is to
simulate strings. There are no
strings on the album, but he
puts in the same sound at points,
nicely placed for the most part.
The only place they get a little
soupy is on the last cut, “Vein
Melter,” which is the sole piece
on this album which tends _ to-
ward muzak.

Bennie Maupin’s sax and sax-
ello come out nicely all around,
especially on the opening cut
“Chameleon,” a 15 minute jam.
“Watermelon Man,” an old Han-
cock hit, gets a nice new rendi-
tion to close out side 1. “Sly,”
on side 2, is a 10-minute wander-
ing through futuristic electronic

playgrounds.

Definitely an album to. get
down with. Everybody should
like this one, no matter what

shape your head’s in. It’s music
that smiles.

Billy Cobham’s main claim to

library staff.

This is the third vear that the
course has been offered. To date
students in French, Spanish, Ger-
man, economics, English, history
and politics have been enrolled in
the course. Under the terms of
the grant any department in the
humanities and social sciences is
eligible for participation.

Dr. Edwin Craun of the Eng-
lish departments organized his
section into a nine-man seminar
last yvear. By pooling their re-
sources, the students were able
to compile a_ standard _biblio-
graphy now used by the English
department. At the end of the
course they compiled a list of the
best source materials they had
found and drew up a selected
bibliographies on their topics.

Interdepartmental 190 has been

fame seems to be his work with
John McLaughlin and the Maha-
vishnu Orchestra, a band for
whom he supplied all the atomic-
solar kind of rhythmic base they
needed, Alas, those days are gone
and he has departed to make his
own music, which will probably
prove to be a greater loss to the

Mahavishnu Orchestra than to
Cobham.
Cobham has played around

with everyone from Miles Davis
to Deodato, as well as piloting
a rock-jazz band called Dreams a
few years back, which is un-
fortunately no longer available
since the albums (on Columbia)
didn’t sell enough to keep them
in print.

Spectrum is Cobham’s first solo
album, and portentious one at
that. The music is based around
Cobham’s drumming and the key:
boards of Jan Hammer, who also
used to play in the Mahavishnu
Orchestra. Ray Barretto makes 2
nice contribution on conga, and
guitarists John Tropea (from
Deodato’s band) and Tom Bolin
(from the James gang) put in
some nice licks, too. On horns,
Joe Farrell and Jimmy Owens do
their usual proficient and exce!-
lent, though seldom innovative
work. Ron Carter and Lee Sklar
play bass, Carter being the better
of the two by far.

The songs are a mixed bag,
going from energetic space-jazz to
funky up-beat but relaxed cruis-
ing music. At points, it gets as
frenetic as McLaughlin, but the
whole aura of the album is less
urgent, though not so much as
to be laid back. Cobham’s work
is definitely straight ahead—he’s
just not hurrying about getting
spiritual. The whole feeling of
the album is that the players had
a lot of fun making it, and I
find it good for listening to in
any situation except trying to go
to sleep.

Editor’s note: This is the first

weeks, we will discuss married
student housing and on the
Woods Creek complex currently
under construction.

By TOM RITTENBURG

In an attempt to centralize all
incoming freshmen next year, the
university will be closing the
eastern half of Davis Dorm to
upperclassmen next September.

That part of the dorm will be
filled by freshmen who in previ-
ous years would have been placed
in off-campus university housing.
Thus the freshmen will all be
centralized in one area by the
move.

Upperclassmen will continue to
occupy the western, or left, side
of the dormitory.

Manwhile, Baker Dorm, that
bastion of dorm-ridden law stu-
dents, will be opened to a limited
number of upperclassmen. Most
likely, one section of the dorm
will be cordoned off for the law
students to insure the solitude
necessary for the graduate stu-
dents’ relentless pursuit of the
law.

Nelson House will be closed
down as student residence, and
Lee House II will graduate from
freshmen to upperclass residence.

Frank Parsons, Assistant to the
President, lists two reasons for
the shifting around of dorms and
students. He says in the past,
the increasing number of enter-
ing freshmen has put a strain on
housing. About 20 freshmen have
had to live in non-dormitory (Lee
House II) housing due to the
shortage of dorms available. The
university is placing these excess
freshmen in Davis to provide uni-
form dormitory housing to all
freshmen and to centrally locate
all the first year men.

Parsons also says dorm assign-
ment changes are being made be-
cause of the expected completion
of the Woods Creek apartments
by September, which will house
178 upperclassmen and law stu-
dents. No formal applications for
the apartments are being accept-
ed as of yet, and rent for the
suites will run between $650 and
$750 per student.

Those students wishing to
move into or remain in present
dormitory housing will be facing
a $100 to $125 increase in rent
next year, an increase attributed
by the administration to the ris-

Reach-Out offers

Editor’s note: This is the first
in a series of articles by re-
porter Darryl Carlton exploring
counseling and intra-personal
activities on and off campus.
‘This article describes the Reach-
Out program.

By DARRYL CARLTON

Among the organizations in the
community that are willing to
help students in need as well as
towns people is a resource that
is used less often than it could
be. This. is Reach-Out, Lexing-
ton’s counseling and referal serv-
ice that was founded three years
ago.

Reach-Out was originally form-
ed by a group of students and
community volunteers who were
concerned about the drug prob-
lem, which in the spring of 1970,

seemed to be more and more
evident.
When it was discovered that

this was more apparent than real,
Reach-Out branched out into a
three-point program: counseling
and referral for those with low-
income, drug and alcohol prob-
lems, and emotional problems.
Needless to say, these areas often
overlap.

Reach-Out is staffed entirely
from volunteers. In its first year
of operation, over fifty percent
of the volunteers were W&L stu-
dents. At that time, it remained
open 24 hours a day, but after a
vear it discovered that this was
not warranted by the amount of
time it was being used as a
counseling service. The Reach-Out

building on Main Street is now
open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. on
weekdays, from 2-10 on Satur-
days, 6-10 on Sundays. However,
there is an answering service
open for telephone calls 24 hours
a day, seven days a week, in
which an opportunity is present-
ed to leave a message or call one
of three emergency numbers for
immediate assistance if necessary.

Reach-Out, according to its
president, the Rev. Michael
Dwinnel, functions as a rap cen-
ter. People can come to the
building at 323 N. Main Street

or call 463-7301.

Rev. Dwinnell explained that
teach-Out uses non-judgmental
listening and community re-

sources to show people possible
alternatives to situations or feel-
ings they feel are causing them
difficulty, either emotionally or
financially.

National landmarks or eyesores?
Carnal knowledge

By LEIGH CHAPPEL

“They oinked at me!” Needless
to sav, Leigh Chappel, your basic
coed, Was rather shocked by this
reception at her first class.

However, things began to look
up. “When Joe College asked me
today why I came to W&L and
| answered for the 87th time that
it wasn’t necessarily my_ social
life, I think he might have be-
lieved me!”

What about these “national
landmarks?” If they didn’t come
for their social life, why did they
come?

On an exchange from a wo-
nen’s college a coed is frequently
asked the question, “Have your
attitudes toward the boys chang-
ed now that vou are placed in
an academic atmosphere with
them rather than the weekend,
party atmosphere?” The answer
is, “SGe-

Perhaps a fundamental reason
that coeds come to an all-male
university is to live in a more
natura] atmosphere where males
can be taken down from the
pedestal they are placed on from
the perspective of a women’s col-
lege. Its nice to know that the
same males who “gator’ also

’

function as students in an intel-
lectual atmosphere. Besides gain-
ing a new outlook on the male
way of life, coeds also gain re-
spect for their male peers.

The transition from a women’s
college to a male university is
not without surprises. At one
point Leigh Chappel was accost-
ed in the Co-op and accused of
“being a distraction in the library”

merely because she was there.
The suggestion was_ offered,

“Why not study in the stacks?”

With this in mind, if you come
across a pair of feet staring at
vou from within the periodicals,
don’t be distracted. It’s only Leigh
Chappel, the same girl who was
asked at a fraternity party last
Friday night, “I’ve never dated
a coed; why did you come?
What’s it like walking to class?
Do you eat meals in Lexington?
Do vou have a tendency to breath
oxygen as regular girls do?”

So the next time you see
Leigh Chappel walking, talking,
breathing, eating, and even study-
ing who knows where, why don’t
you declare her a national land-
mark and treat her with the
respect you would Lee Chapel?

Porcine prattle

By M. C. PiG

“She sat next to me! Of all the
gall. She could have at least sat
in the back of the classroom.”

M. S. Pig, your basic male
chauvinist pig, was very much
humiliated by the forwardness of
this brazzen hussy. In retaliation
he “oinked” at her.

However, things began to go
from bad to worse. “When Leigh
Chappel asked me today if I felt
threantened by her presence at
W&L,” I merely replied, being
too much of a stud and gentle-
man to say more, that I found her
pollution of our pure environ-
ment exceptionally tedious. As
usual, she was not to be put off
and insisted that I have a date
with her this weekend to discuss
the matter in depth, or in as much
depth as I could offer her.”

The existence of coeds on the
campus of General Lee’s college
is to be considered nothing less
thadn pure plasphemy. It only
confirms the realistic, ie. nega-
tive, attitude of the opposite sex
which we have so long enjoyed
here in such blessed isolation.

Perhaps if the gardeners of
this dread creeping feminism
which treatens to choke our very
roots sincerely want to gain the
respect of the male sex they
could find the means of doing so
by respecting our privacy. Alas,
they have already invaded and
their numbers are_ increasing
periodically. There are several
ways, however, in which these
amazons may still redeem them-
selves.

The coeds might become the
good fairies of the campus. They
could relieve the highly efficient

male janitorial squad by taking
on their duties in the freshman
dormitories. If they want to prove
their talents they could do what
they are best at—making beds,
knitting sweaters and mufflers,
and giving massages. Also, an in-
terested pre-med student might
drill them into an able group of
helpers for Nurse Agnor.

Once I asked Leigh Chappe! if
she wanted a drink when I saw
her standing alone at a fraternity
party. Her sweet lady-like reply
was, “What? Don’t you think I
have enough strength and cour-
age to get myself a drink if I
want one? You’re as bad as my
date. That ‘turkey’ had the nerve
to open my car door when we
got here so I’m letting myself
get snaked. Want to play?”

Leigh still wanted to play when
the date was over. One night she
found me in the library and
started cooing and petting ime.
I won’t repeat her colorful reply
when I later told her that she
was “being a distraction in the
library.”

All of us can help to see our
way through this hard time. If
vou have a chance, sit an amazon
down and tell her about Adam’s
rib. And remember, they can
usually be controlled as they are
almost always willing to “stoop
to be conquered.”

W&L swimmers lose to Duke, 76-37,
face William and Mary here Friday

Last Saturday afternoon, Wash-
ington and Lee’s swimming Gen-
evals suffered a lopsided defeat,
76-37, at the hands of the power-
ful Duke University Blue Devils.
rhe loss dropped the
dual meet record to
and three losses.

Coach Bill Stearns characteriz-
ed the contest as a “fun meet
that gave our team the opportun-

Generals
five wins

itv to swim against some good
competition in preparation for
William and Mary and the state

meet.”

Despite the loss there were
some very bright spots for the
Generals. Captain Will Brother-
ton, a junior from Chariesion,
W.Va., took a first in the gruel-

ling 200 vd. fly.

Freshman Porter McNeil from

Jacksonville, Fla, breezed
through the 1000 yd. freestyle, en
route to breaking the school rec-
ord with a time of 10:59.2.

Bill Tiers, a sophomore from
Vero Beach, Fla., had previously
held the record, eclipsing the old
record in last year’s state meet
and breaking his own record set
last week at Richmond. In the
meet with Duke, he took a sec-

At press time, the two media

to play either regular 10 minute

ning time.

The contest renews a Classic
series between the two squads,
dating back to the early 1970's.
The Ring-tum Five hold a decisive

at 1-1-0.

which they humiliated the Bot-

WLUR won the initial contest

feel the quickness of a five-guard
offense will prevail.

Decisions gained by Lee Keck

staked the team to a 7-0 lead.
However, UNC’s Byman pinned
Jim Crytzer (142), and the Tar

Basketball team loses 3

By BILL AUSTIN &
BILL FLESHER
scores:

W&L 63—Madison 76

W&L 68—Roanoke 91

W&L 73—Randolph-Macon 81

Entering the most treacherous
portion of its schedule, the Wash-
ington and Lee University basket-
ball team found out once more
what it is to lose.

In this past week, the first
two contests were not close, the
leads not held and then relin-
guished, Rather, these were games

that found W&L’s current edi-
tion outsized, outgunned. They

pointedly demonstrated the seri-
ousness of the of center
Norm Kristoff and his board
strength. Yet, against Randolph-
Macon, the Generals put forth a
remarkable effort, nearly knock-
ing off the state’s winningest
team.

loss

The Madison affair, played in
Harrisonburg before the search-
ing cameras of UHF channel 51,
had the Generals down from the
yutset. To be sure, the game was
one of the team’s lesser achieve-
ments of the season, particularly
the first-half showing. In it, W&L
shooters canned but 9 of 33 field
goal attempts, for an icy 27.2%.
In contrast, Madison got good
scoring efforts from freshmen
Sherman Dillard and John Cad-
man to move to a 35-27 half-time
bulge.

The margin increased in the
final period, reaching 20 points
at one time, before Jeff Baum
entered the contest to spark a
W&L come-back. The 6’3” sopho-
more collected 8 points, and pull-
ed the Generals within 10 with
four minutes remaining. How-
ever, two baskets by Madison’s
Joe Frve cooled the frantic bid.

The 76-63 triumph for Madison
was led by Dillard’s 20 points and
Cadman’s 12. Freshman Van
Snowden and sophomore Wilbert
Mills collected 10 points apiece.

Skip Lichtfuss led the Generals
with 17 points. Three players, Bo
Williams, Guy Kerr, and Paul
Maloney, picked up nine each.
In the defeat, W&L retrieved but
30 rebounds as a team, compared
to 47 for Madison. Team shoot-
ing improved a little in the final
stanza, but the 32% field goal

mark was a seasonal low for the §

squad.
Saturday night’s return’ to
Doremus was a needed respite at

home. Or was it? Judging from %

the noise of the attending crowd,
the Generals were performing in
an alien setting. It sems that the
Roanoke College Maroons, surly,
confident and, incidentally,
fourteenth best college division
team in the land, invaded Lex-
ington with a bit of a following.

Indeed, a highly organized herd
of the Roanoke faithful trouped,
smug-faced, into fair Doremus,
equipped with cheer leaders and
snarling voices. They were not
like the Charlottesville crowd
that earlier flocked south to see
their Cavaliers play: those cock-
tail-circuit Washoos who _pleas-
antly exhorted their big-boys to
victory.

No, these were foot-stomping,
vociferous patrons of a dearly
loved team, ready to dispute every
call, to verbally denounce every
Wé&L player. Even the W&L
“Swing” seemed somewhat intimi-
dated by the gathering.

The intruders got their wish.
They saw Roanoke move out to
an early lead, despite General
efforts to slow things down and
Guy Kerr’s brilliant first-half per-
formance. Kerr poured in 10 of
the team’s first 12 points, 14 of
its half-time total of 26.

Nonetheless, the Maroons’ pun-
ishing brand of run and_ shoot
and shove basketball took its toll
on the smaller Generals. Roa-
noke’s formidable front line of
66” leader garnered numerous
