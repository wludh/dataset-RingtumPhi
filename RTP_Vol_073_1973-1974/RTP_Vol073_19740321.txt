Two students arrested

on charges of streaking

Last weekend two Washington
and Lee stuednts were arrested
for streaking by local authorities.

Bill T. Tiers, sophomore at
Washington and Lee, was arrest-
ed Friday night by Paul Smothers
of the Lexington Police Depart-
ment when he allegedly streaked
from his apartment down Main

Street. Tiers is out on bail at
this time.
Shortly after midnight last

Sunday John Keefe, also a sopho-
more here, Was arrested by Lex-
ington policeman Danny Moore
for allegedly streaking The Corner
Grill.
Keefe friend
around

streaked with a
through the restaurant

one o'clock a.m. Upon leaving the
establishment he was apprehend-
ed by police who chased him to
his room in Nelson House and
arrested him there. The officer
allowed Keefe to dress before he
was taken down to the station.
The second streaker was not
caught,

Keefe was charged with inde-
cent exposure and was released
on $35 bond within an hour of
his arrest. His trial has been set
for Tuesday, March 26, at 9:30
a.m,

Number 21

EC to retain
lawyer, debate
Honor System

By ROBERT PUGH

The EC voted Monday night to
retain a student body lawyer.

Thomas Spencer of the firm
Spencer and Crawford was retain-
ed to give legal advice to student
government organizations and
will address the students in three
of four talks. The retainer is $200,
and will extend for a one year
period.

Additionally, the EC is looking
into the feasibility of a prepaid
legal system, in which students
would receive legal advice. The
Legal Research Staff will investi-
gate the possibility for $50, as
will an EC-appointed committee.
The administration will be asked
to print a handbook of Virginia
laws especially relevant to stu:
dents. This would be used at next
vear’s freshman orientation.

Petitions were submited for
class offices (see separate article
for candidates). The election is
Monday, March 19, and the run-
off is Wednesday, March 21. Polis
are open from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m
in the Quad, Co-op, Washington
Hall, and law school. Tearing
down posters is a possible Stu-
dent Control violation.

Student Body President Doug
Schwartz said some students are
working on a proposal to have a
one-year suspension option for
honor violations. He vowed that
he would discuss the idea at
every EC meeting until the end
of the year. Schwartz wants 2
student referendum.

Some EC members questioned
the legality of such an idea, say-
ing that such a move could not
be made in this manner. They
thought the EC had the sole
jurisdiction over the honor sys-
tem, Senior Lewis Powell specu-
lated that the by-laws of the uni.
versity could be interpreted in
such a way that only the trustees

could remove the penalty. The
matter will be discussed next
week.

Mike Brittin, Student Activities
Board Chairman, said his group
is presently working on Spring
Weekend, April 26-27. They are
also providing buses for out-of-
town lacrosse games. He said
Fancy Dress cost less than $1500

Brittin called attention to the
Outing Club’s activities, citing
their planting of 3,000 trees at a
nearby lake.

John Killpack reported for his
poster regulations committee (see
separate article for listing of
regulations). The rules take effect
at the beginning of the spring
term.
THE RING-TUM PHI

OUTLOOK and REVIEW!
A letter FROM the editor

Going over the Ring-tum Phi’s budget last Monday with the
Executive Committee, president Doug Schwartz asked me a simple
yet seemingly unanswerable question.

Is the Ring-tum Phi worth what the students pay for it?

As a point of information, the student tax allocation to the Phi
is some $4,000 this year. This amounts to just less than $3 per
undergraduate student. Law schoo] students, rather than paying
the Phi, pay for the tri-weekly Law News.

That amounts to a bit more than ten cents per Phi.

As a matter of contrast, each undergraduate pays about $4.97
for the student yearbook, the Calyx, a dollar for the student literary
magazine, the Ariel, $3 for Contact, about 69 cents for the Executive
Committee, and a sum for other various items. In addition, based
on next year’s $30 student body tax, students will pay approximately
$11 for the Student Activities Board, according to our estimates.

I know that students are at least picking up nearly all the 1300
copies of the Phi distributed on campus. But is everybody who picks
up a Phi, who pays through his student tax for the Phi, getting his
ten cents worth?

That is the job which was assigned to me upon my appointment
last year—to get people to read the Phi, to get their collective ten
cents worth. And as my regime slowly draws to a close (applications
for next year’s editor will be due in the spring term), I have to
look back and assess what the Phi has accomplished, whether the
Phi is worth what students pay for it, as Schwartz asked.

If success of the paper were measured by the number of enemies
I’ve made or the number of persons I’ve irritated this year,
then there’s no question about it—if that were so, then the Phi
was a roaring success. But that is a measure by which I cannot
calculate the Phi’s success, save perhaps on a certain level.

My problem just may be that I have failed to influence, to be
of interest beyond that aforementioned level—the level of those I
have “attacked” this year. That level is one of those in power, and
not, I fear, of the “common man” of the campus. Perhaps even now,
this column is being read only by those persons who are affiliated
with the campus “power structure.” Maybe those I should be trying
to reach aren’t even reading this. Perhaps the majority of this
campus, the majority which I should try to appease, doesn’t read
the editorials; perhaps the majority is only concerned with the sports
pages, or with what relatively little that is front page news in the
Phi.

I thought I indicated at the beginning of the schoo] year what
my position on this issue is. I said the Phi welcomed comments
and criticism of content in the Phi, and I most certainly welcomed
students to take an active role in writing for the Phi. And further-
more, I have all but begged students with opposing views to those
of the Phi to write letters to the editor. My one goal when I took
over as editor was to get diverse student input into the paper.
Perhaps it is there where I have failed.

The Phi was called “sophomoric” by one individual, “childish.”
Looking back at some of the articles run this past year, I would
have to agree as far as those specific articles are concerned. Then
why did I run those sophomoric articles? Because of lack of student
input, either through reporting for the Phi or writing letters to the
Phi.

I gladly would have disgarded those “childish” articles for a
reasonably sane letter, or any other kind of input, from students.
But little came.

1 gladly would run a paper full of letters to the editor, if their
content was of any substance whatsoever. I have tried to raise “the”
issues on this campus editorially; maybe I have. But apparently the
copy of the paper as a whole fails to raise issues. Perhaps more
student input would.

I have invited letters to the editor; hardly any have come,
particularly from those students who proclaim the childish and
sophomoric nature of the paper.

I thus return to where I began this editorial:

Is the Phi worth what students pay for it?

In terms of basic information and news, I think the Phi this
year has paid at least half its worth. The other half lies in the
other values of the Phi to its readers—whether it’s sophomoric,
whether it’s childish. I think the Phi, based on those values, is
well worth a dime a copy.

And, damn it, if you don’t agree with me, why don’t you get off
your ass and type up a letter to the editor for next week’s issue?

—P.J.L.

LETTERS TQ THE .

The role of the Phi

Sir:

I must preface this humble
offering with a formal declara-
tion of druthers. I druther ad-
dress my remarks to a dynamic
newspaper, staffed not only with
intrepid journalists but with
plump, juicy coeds to temper the
desires of those resolute report-
ers. (I do not mean exchange
students or transfer students,
gentlemen; I actually meant co-
eds: the real, live kind envisioned
by such semanticists as Messrs.
Merriam, Webster, and Barnhart.)

However, I must not ask for
too much too soon, For, I’m
afraid, doing so would undoubt-
edly leave me unprotected against
charges of lazy cynicism or other
insolent behavior. Therefore I
shall keep dreaming, and (excuse
me but I feel I do have the
right to keep) bitching.

It is my honest hope that the
staff of the Phi will not take
insult at any of this for none
is intended. Hell, I don’t really
know any of you anyway. But
throughout my four year stretch
at W&L, I’ve overheard many
nasty comments in contents of
your paper, and I for one think
the time has come to cease the
spread of such rumblings behind
your backs. (I hate to depart
from my dear mother’s advice
this late in fe, but IT Save
nothing nice ot say and I’m not
about to shut up.)

Charges have been raised,
quite fairly I think with respect
to any controversial issues, that
the campus organ is relatively
impotent. Is this because the
Ring-tum Phi is no more able
than a circus mirror to reflect
the realm of student life in Lex-
ington? Quite possibly. I have
read more than one too many
articles on “What-there-is-to-do-in-
Lexington.”

There is an _ unquestionable
need, due to our rather unique
environment, to move beyond
traditional journalistic patterns.
Granted the Phi covered last
year’s bust sensationally; poorly
but sensationally, and you were
there in force at the Mock Con-
vention. Fortunately so was
everyone else. And you printed a
nice, paternalistic, and psychia-

trically amateurish letter to some
poor guy who was feeling pretty
depressed after this years sui-
cide, providing him with a list
of wise men for consultation. I
honestly could not figure out why
the campus hippies and the W&L
groundskeepers were left off the
list. They too are capable of un-
fathomable wisdom.

Presumably those who have
taken time to read this are, by
now, breathlessly awaiting my
officious proposals ,armed to the
hilt with vengeful criticism. If
this be so gentlemen, kindly go
back to sleep. For I would just
like to ask a few questions in
a rather thinly disguised attempt
to transform a few of the Phi’s
columns into an arena where the
only gladiators are ideas or re-
actions, equipped with nothing
more dangerous than a_ type-
writer.

For example, why do the em-
ployees of City Hall regard us
with such contempt? Why do
they think that W&L and VMI
are meddling in town business?
Why is there a drug policy for
freshman only? Why are the
communications between the
school and the legal community
(Sisler and Co.) so damned in-
efficient and uniformative? What
happened to coeducation? What’s
with Hank Koci? Will we get a
Fine Arts building and if not,
why not? Why doesn’t somebody
fire Dick Miller? (Even the town
cops think he’s weird!)

Gentlemen, the time has come
for all good men to put their
piles together. I suggest that we
must all be fairly talented souls
or we wouldn’t be here to begin
with. I also suggest most audaci-
ously that such talent can re-
store the Phi to its award-winning
tradition. If not for our own sake,
then for the sake of our poor
parents (for God’s sake they must
read it too). And if not for our
parents, then for our’ unborn
sons, the Generals of the future
who may innocently ask, “Gee
daddy, is it true that people back
in the 70’s didn’t even know on
which days the Phi was circul-
ated? Didn’t anybody read it?”
Let’s hope that you can proudly
tell junior that you and your
compatriots rescued the Phi from

lowing of cattle was the only thing able to put me to sleep, I
chose to work on my uncle’s dairy farm instead of going to
college. It wasn’t a bad life, really. And in my spare time I
coached a promising young Guernsey to moo “Away in the
Manger” under my window at night. Unfortunately, the comedy
impersonations she insisted on doing as well, especially the one
of Ed Sullivan introducing the Beatles, kept me awake and in
the end she had to go. I followed suit and enrolled at Washington
and Lee, where the talented Guernsey reappeared at a banquet
dinner as the main dish. (It must have been her because I was
asleep before the after dinner speeches began!).

Washington and Lee I found to be an engaging place, “a bastion

 

of higher learning and a bailiwick of recreation.” I read that in

a brochure sent mistakenly by the University, which turned
out to be about some dude ranch for Spanish-American War vet-
erans in Arizona. Nevertheless, the description aptly applies to
W&L, though there were raised eyebrows when I first arrived
in Lexington bearing a desert survival kit, a Roosevelt poster,
and sixteen changes of underwear.

Certainly, with variation and challenge the W&L existence is
loaded, At least, the guest lecturer at the first seminar I attended
was loaded. His talk had been on Iberian culture and at the
reception afterwards he chased one of the deans with a fork,
shouting that he was about to plant the Portuguese flag in the
dean’s ribs and claim his appendix for Isabella or Ferdinand,
whichever one was at home. Of course, it didn’t happen quite
that way: it might have been a soup spoon, now that I think.
The point is that life at W&L is not uneventful and, except for
occasional nightmares in which Charlton Heston offers to recite
the entire book of Genesis backwards to a plumbers’ convention,
that life is pleasant. Professors take an active interest in the
student and, unless the student habitually wears striped ties with
plaid shirts or grows asparagus for profit in his window sill,
hen the professors might even be persuaded to teach him....

architecture appeals, the distant girl schools beckon, the com-
munity thrives and the local A&P stocks Ben Franklin cigars. What
else can there possibly be?

A—Ha, ha. Good impersonation of a freshman. Can you do a Guernsey

Information sought
Sir:

Sometime during the weekend
of March 8-11, someone staved
in the left tail fender (of what
is actually a monolithic unit) on
a 1969, green, two-door Nova.

It would be greatly appreciated
if the person responsible would
come forward. This happened in
the University lot directly across
from the University Cleaners.
Anyone having information
about this could contact me at
the address listed in the student
directory.

As this car is not by own
property, this incident poses some
peculiar difficulties. (In addition,

there is no collision insurance on
the car.)

At a time when this student is
becoming less disenchanted with
the University, it would be nice
if the image of a _ responsible
student body could be impressed
further upon him, Thanks.

Outside-In

By W. PATRICK HINELY
Hmmm....so this is the “entertainment” column which I was
asked to write this week for academically vacationing-from-Phi-writ-
ing Rome Scott.

OK, the Lexington entertainment scene in a word: slim. The
best—and cheapest—movies around show at the school, anyway. You
can get a full schedule of them from the news service office in
Washington Annex; the flick listings are incorporated into the weekly
calendar. As for the tube, well, I was in a restaurant in Buena Vista
the other night (don’t ask me how or why I got there), and saw one
of those “gag” postcards, usually reserved for hickish homilies,
which pretty well summed up the state of television today. It said
anyone who has half a mind to stay home evenings and watch TV
is probably well equipped to do so. Or as Uncle Hick once said in
an old Rolling Stone interview with Nicholas Johnson, “Cable TV?
Hell no, I don’t want it. I have to pay to get the garbage hauled out.”

So much for that. With exams coming up, inevitably, some quieter,
self-pacing entertainment might be more in order. If you’re not into
yoga, the next best thing is probablv reading, so herewith are some
book reviews.

Fear and Loathing: On the Campaign Trail ‘72
Dr. Hunter S. Thompson

illustrated by Ralph Steadman

Popular Library, New York. paperback $1.75

This is by far the best example of “new” journalism to come along
for years. Thompson breaks all the rules of conventional] journalism
by becoming both openly biased and pretty completely involved in
the subject he is covering, and through all this is able to relate the
process of the 1972 election through the eves of a participant as well
as of a spectator.

Originally published in bi-weekly segments for the Rolling Stone,
these former columns come together strongly as a book, reinforcing
vell the feelings most of us have had about American politics all
along. His exposes on Ed Muskie’s drug habits and fantasies rank
second in hilariosity only to the McGovern camp’s careful orchestra-
tions at the Democratic Convention. Alas, Thompson doesn’t even
mention W&L’s Mock Convention, but then, he’s concerned with men
playing the real game of politics, not college boys on politica] fantasy
trips.

Thompson's account of joining a “spontaneous demonstration” for
Nixon at the GOP convention may rank as one of the most outrage-
ous pieces of journalism-of-the-absurd ever written. He did it wear-
ing a press badge and a McGovern button, but he came on to those
parbie-doll mannequins so strong that he had them believing John
‘Chancellor of NBC news played tricks on his friends by putting LSD
in their martinis.

If you were (are) a McGovern supporter, you will understand
well the progression toward pessimism and resignation to ugly facts
the book takes as it approaches the crucial night in November. His
imagery is so strong that it still makes my bile rise when I think
about GOP headquarters just here in little old Lexington that night.

There is no optimistic spacey kind of essay to wind up this account
£ one of the most successful con-jobs on the American people in our
history. It leaves us hanging just where we are, and where Nixon is
keeping us—balanced precariously between being the saviour angel
or the Satan of this planet.

Actually, this might be better reading for vacation than for exam
breaks, since it’s hard to stop reading it once you start. It kept me

Culture is Our Business
Marshall McLuhan
Ballantine Books, New York. paperback $3.95

What we have here is one of the few social commentary-books as
much at four vears old which is still worth reading in our increas-
ingly changing times. McLuhan, who is usually either blessed or
cursed by his readers and critics, with few taking any middle ground,
takes on directly for the first time since the early ’50’s what he con-
siders, rightly so, to be the foremost American art form: advertising.

In keeping with the literary devices he worked up so artfully in
his earlier works, Culture is Our Business elevates the pun even
farther from its supposed position as a low form of humor. It be-
comes a means of transmitting ideas which would otherwise be lost
in esoteric-academic jargon.

McLuhan sees our society from the coveted position of an inside-
outsider, or outside-insider, depending on your perspective. He has
no point of view, for a point, in his terms, is no longer valid. It
connotes stability and constancy, two things impossible for anyone
but a hermit in the 1970's.

He has somewhat of a hangup on James Joyce, especially
Finnegan's Wake. Assuming Joyce was the godlike thinker McLuhan
holds him up to be, Culture is Our Business is a logical extension of
the ideas put forth in Joyce. If you are one who sees Joyce as an
incoherent hack attempting to masquerade as an artist, the book
nevertheless says some important things about the way America
functions.

The role of the artist is society is one of McLuhan’s main em-
phasis. He sees most advertising as feedback, that is, trying to put
proven successful ideas into people’s heads to sell things. The artist,
on the other hand, is concerned with creating intuitive works, i.e.,
new ideas, which McLuhan calls feedforward.

The interaction of Eastern and Western cultures on one another
is discussed in unusually cosmic tearms for a non-mystical-religious
writer. McLuhan has somehow managed to maintain a meaningful
perspective on out culture, and what he has to say is worth reading.

The book is structurally segmented into conveniently short chap-
ters which lend themselves well to reading one at a time, which is
about as much as you can take at one sitting, anyway, if you're
going to get anything from reading it. He’s the kind of writer who
puts out about 90% new material, as opposed to the average book’s
to to 20%, so it takes a little longer to digest it well. But it’s worth it.
Last but not least:

Stories of Five Decades
Hermann Hesse
Noonday Press, New York. paperback $2.95

Here, for the first time in paperback, are the collected short
stories of one of the original 20th century heavies. There are 23
stories, ranging in length from 2 to 36 pages each, and each one a
little gem in itself. Hesse could work within many contexts, and
handle each one quite capably. The shorter ones are good for a short
study break, or even for sitting on the john. The longer ones might
be good for bedtime reading, or the book as a whole would be the
perfect thing to have on a beach at spring vacation.

All I can say about the book as a whole is that you'll like it if
you liked his novels.

Professor investigates brain behavior

New clues to behavior — which
might provide science with some
of the important answers to dis-
orders such as epilepsy, com-
pulsive eating and hyperactivity
—imay result from research being
conducted by Washington and
Lee psychology professor Leon-
ard E, Jarrard on a small, sea-
horse-shaped section of the brain
called the hippocampus.

His investigations have indicat-
ed that the hippocampus is di-
rectly involved in motivation, the

basis for patterns of sleeping,
eating, drinking and _ certain
other animal] activity. The evid-
ence is, Jarrard says, that it
servese to inhibit or control
spontaneous’ activity, hunger,

thirst, and perhaps “exploratory”
behavior in new surroundings.

He is cautious about drawing
conclusions, but observes that the
hippocampus, through malfunc-
tions in this “regulatory” or
“modulating” role, may be a key
to the causes of certain specific
kinds of erratic behavior.

duction, “Phe Drunkard.” The play is a moral domestic melodrama adapted

Experimental manipulations of
various areas of the hippocampus,
conducted in research extending

over more than a decade, have
produced significant alterations

 

of behavior patterns
in eating and drinking.

Rats have been used in most
of Jarrard’s research, though
from time to time he has also

worked with monkeys, and other
neuroscientists have used cats in
hippocampus studies. While the
experimental techniques of vari-
ous researchers have not always
been comparable, he says, the
evidence is clear that certain
basic functions are the same from
species to species.

One significant difference in
man, however, Jarrard notes, is
that his hippocampus appears to
be directly involved with retain-
ing verbal knowledge—though, of
course, the data on humans come

from naturally caused or acci-
dental damage to the _  hippo-
campus, not from controlled

scientific manipulation.

Klis, the Loafer, in

the

Early in Jarrard’s work with
the hippocampus, he determined
that it is not, as scientists had
believed, a “unitary”
structure with a single function—
but rather that various areas or
“fields” influenced different acti-
vities. For example, Jarrard has
discovered, drinking in rats in-
creases significantly when cer-
tain cell fields are stimulated by
chemicals or electrical shock—or

earlier

removed altogether—but is un-
affected by identical manipula-

tion of other fields. Various com-
binations of stimulus, both in-
ternal and external, have pro-
duced other major changes in
normal activity and response.

Jarrard’s interest in the hippo-
campus developed early in the
1960s, when scientists began to
understand the connection _be-
tween disorders in the _ hippo-
campus and extraordinary physi-
cal activity—such as_ epilepsy.
When drugs fail, epilepsy can be
controlled by surgical removal of
damaged hippocampal _ tissue.

tabies, too, seems to center in
the hippocampus, affecting the
victim by causing degeneration of
the structure.

After several years of teaching
at Washington and Lee and in-
vestigating the hippocampus, Jar-
rard left for a spell at Carnegie-
Mellon University in Pittsburgh,
where he continued his research.
After two vears there he was
named chairman of Carnegie
Tech’s graduate psychology pro-
gram.

But, he admits, before long he
began to miss Washington and
Lee’s teaching orientation and its
blend with the chance to carry
out substantial scientific research.
So in 1971 he returend to W&L.

His experimental procedures
are exacting and complex. Pre-
cise data have to be developed
on cells and nerve connections
even before experimentation on

specimen rats can begin — in
effect, maps in intricate detail
which permit even the most

microscopic nerve to be traced
within the fields of hippocampus
and through the brain to its
termination in another structure.

Surgery and other experimental
manipulations, of course, require
equally careful attention. He uses
mazes, feeding and drinking sta-
tions with advanced automatic
measuring and recording equip-
ment, and similar laboratory de-
vices to chronicle activity with
minute precision.

Behavior can then be analyzed
for patterns of frequency and
sequence in 15-second time seg-
ments, using special computer
programs which detect deviations
from “normal” activity, which
can be determined by subject-
ing ‘control” rats in which the
hippocampus has not been mani-
pulated to identical stimuli.

Since 1966 Jarrard’s research
has been supported by the Na-
tional Science Foundation under
three major grants totaling $147,-
950. He is aided in his work by
a full-time laboratory technician,
Mrs. Maria Hunt, and two Wash-
ington and Lee undergraduate

Stickmen lose, face Navy

By BILL FLESHER
\ashington and Lee’s lacrosse
Generals approached last week’s
exhibition game with the Mount
Washington Lacrosse Club dif-
ferently than they had in years

ist.

Today, Jack Emmer wonders if
he made the right decision.

“Usually we go up there for ex-
perience—if we win, fine, if not,
we have gained a lot of ex-
perience,” Emmer said of the old
way of approaching the Mt. Wash-

ington game.

“This year, however, we took
a risk and went up to win. We
emphasized this game even
though we had the big game of
our early season with Navy com-
ing up the next week.”

As it turned out, the Generals
lost the gamble.

Playing in a steady rain, W&L’s
running attack was slowed con-
siderably, and they were unable
to stop the Wolfpack’s veteran
midfielders, who scored 11 of the
12 goals which gave Mt. Washing-
ton a 12-7 win.

“We got beat by a bunch of
smart shooters who took advant-
age of some excellent screens on
our goalie and of the wet condi-
tions to keep the game in their
attacking zone,’ Emmer said.

“We didn’t play well on the
whole, though there were some
bright spots,” he added. “Our
close defense was excellent, as
Mt. Washington’s attack scored
only one goal, and on that one
our defenseman (Tom Keigler)
slipped in the mud, allowing (Vir-
ginia alumnus) Rick Bergland to
go in alone.” Emmer pointed to
the 0 for 10 performance in extra
man situations as a factor in the
final outcome.

“We expect to score at least
40 per cent of the time when we
are a man up,” Emmer said. “But
when you don’t put the ball into
the net in the extra man, you
aren’t going to win many games.”

Emmer now wonders if his
troops, especially the younger
players can bounce back from the
loss for this week’s clash with
Navy.

“We can’t feel sorry for our-
selves for the mistakes we made
last week,” Emmer said. “I know
our veteran players can come
back, but can our young guys do
the same thing?”

“I saw some good work from
our freshmen last week, but they
now must take some of the load
themselves. Too often they are
looking for (Ted) Bauer, (Skip)

Lichtfuss, and (Bryan) Chasney,
and, when these guys have a bad
game, we need our younger
players to take up some of the
slack. They haven't done this yet,
and I hope they will soon.”

For Emmer, this week wouldn’t
be to soon, as the Generals will
be facing a Navy team which will
be out to avenge last year’s 13-12
sudden death loss to W&L in the
NCAA quarterfinals.

“Phey | be sey Kigh=for us,
there’s no question about that.”
Emmer said. “Navy has looked
good early, but we question how
they will react in a close game.”

The Middies, coached by former
W&L mentor Dick Szlasa, thump-
ed Dartmouth 23-4 in their sea-
son opener. They took on the
University of Maryland-Baltimore
County yesterday.

Key personnel for Navy are
Dave Bayly on attack, Marty Ma-
son at the midfield (Mason last
vear played attack), John Lawlor
on defense, and Ray Finnegan in
goal,

“If there’s any weakness it
could be in the defense,’ Emmer
said. “They lost two of their
starting defensement from last
year, and we will be the first
team to really test their new de-
fensemen.”

Saturday’s game in Annapolis,
Md. begins at one p.m.

Lichtfuss receives several
post-season honors

Senior Skip Lichtfuss, W&L’s
leading basketball scorer for the

number of post-season honors.

Lichtfuss has been named to

Wa&L wins

By BILL AUSTIN

W&L’s baseball fortunes for
the entire spring season may have
been encompassed in the pair of
games played this past Friday
and Monday afternoon.

When the pitching is there,
as it was in the efforts of Rod
Ferrandino, and Dan Westbrook,
the Generals field a competative
bunch. To be sure, this is no
club of long-ball prowess.

Of the eight hits mustered in
the opening two contests, two
were of the extra-base variety:
a double and a homerun. Both
were Don Hathway’s. Yet, for at

March 21

least two games, modest talents
at the plate were more than off-
set by strong-armed, intelligent
moundsmen.

Friday’s affair brought to Lex-
ington an ornately-attired bunch
from the West Virginia Institute
of Technology. W. Va.’s_ starting
hurler, Staites, kept W&L hitters
in check with a rising fastball
and a touch of unsettling wild-
ness, living up but three hits in
his six-inning stint. However, the
sixth proved his undoing.

Ben Bonaventura whiffed to
open the inning, but Don Hath-
way smacked a drive to right-
center, good for a_ stand-up
double. Al Burton walked, as did

Break up the Law School!

That seems to be the predomi-
nant cry of many of the fraterni-
ties in the intramural league this
year. The “legal eagles” of Wash-
ington and Lee have organized
themselves into a_ formidable
force to be reckoned with in com-
parison to their spastic lethargy
of vears past.

This organization has been re-
sponsible for five first place
finishes in intramural sports this
year, most recently the bowling
trophy, and the handball trophy.
Bev Wood, the Law School’s in-
tramural man-behind-the-scenes,
attributes this year’s success to a
fine job of recruiting, and their
“team” approach to the sports. As
of now, the Law School has a-
massed 689 points, with Phi
Kappa Sigma a close second with
668 points, making this year’s
race for the I-M crown both very
close and very interesting.

There is one week left in I-M
Basketball, with only two of the
league titles clinched, as of Mon-
day night. The Betas and the
SAE’s are probable winners if
they win their remaining games
against the weaker teams in their

  
 
  
 

leagues. The Law School and
Sigma Chi are battling for a play-
off spot in their league, and the
Delts and SABU are neck-and-
neck also.

The biggest game of the I-M
season will take place on Monday
night at 9:30 when SABU and
DTD play for the second time
this year. In the first exciting
contest, the Delts won by two
points in overtime, after SABU
came back from a deficit of 15
points in the second half.

A Eugene Perry bomb with 10
seconds left sent the game into
the extra period, and the superior
foul shooting of the Delts won the
game. For his efforts in this and
an earlier win against LCA, Tony
Perry was named Player of the
Week for his 42 points that week
and many rebounds. Other win-

Dave Otey after John Rice had
popped up to short. Tech’s Staites
bore down, getting Ray Rheault
to tap a roller between the plate
and the mound. However, in his
hurry to nab Rheault at first
base, Staites tossed the ball into
right field. Three runs came home
because of the miscue. Chip
Costello followed with a strike
out, but Straites was through for
the afternoon.

The tallies gave junior pitcher
Rod Ferrandino al) the fire-power
he needed, and then some. In
truth, he hurled a _ masterful
game, and was never in serious
trouble in any of his nine innings
of labor. He yielded only five
hits, and walked but one. He
struck out 10 W. Va. foes, five in
the final three innings.

William and ‘Mary came to town
Monday to test the arm of Dan
Westbrook, a freshman starting
the initial game of what promises
to be a notable college career.
Yet, in the first inning, his start
looked anything but hopeful.
Westbrook walked the Indians’
left fielder, Bush, and then, with
two outs registered, fired bail
four past the designated hitter,
Kenner, and the W&L catcher.
When A! Burton finally retrieved
Bush had score from
second.

The 1-0 W&M lead held until
the fifth, when General DH Tom
Lancaster sent a _ ground-ball
single up the middle, stole second
base, and scooted to third on a
passed ball. A bungled grounder
slapped by Ben ‘Bonaventure
scored Lancaster, and knotted the
game at 1-1.

W&M’s left-hander, Framer,
began to tire noticeably in the
sixth inning and General bats
feasted off his hanging curves, Al

Burton led off things with a
single to left, to be joined on
the base paths when Framer

handled an Otey bunt and th
wildly to second, nabbing no one.
John Rice’s perfect bunt loaded
the bases. Costello then lashed a
line drive to left field that seem-
ed destined for extra bases, Dut
Indian’s Bush made a remark-
able grab, culminating the feat
with a neatly performed be *‘y-
slide.

The play surely robbed Coste lo
of three RBIs. Burton scored on
Ray Rheault’s sacrifice fly. Then,
with John Rice caught off first
base in a run-down, Dave Otey
managed to scamper homeward
before W&M chased the a-ert
Rice down for the final out.

The 3-1 bulge grew when Hath-
way launched a_ fence-clearing
home run to left in the bottom
of the eighth. In addition, Otey
walked and scored on a subse-
quent throwing error.

For Westbrook, the day which
began with a baptism of pressure
ended in victory. Going the dist-
ance, he gave up only one hit—
a seventh-inning single by the
Indians’ catcher, Slavin. Though
he walked five batters and hit
another, the freshman exhibited
an assortment of pitches that kept
W&M off balance throughout the
contest.

Of note in both wins was the
fine fielding exhibited by Ben
Bonaventura, the freshman short-
stop whose range and throwing
arm seem impressive tools for
the task of supplying W&L’s in-
field with the stability it re-
quires. Third sacker Otey and
second baseman Higgins also put
forth creditable efforts.

The Generals travel coastward
for double-headers with Appren-
tice College and Old Dominion
University on this coming Satur-
day and Monday. The next home
game features Hampden-Sydney
College on Thursday, March 23,
at 3 p.m.
