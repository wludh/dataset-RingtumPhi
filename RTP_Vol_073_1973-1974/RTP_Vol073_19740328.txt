Honor system change wanted

By ROBERT PUGH

A majority of students survey-
ed are against the absolute pen-
alty.

This was a conclusion of the
honor system questionnaire, to
which about 40% of the student
body (644 people) responded. 58%
of the people oppose the penalty.
Of these, 36% favor a 1-year sus-
pension, while the rest favor vari-
ous lesser penalties.

36% of the students surveyed
know of an honor violation or
know someone who has knowl-
edge of one. A large majority,
94%, favor continued existence
of the honor system.

In other questions, 67% feel
that the honor system should
have geographical limitations;
65% of these feel that the limit
should be “any location of a
university-related function.” 82%
fee] that the system should ap-
ply to more than academic mat-
ters. 67% are against codification
of violations. 75% prefer the re-
cently introduced idea of a stu-
dent suspecting a violation con-
fronting the suspect before he
calls in the EC. Although 55%
feel that there is a reluctance to

Fire damages
apartments
in Lexington

A fire caused by the short-cir-
cuiting of an electrical appliance
was blamed for a fire Tuesday
night in a four-student apartment
in Lexington.

The fire broke out in the bed-
yoom of Richard K. Stuart in his
apartment at 101 McLaughlin.
The fire destroyed the bedroom,
but Lexington firemen contained
the fire before it could spread.
There were no injuries.

Other students in the apart-
ment are William R. LaRosa, J.
M. Duckworth, and Charles R.
McCardell. The apartment sus-
tained heavy smoke and water
damage. Firemen made no esti-
mate of the damage.

Smoke spread to other parts
of the building, causing damage
in a number of rooms including
those of another four student
apartment in the house.

report violations right now, 60%
think the system works effectiv-
ely. 59% think that the reluct-
ance would be lessened by gradu-
ated penalties.

The EC Monday decided to
submit a second, shorter poll to
the students during the spring
term. A subcommittee has been
set up and is chaired by senior
EC rep Lewis Powell to study

possible ways of reaching maxi-
mum number of students.

The EC discussed releasing
tapes and transcripts to the ac-
cused after a private hearing. He
presently receives copies if he
goes to public trial. The discus-
sion was centered around whether
or not he should get them if
he declines to appeal. The Com-
mittee decided he should not.

It was also decided that a saf-
ety deposit box would be rented
to handle recent honor system
records. Older files, which date
back to the 1850s, will be stored
elsewhere.

The EC requests that anyone
with knowledge of the where-
abouts of Bill Merrill please get
in touch with an EC member.

Honor: black and white and gray

Results of the Honor System poll released this week indicate the
student body does not favor the current Honor System structure.

Specifically, 58 percent of those responding said they do not favor
retaining the absolute penalty as the punishment for the crime of
dishonor, And, 36 percent said they knew of a possible honor viola-
tion, but they didn’t report it. Cognate to this was the response
of 55 percent of the students who said they feel there is a reluctance
to report possible honor violations because of the absolute penalty.

Additionally, 59 percent said their would be less inhibition over
reporting an honor violation if the absolute penalty system were
replaced. Consequent to all this, 34 percent said they felt the Honor
System isn’t working.

What we would like to address ourselves to particularly is the
Honor System's “absolute penalty.” As we hope every student realizes,
anyone found guilty of an honor violation is subject to the absolute
penalty—he is kicked out of Washington and Lee for good.

Either the student has debased the university through an honor
violation, or he has not. Either he is kicked out or he stays. Black,
or non-black.

No, it is not a case of black and white, for there is no gray
area in-between. There is no buffer between a student’s snow-white
purity and his coal-black evil; there is no gray area of doubt, no
gray area of not-so-evil guilt.

The black and non-black Honor System used to work well at
Washington and Lee. Honor was a bit more clearly defined in those
days. You were honorable, or you weren’t. Any student had no
qualms about getting you out of the university if you weren't.

The black and non-black Honor System worked well in its time.

But times have changed.

No longer is the black and non-black Honor System capable of
maintaining honor at Washington and Lee. At least it isn’t capable
of maintaining honor as our predecessors at this school saw it.

Is honor maintained when students feel the punishment is so

harsh that they won't report possible honor violations?

It is the student who views a possible honor violation—he is the
one who administers the Honor System in truth. Whether the Honor
System is administered rests on whether he even reports the possible
violation. If he doesn’t report it, the Honor System is not administ-
ered, and honor at Washington and Lee takes a downward turn.

And even if he does report it, it still may be up to the students—
via a public honor trial—to determine whether the Honor System is
administered.

If a student clearly commits what is deemed an honor violation—
say he steals an ash tray, for example—and the students feel the
punishment (expulsion from Washington and Lee) is too harsh for
the crime, then those students fail to convict that individual student
of an obvious violation.

As with the case of a student who doesn’t even report a possible
honor violation, where does honor stand then?

We feel honor stands all the worse when the means detract from
the gaining of the ends. And in the current Honor System, the means
(the absolute penalty) surely detract this schoo] from gaining its
ends (honor).

Among the possible solutions to this problem—a one year suspen-
sion from Washington and Lee along with permanent expulsion.
Which punishment to be used would be determined by the persons
trying the student, be they the EC or the student jury of a public
honor trail. Among the criteria determining which punishment should
be used: type and severity of crime; consequences of crime; and pos-
sibly attitude and actions of the convicted students during the course
of an honor investigation of him.

If the students won’t administer the Honor System, then it doesn’t
matter much what the EC’s power to try individuals is, or what the
Board of Trustees’ power to delineate the scope and substance of
the Honor System is. It is the student body which ultimately defends
honor at Washington and Lee, and adjustments in the Honor System
must be made to ensure that the student body wants to defend honor.

And for the students, it is no longer a case of black and non-
plack; it is a case of black and white and gray.

EUTERS TO Th

White’s stand supported

Sir:

I am writing this letter in re-
sponse to that of Eric D. White
and to your comment following
it.

I first would like to say that
I agree whole heartedly with what
Mr. White has said. I will not at-
tempt to even paraphrase this
because I could not do it justice;
so I simply suggest that anyone
who might have missed it (prob-
ably 50 percent of the student
body) find a copy and read it.

Secondly, I both agree and dis-
agree with your second comment
on Mr. White’s letter. Obviously,
much more talent is needed on
the Phi and someone with Mr.
White’s talent is sorely needed.
However, I am afraid that I feel
his talent would be wasted on the
Phi’s staff. Hopefully, he will con-
tinue to write to the Phi, but he
belongs on the EC.

John S. Wallace ’74

Fditor’s note: You're prob-
ably right — he would be wast-
ing his time. Because if he were
on the staff, he’d have to spend
half his time typing up letters
(such as yours) to the editor
that the writer couldn’t take
time to type himself. Now, if
we didn’t have to spend time
typing these letters, we’d have
that much more time to try to
improve our editing.

White’s stand opposed

Sir:

Here is my vote of confidence
and note of appreciation for the
job you have done as Editor-in-
Chief of the Phi during your
period of management.

Naturally, vou have upset some
people, particularly among those
in “power.” That’s what the press
is all about. Your editorials have
provided intelligent insight into
the working of our student gov-
ernment. You have witnessed
their procedings, and then on
your editorial page, have relayed
your feelings and questions on
their actions to us. And we, in
turn, have been remiss in answer-
ing or questioning both you and
the student government’s actions.

As far as other happenings that
might be considered “news,” with
the limited staff of reporters a-
vailable to you, the job has been
acceptable. Not every story or
feature has been profound, but
then you can’t be expected to pub-
lish something all the time that
will be pleasing to everyone.

In reading the March 21, 1974
issue of the Phi, a funny thing
happened to me on the way to
page 3. I began reading a letter
to the editor, which turned out
to be a vitriolic attack on the
job you and your staff have done.
It was signed by Eric D. White.
That name sounded familiar and
sure enough, I found it on page
one listed as a candidate for
Senior EC. The Student Directory
listed only one Eric D. White, so
I felt safe in assuming that the

letter writer and political candi-
date were one and the same.

I though it somewhat strange
that the man of undecided class
and possessing a fairly talented
soul should wait until near the
end of his four-year stretch to
make his voice heard in our
campus marketplace of ideas. But
then, perhaps this strategically
timed and place letter in the issue
before the elections could be a
plea for recognition. And it’s not
so strange that a candidate for
office should issue such an attack
against the media.

And, Mr. Editor, your answer
to this attack was excellent.
Perhaps if he wants investigative
reporting necessary fo rthe kind
of stories to which he refers, he
should accept your invitation.
And further, if he is unsuccessful
in being elected to the EC and
returns to school next year, per-
haps he should submit his name
for consideration for next year’s
editor of the Phi. Then maybe
he could staff the Phi with re-
porters of the calibre of Bern-
stein and Woodward. I imagine
that he would find the same situa-
tion that you have found, how-
ever. And I imagine he would
end up writing a Letter FROM
the Editor, such as yours.

If the idea of managing the Phi
doesn’t appeal to him, why not
offer the Phi competition and see
if he could do a better job. Open
an underground newspaper! Then
he could take the time from his
studies necessary for complete
coverage of exactly what has hap-
pened to Hank Koci. Take the
time necessary to completely in-
vestigate and report the “whole
story,” and not just areas in
which gossip-mongers might take
interest. And he should be care-
ful not to let his own personal
feelings permeate the handling
of his suggested firing of Dick
Miller. His irresponsible _ state-
ments against a faculty member
should be backed by by sub-
stantial] and substantive reasons,
which I feel certain, are non-
existent.

He might find pungent critic-
ism much easier to dispense than
the energy and talent necessary
for innovation, creative journal-
ism and improvement.

If he is really concerned about
the reactions of our children to
the Phi of the 70’s, let him send
his checks and earmark them for
journalistic endeavors after he
graduates. Money is always a pow-
erful tool against mediocrity.

Finally, his reference to “a nice,
paternalistic, and psychiatrically
amateurish letter to some poor
guy who was depressed after this
year’s suicide” was disappointing.
Compassion for our fellow men
should not be taken lightly. Life
has become too commercial and
de-personalized.

Rather than belittling such a
constructive effort by these folks
with such crude synicism, he
should applaud them, wish them
every success and even offer his
own talents. If this is unaccept-

Ask Traveller

Q—Are there any ghosts in Lexington?

   

A—Yes, although many of them prefer to remain anonymous for tax
purposes. As you may recall, the town of Lexington was originally
layed out back in the days when a belief in the supernatural was
as socially acceptable as is placing an obscene phone call in the
Jerry Lewis Telethon today. Consequently, all the fashionable
eighteenth century families in Lexington invited local representa-
tives of the demon’s club to their social gatherings, though hob-
goblins were notoriously poor charades players and often threw
loud tantrums upon missing a clue. Gradually, this practice died
out when whist came into favor.

Here, today, in the many antebellum houses around town, an-
cestral ghosts quietly haunt their former homes, and are regarded
by their living descendents with filial pride and affection, although
occassional family disputes arise over who gets the bathroom first
in the morning. These phantoms are as much a part of the house-
hold as the antique furniture and will often balance centerpieces
and candlesticks on their heads for great lengths of time to fool
dinner guests. Indeed, these family spooks have enlivened
many a dull alumni party with their incorporeal antics, eccentric
behavior, and an uncanny ability to win at Scrabble.

Of course, the many ghosts of Lexington do not limit their
nocturnal activities to old houses alone. Some roam the back
streets looking for odd jobs, while the more adventuresome ones,
will go around ringing doorbells and then, after posing as a
social worker, vanish suddenly before the eyes of horrified resi-
dents who have just agreed to support a starving Korean family
for $1 a month and all the back issues of Esquire they can read.
At the Southern Inn, the waitress reports a misty fellow appearing
each Thursday to order the businessman’s special only to disappear
before the Jello is served. “He’s probably embarrassed,” con-
jectured the waitress. “I notice he seems to have trouble picking
up his silverware and folding his napkin.” This is thought to
be the ghost of Hawg Sorrels, late postmaster of Lexington, who
was found dead one morning inside a registered package of lasagna
on its way, air express, to Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Foul play
was ruled out because the package had the correct postage on it.

Q—What do you say to a ghost if you meet one?

A—Oh, talk about the weather, or sports, general things. For heavens
sake, though, stay away from Dickens. Ghosts hate Dickens, He
never gave them any speaking parts, you know.

Q—How do you get rid of a ghost?
A—Offer him seconds on Jello.

THE RING-TUM PHI

Inside-Out

By ROME SCOTT
The Belly and What Comes After

Southern Seminary Junior College isn’t exactly Broadway but it
was the scene last week of an emotional and _ energy-packed
experience garbed in the guise of a play opening.

“The Belly and What Comes After,” written by Frederic Cook
and directed by Mrs. Ellen Barnes, is a hard, glaring examination
of the psychological defense mechanisms that social people use to
enter the games people play during a lifetime.

The setting is the inside of the belly of a beast, perhaps the beast
of social abuse, where the play begins with children’s games.

The auditorium is lined with a black plastic that gives an impres-
sion of isolation, the feeling the main character, “White,” has while
undergoing the trials of coping with society.

All the characters have color names corresponding to the colors
of the costumes.

This anonimity and the absence of scenery forces the audience to
focus on the action which is constantly confusing, never crystalizing
any specific message.

“White” is put through a trial by the other colors and made bo
explain his case for existence as a member of the American govern-
ment. He attempts to appease the jury with a series of stories put
forth the same way most attempt to explain something they don’t
understand.

A series of almost surrealistic skits involving problems with family
life, parent-child and husband-wife relationships, create a nonsensical
impression with no concrete relief as the first half ended leaving
“White” in a pile of rubble and the audience wondering what was
happening.

In the second half, social ills are questioned and “White” is asked,
“Do you love?” He can’t answer and is advised to give up pride
and make Mother Nature his bride.

He escapes from the belly into “What Comes After” and makes
the statement that birth is violent, death is violent and life is what
is inbetween. With this “White” dies.

Southern Seminary is not Broadway but the play performance
Tuesday would do justice to the tradition of those bright lights.

Cook calls “The Belly and What Comes After” an art-theatre-
music-drama and belives attending the theatre is “an act of com-
munion-communication, a union of neighbors and strangers.”

That defines the nature of his play but—what does the play mean?

I still don’t know and one would have to see it to understand
what I mean.

How does one explain a rainbow?

Enough said. Mr. White, this
letter was not written to call you
that part of the rectal area to
which you referred. It was writ-
ten as a voice of support for the
editor and staff of the Phi, and
more important to me, to raise
some objections to your caustic
letter. My thanks go to both

enough to get me off my duff
and make me write. I hope you
will accept the editor’s invitation

On the new library

Sir:

A couple of months ago, while
the scale model of the new library
was on display, I happened to be
passing by and heard the head
librarian answering questions
about the proposed structure, I

from the front campus, as it is
only two stories, and because of
its size it will certainly provide
ample space for our expanding
book collection.

I stated at the time that I
really liked the plans, and then
asked “Why don’t they make a
walk-on roof—like the library
roofs of Tufts University and
George Washington University?”
If the proposed roof is to be flat,
and visible from the surrounding
buildings, why not make it at-
tractive and accessible? The other
students around the model seem-
ed to think it was a good idea.
In fact, everyone I’ve mentioned
it to thought the idea had merit.
Everyone except the person who
was answering the questions, that
is. He said something to the effect
that those rooves never work cor-
rectly, and besides, the students
would not use it enough to be
practical. He then said he had
to go upstairs to work,

I've been doing a lot of think-
ing since then, and I’ve decided
that [ do not understand his
answer, With today’s technology,
can’t they make a fairly inex-
pensive walk-on roof that would

all feel that the library roof is
one of the nicest places on
campus. Don’t you think that
with the view one would get of
House Mountain, the students
would use and appreciate the extra
area? I've come to the conclusion
that not putting a walk-on roof
on the new proposed library is as
absurd as required P.E:!

The Drunkard

By JESS REEVES

Evervone is busy at this time
of the year, rushing to get in
term papers at the last possible
minute and pouring over unfa-
miliar texts books in an effort to
prepare for exams. However, the
University Theatre can offer a
pleasant way to take your mind
off all these anxieties and that is
“The Drunkard.” The play will
run until Saturday with perform-
ances at 8:00. Reservations can
be made by calling the theatre
at 463-9111, ext. 273.

The play is a moral, domestic
drama in five acts adapted for
the stage by William H. Smith.
It was first performed in 1844
under Mr. Smith’s direction. The
fact that the play was first per-
formed in the mid-nineteenth cen-
tury should be kept in mind
while viewing “The Drunkard.”

When first produced “The
Drunkard” was taken, for the
most part, very seriously. The
story of the evils of alcoho] and
the near destruction of a home
was enough to make audiences of
the day weep their eyes out.

The current production of the
play is, on the other hand, more
than enough to make you smile.
The melodramatic situations
which made former audiences
grieve serve now as laughable
and comic diversion. Student di-
rector John Steves has even been
good enough to provide bags of
popcorn, a penny each, for the
audience to throw at the villain.

The plot of “The Drunkard” is
a very simple one with a nice little
moral. Edward Middleton (Hugh
Sisson) marries the sweet, charm-
ing Mary Wilson (Susan Darker)
and thus saves she and her

Tuesday’s performance still had
a few rough edges to be smoothed
down in time, but the play was
successful in its over-all attempt

must assume the proper atitude

you are in Shakey’s or a typical
family pizza parlor watching
silent flicks accompanied by piano
or organ.

tremely amusing. Barrow is blond-
haired and blue-eyed, very much
the picture of the All-American
boy. His simple, folksy humor
will make you smile if nothing
else. DeChristopher’s representa-
tion of the good Samaritan is one
of the funniest things in the
show. At times you wonder if
he and God have a hotline as he
can not seem to lower his eyes
from heaven.

“The Drunkard” will take your
mind off exams and that is
really something we all can use.
Instead of throwing a brick at
your teacher in frustration, go
to see the current produciton at
the University Theatre and throw
popeorn at the villain. It is a lot
safer and you will not be sorry.

WEL senior running for council post

By STEVE YEVICH
In talking about his running

a seat on the Lexington city

uncil, one of the first things
John Paul Woodley, Jr. a W&L
enior, stresses is that he is run-

ing not as a student candidate,
but rather as a concerned citizen
and resident of Lexington. “I
have nothing to protest, no spec-
ial interest groups, but I have
observed the situation here, hav-
ing lived here for some time.”

A legal resident of Lexington
for nearly three years, and plan-
ning to stay a few more (he has

One of five people contending

ection, Woodley is running

“strictly a positive campaign” at
] point. He feels that he is
not running against any particular
candidate, and he therefore puts
emphasis on the positive actions
that he would promote if elected.

His campaign technique is to
meet the people and take one
vote at a time, going from per-
son to person and door to door.
“People are responsive if vou are
responsible and familiar with the
issues and offer some solutions.”

WEL track team loses

Washington and Lee University
runners romped to eight out of
a possible ten firsts against Frost-
burg College in a meet held this
past Saturday afternoon at Wil-
son Field. Nevertheless, Frost-
burg emerged with the victory,
82-63.

Sophomore Tim Washington
steamed to a new school record
in the threemile run as he
nipped Stu Nibley’s previous mark
of 15:07 with a time of 15:06.3.

Freshman Paul Thomson also
ran unchallenged in the mile run
with a time of 4:26, only two sec-
onds off the school mark. In addi-
tion, Dave Estes ran his best
time this year as he captured
third place in the 880-yard run
behind a strong field of Frost-
burg foes.

However, the highlight of the
afternoon for the Generals was
the performance of the W&L
sprinters. Larry Banks, John

ucker, John Newman, and Phifer
Helms literally dusted the _ be-
wildered Frostburg challengers
off the track as they initiated the
meet’s track events by winning
the 440-vard relay with a time of
43.89 seconds.

Helms also captured a first in

y

 

the 440-yard run and in the 220-
vard competition with times of
50.1 and 23.09 seconds, respective-
lv. Dave Lawson finished third
in the 440, and aided Helms,
Tucker and Newman in winning
the mile relay with a time of
3:29.1.

John Newman took a first in
the 100-yard dash, a second in
the 220. To round out the sterl-
ing display of track prowess, Jeff
Grimm and Dave Slater finished
first and third in the 440-yard
hurdles.

In sobering contrast, W&L far-
ed poorly in the field events.
Generals fortunes were hurt
when Barclay Armstrong pulled
a ham-string while long-jumping.
Tony Perry managed to secure
the only W&L first in the field
competition when he leaped 6’0”
in the high jump. Then too, Steve
Schweizerhof turned in his best
performance of the young season
as he captured a second by toss-*
ing the shot 41’6”.

The defeat was the team‘s sec-
ond, having suffered an earlier
loss to Madison College. The
squad took on Shepherd College
Tuesday, but the result of the
confrontation was unavailable at
press time.

Baseball team 4-0.
wins in 19 innings

By BILL AUSTIN
and JACK HERRON
Scores:
Wé&L 4, Apprentice 0
W&L 6, Apprentice 3
(19 innings)

W&L’s baseball bunch made
the season’s first road trip a time
of drama and success, extending
its over-all won-lost mark to 4-0.
The victim of the latest con-
coction of fine pitching and time-
ly defense was Apprentice Col-
lege, by scores of 4-0 and 6-3.

In forging the twin triumphs,
General hitters failed to muster
an extra-base hit, but needed none
in the first contest. Rod Fer-
randino allowed but one hit in
posting his second consecutive
shutout of the fledgling campaign,
and was backed by a seven-single
attack. In addition, Apprentice’s
starting hurler and loser, John-
son, yielded six walks in his five-
inning stint.

Such wildness led directly to
Apprentice’s demise in W&L’s
half of the fourth. With one out,
Dave Otey singled and John Rice
walked, both advancing on Chip
Costello’s ground-out.

Ray Rheault drew another pass
to load the bases. His control
completely gone, Johnson issued
two more walks to Lancaster and
Higgins. Two runs were thus
forced in. Then Ben Bonaventura
grounded to the beseiged mounds-
man, whose throw to first base
was wide. Rheault scored on the
miscue, and the Generals were on
top, 3-0.

W&L added another run off an
Apprentice reliever in the sixth,
when a_ two-out Bonaventura
single scored Tom Lancaster.

If the first game was a smooth-
ly conducted exhibition of pitch-
ing excellence, the second one
was a wild, even zany affair. It
lasted nineteen innings, witnessed
the ejection of a General player
and a General head coach and
featured a game-saving play.

Dan Westbrook started and
pitched 12 innings, allowing two
runs. Yet he was tagged sharply
for 11 hits, experiencing consid-
erable difficulty with his curves.
Nevertheless, W&L seemed head-
ed for an easy win in the early
going, taking a 2-0 lead into the
bottom of the sixth. At that time,
Wecstbrook gave up two runs,
the second one a disputed play
at the plate.

Umpiring decisions continued
to attract attention, particularly
in the bottom of the eleventh
when, with two down and a run-
ner on first, Westbrook fielded
a grounder and threw a bit wide
to John Rice for an apparent
third out. At least the first base
ump deemed it so, and W&L
players trotted to the dugout.
However, the Apprentice squad
appealed to the seer behind the
plate, who declared that the first-
sacker’s foot had come off the bag
in taking the throw. Accordingly,

the eleventh inning was still in
progress.

Coach Lyles charged the
vacillating officials, and launch.
ed into a heated protest, only to
be answered by an umpire’s
thumb, When Dave Otey led
off the twelfth, his questioning
of a so-called strike drew a
similar response.

In the thirteenth, Westbrook
gave way to freshman’ Bob
Carpentier, who somehow parlay-
ed a sinker that would not stay
low in the retiring of 14 consecu-
tive Apprentice batters. However,
his performance seemed to be in
vain when Apprentice had a run-
ner on third with one out in the
eighteenth. A fairly deep fly ball
to centerfield appeared a sure
sacrifice, but Henry Semple made
the catch and fired a one-hop
strike homeward, nabbing the
enemy baserunner to complete an
amazing double-play. The W&L
bench spilled onto the field in
disbelief.

Apparently inspired, long-silent
General bats, having whiffed 17
times in the game, connected for
six consecutive singles in the top
of the nineteenth. Hathway, Rice,
Burton, Rheault, Larkin and
Semple all rapped basehits and
four runs scored. Semple’s blow
proved to be the difference, as
it drove in two team-mates. Not:
ably, Paul Larkins single was of
the 330-foot variety, a bases-load.-
ed line drive which carommed off
the outfield fence.

Carpentier picked up the win,
while Apprentice’s Allen, one
who made two separate appear-
ances on the mound in the course
of the extra-inning struggle.

W&L was to have met Old
Dominion University in a Mon.
day afternoon double-header, but
returned to Lexington when a
seven-inch snowfall blanketed the
Tidewater area. Nonetheless, the
streak will again be put to the
test this afternoon, in a 3 p.m.
home game with Hampden-Syd-
nev College.

JV lacrosse

Behind the goaltending of resh.-
man Bob Auerbach, Washington

team posted an 8-4 victory over
the Charlottesville Lacrosse Club

The Little Generals, coached by
senior Tom Young, put the game
away with five second-half goals.

Auerbach, who Jack Emmer
said was “just a hair away from
being on the varsity,” was given

Rob Daniels led the scoring

Stickmen dump Middies

you want to use the term loosely)

Midshipmen’s home Astroturf.

For

Middies in the NCAA quaterfinals.

The win came as a surprise
to many observers, who wonder-
ed if the Generals could stay with
their well-conditioned opponents.
As it turned out, they did more
than that.

“We got stronger as the game
went along,” said W&L head
coach Jack Emmer. “im fact, I
thought we had more left in us
towards the end of the game
than Navy did.

“There’s no doubt in my mind
that our hard practices and con-
ditioning paid dividends for us
last week.”

Warfield was only one of many
W&L players who, according to

Emmer, played exceptionally
well.
Midfielder Ted Bauer backed

Wafield up with four goals, all
coming on the patented “Bauer
crank.” Two of Bauer’s tallies
were with the Middies a man
short due to penalties.

Bryan Chasney, who played
nearly the entire game at both
attack and midfield, chipped in
two goals and two assists. Skip
Lichtfuss and Don Carroll each
scored once to round out the scor-
ing.

But offense was only half of
the story.

“Once again, we got a tremend-
ous team job on defense,” Emmer
said. “Our close defense was
superb. We were espceially proud
of Rob Lindsey, who shut off
(Dave) Bakly from the ball al-
most all afternoon.

“Tom Keigler did a great job
of holding down (Bruce) Long, a
freshman who had scored five
goals against UMBC in Navy’s
previous outing.

“And Jimmy Farrar did on un-
noticeably good job covering who-
ever Navy would put on the
crease.

Emmer said that goalie Skeet
Chadwick started lowly, but
then rallied himself and the de-

fense and ended up with a fine
performance.

“People have said that the Navy
goalie (Ray Finnegan) may have
some sort of edge over Skeet,”
Emmer said. “But for two straight
vears Skeet has outplayed his
Navy counterpart.”

Chadwick ended up the game
with 19 saves.

But there was one more hero,
who did his work out of position.

“We used Dave Eubank, who
is normally a defenseman, as a
wingman on_ faceoffs,’ Emmer
said. “Navy is usually a good
faceoff team, so we put ‘Weeb’
in there to cause a little extra
commotion on the faceoff so that
our chances of getting the loose
ball would be better.”

Evidently the strategy worked.
With Eubank on the wing, W&L
controlled 16 of 28 faceoffs. The
first five times Eubank was in
the Generals came up with the
ball.

The game didn’t really swing
in the Generals’ direction until
the third quarter. A 4-4 tie re-
sulted after the first period, with
Bauer getting both of his extra
man goals in the opening stanza.

WEL pulled ahead 7-6 at half:
time, as Warfield notched his sec-
ond and third goals of the con-
test within 18 seconds of each
other. Carroll’s goal late in the
period gave the Generals the half:
time advantage.

Navy rallied early in the third,
scoring three times while only
Warfield could tally for W&lL.
With nine minutes left in the
quarter, W&L trailed 9-8.

Then it all changed. The W&L
defense shut off Navy for the
next 21 minutes, while the offense
went to work,

Goals by Lichtfuss, Bauer, and
Chasney in the third gave W&L
an 11-9 lead going to the final
fifteen minutes. Bauer then got
his fourth, and Warfield followed
with his fifth and final goal to
make it 13-9. Navy scored late in
the game to make it a 13-10 ball
game.

The Generals play host to Deni-
son University Friday at 3 p.m.
on Wilson Field. The Big Red

champions six of the last seven
