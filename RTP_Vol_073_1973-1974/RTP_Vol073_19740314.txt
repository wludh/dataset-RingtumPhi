By ROBERT PUGH

Bob Keatley and Chris Scully
are competing in a run-off today
for student body vice-president.

Ben Bailey was elected presi-
dent and Mike Luttig secretary
Monday. Both are presently on
the EC.

The vote totals were: president:
Ben Bailey—429, Mark Mennel—
96; vice-president: Bob Keatley—
314, Chris Scully—247, Beb Sher-
man — 159; secretary: Mike
Luttig—457.

Class officers will be elected
Monday, March 25. President,
vice-president, and EC repre-
sentatives for each class will be
chosen. Three vice-presidents
will be elected from the senior
class, one each for arts, sciences,
and commerce. Any candidate
wishing his name on the ballot
should turn in a petition with
50 signatures to the EC Box
by 6 p.m. Monday, March 18.
Prospective candidates should
be at that night’s EC meeting.

The EC last Monday night dis-
cussed hiring a local law firm to
study the student body’s need for
legal services in three areas: 1)
to represent student government,
2) to advise individual students,

 

Sadie DuVergne Robert
Gaines, widow of Dr. Francis
Pendleton Gaines, president of
Washington and Lee Univer-
sity from 1930 to 1959, died
unexpectedly Monday in Stone-
wall Jackson Hospital here.

Funeral services were held
at 11 a.m. Wednesday in Lee
Chapel. Dr. David Sprunt pre-
sided over the service. Re-
memberance and gifts may be
made to the Francis P. Gaines
Scholarship Fund.

When Mrs. Gaines arrived in
Lexington in 1930, she was de-
scribed as “pleasant, gracious,
wholesome—just the kind of
president’s wife the students,
teachers, and people of Lexing-
ton want.”

When Dr. Gaines retired
from the presidency in 1959,
he and Mrs. Gaines built a
townhouse on Estill Street in
Lexington, and divided their
time between it and their
Rockbridge farm, ‘“Penrobin.”
After her husband’s death Dec.
31, 1963, Mrs. Gaines remained
in the city.

She maintained a deep in-
terest in Washington and Lee
up to her death, and continued
to entertain her friends—new
ones, some nearly a half-cen-
tury younger than she, as well
as old.

The Executive Committee of

Classes scheduled for that Mon-

held Friday afternoon, April 19.
Monday morning classes (A-F)
will be held Saturday morning.

The date of return from the
spring break was changed last

Disciplining the students

The case of the four students disciplined for the painting of the
statue of George Washington atop Washington Hall (see story else-
where in this paper) brings to the forefront the issue of student
discipline at Washington and Lee.

The four were told by the Student Control Committee to pay for
the cost of repainting the statue white, a penalty which follows
tradition as does the painting of the statue itself.

The penalty was accepted by the students after it was learned
they would be billed for only one coat of paint at a cost of more
than $110.

Such acceptance of a SCC decision is rather anomalous in the
scheme of student discipline at Washington and Lee. Indeed, the four
students were ready to appeal the decision to the Student Affairs
Committee, the board of appeals for SCC decisions, after estimates
for repainting the statue were first given at $250. SCC told the four
to pay the fine fully expecting the university to charge the full $250.

So if the four had appealed, they would have been following
the normal course of action at W&L. The SCC decides on a punish-
ment; the punishment is usually seen by those convicted as too
harsh; those who are punished appeal to the Student Affairs Com-
mittee; SAC lightens the penalty, leaving everybody happy, save
for SCC members.

What is anomalous here is that SCC is made up entirely of stu-
dents, while SAC is half student and half faculty. It is the student
disciplinary body which time after time levels what many (includ-
ing SAC) see as unreasonable penalty.

 

And the members of SCC are elected by the student body. The
members are presidents and vice-presidents of all undergraduate
classes and of the Student Bar Association of the law school.

Meanwhile, a faculty ad hoc committee has come out with a
report recommending the abolition of SAC. That committee would
be replaced by a Review Board, according to the committee proposal,
of the Dean of Students as non-voting chairman, two faculty mem-
bers of the University Council, and three student members of the UC.

While we applaud the ad hoc committee for asking for a student
majority on the Review Board, we must be a bit apprehensive. For
it has been SCC, composed mainly of students, which has been
administering penalties which SAC, half students and half faculty
and administration, has had the wisdom to reduce.

We sincerely hope the University Council, the executive committee
of the faculty, and the faculty itself all take a long, hard look at
the ad hoe committee report before taking action on it. For while
we favor a better opportunity for student input to be injected into
the “system” at W&L, we favor more highly the fair discipline of
students, be it administered by students or faculty or both.

Contact °74

From Heywood Hale Brown's first multi-syllabic word two-and-
a-half weeks ago in Lee Chapel, to director William Friedkin’s
promise last Thursday to send a batch of “The Exorcist” T-shirts to
W&L, Contact ’74 celebrated the symposium’s tenth year of existence
in grand fashion.

Co-chairman Chris Harris and Harrison Turnbull and their com-
mittee provided a popular, though only rudimentarily thematic,
symposium. The “Contemporary Communications” theme magically
appeared as the original theme of “Arts in the Twentieth Century”
slowly disintegrated because the committee chairmen only wanted
“big name” personalities, and nobody from the fine arts seemed
to qualify.

No matter what the theme, however, an estimated 2,300 persons
attended the four Contact presentations, and that figure would have
been higher had the State Theatre been able to set more than 650
persons. The program was, simply, a success,

On the ‘Big’ three elections

To call this year’s “Big Three” elections boring is like calling
Lexington a thriving metropolis.

The only election of note was that for the office of Executive
Committee vice-president, where junior Bob Keatley and Chris Scully
outpolled junior Ben Sherman to make today’s run-off. Otherwise,
what can be said when candidates for two of the “Big Three”
offices, as they are almost facetiously called, run unopposed?

Nonetheless, Ben Bailey and Mike Luttig were elected for presi-
dent and secretary of the student body, respectively, and both would
have had a good chance of winning even with opposition,

But as last year’s fiery contest has to this point produced little
action (and not because president Doug Schwartz hasn't at least been
trying to get some changes made), we hope this year’s less-than-fiery
election will produce some much needed action next year.

Ask Traveller

Q—What are vour feelings on the arts and crafts in Lexington?

A—You'll have to talk louder, I’ve got a boy scout in my ear. No,
seriously, I’m convinced that the less said about the matter the
better. Frankly, this business of growing and sewing one’s own
food and clothes sounds positively revolting. The three-day old
bananas at Krogers are bad enough without having to wear
them too. Why, I knew a man once who left the city and went
into the woods to build his own house. It took him five years
and the first day he moved in, the roof collapsed and killed
him while he was eating peanut brittle and reading California on
50¢ a Day by the Donner Party. Luckily, he had Mutual of Omaha
Cave-in and Mudslide coverage and today his widow lives com-
fortably in a swanky Manhatten townhouse. Now, the moral of
this tragedy is not simply to pitch a tent on campout, (and remem-
ber, the latrine goes outside the campsite, not directly in front
of the tent flap), but rather to think safety first when “doing
it yourself.”

Life is not a hobby that can be played around with and then
thrown away like a can of Bon Vivant vichyssoise, though there
may be some correlation between adolescence and food poisoning.
Life is a full-time affair, governed by inalienable ambitions such
as getting snorkled on sterno and vandalizing cemeteries during
rush hour.

A point of contention in this artsy/craftsy debate has been:
should an institute of higher learning, like W&L, offer credit
courses in the manual skills. How silly. Should a goose lay a
duck egg? Does the coyote have the vote in North Dakota? Can
a man with no shoulders wear suspenders? The answer, of
course, is no, the reason being that repairing a foreign car has
not been traditionally considered a part of higher learning since
Napoleon stripped his gears at Waterloo.
Such pursuits as woodworking and logrolling are nice if one
has the inclinations and can get a merit badge or two for doing
them. By the way, the Bauhaus movement in Germany, referred
to in a letter last week by an irate handyman, was nothing more
than Durwood Kirby’s campaign to provide every Bavarian house-
wife with a vego-matic and cap snaffler before the war. What
it has to do with arts and crafts I don’t now. Let’s just drop the
whole topic before the great ice age reappears and we're all
selling matches on the street corner.

Q—Any closing statement?

A—I tell you, I didn’t even know North Dakota was ours,

Inside-Out

By ROME SCOTT

LEXINGTON—William Friedkin didn’t even have horns when he
appeared at the State Theater Thursday night.

The director of the “Exorcist” put on a performance more than
suitable for the end of Washington and Lee University’s 1974 Contact
program. The theater-packing audience was alternately amused and
amazed by the man’s wit and insight as he talked about his theories
of making movies citing specific incidents in folming “The French
Connection,” “Boys in the Band” and the “Exorcist.”

“I’m a film director and I know that’s a great mystery,” Friedkin
said. “I tell a story.”

He said that his business is communicating, first with the people
involved in making a movie, and then, through them, with the
audience.

“There was a time when I felt that film was primarily a _ per-
sonal medium,” he said. “Now, I feel privileged to entertain an
audience.”

Friedkin said a film has to make them cry, laugh or scare or
it does not serve its purpose.

He started his career as a mailroom clerk at a Chicago television
station who became interested in program direction and “learned
by rote” after working hours watching the ways of the studio.

Within a year of beginning his job, Friedkin became a director
of live television shows.

After his television stint, he left Chicago to do film documentaries
until, in 1967, he directed his first full-length feature film.

Since then, he has directed such notables as “The Night They
Raided Minsky’s,” “The Birthday Party,” “The Boys in the Band,”
“The French Connection,” for which he won an Academy Award as
best director, and the “Exorcist.”

Friedkin said he believes there are two major influences on his
movie-making style: the devices used in making Orson Welles’
“Citizen Kane” and the theories behind Cubism.

“‘Citizen Kane’ is a quarry for film-makers,” he said. He added
that he has gone over the movie many times in minute detail to
learn as much from it as he could.

The influence of the style of the cubistic painters suggests depth,
a greater depth than two dimensions, he said. Using the principles
of cubism, Friedkin said he was able to give an illusion of depth in
a flat medium to such film sequences as the chase scene in “The
French Connection.”

He showed portions of the chase scene to point out how cubistic
montage, a combination of shots cut directly into each other, with
sound, creates the effect of the sequence.

“Editing is the language of film-making,” Frisdkin said. It was
the cutting of simple shots together that created the chase scene
which he meant to embody the character of Popeye Doyle, he said.

The idea for making the “Exorcist” came after he read the book

Oregon-Synthesizing a

by William Peter Blatty but he did not realize the book was based
on an actual case of demonic possession until he researched the
subject for the film.

Friedkin said, “Al demonic cases involve the same symptom of
possession.” He said that, if the case on which the movie is based
was not a case of demonic possession, then “it’s an inexplicable
disease for which there is no name.”

“It had to be a real film of inexplicable things,” he said about
his intention for making the movie.

The director showed a film clip made while trying the various
effects of tearing skin, a rocking room, lettering on a chest and
others seen in the final version of the movie.

The movie has been said to be obscene but this is not true,
Fiedkin said. The movie rating system “only regards sex, not violence
because violence, as we know, is taken for granted in this country,”
he said.

The reports that the movie has detrimental effects on some
wievers, he said, are not true. “If it’s possible for the news media
to blow this out of proportion, they will.”

Back to music for music’s sake. A crowd at the Roanoke Civic
Center found that Chicago means more than a windy city in Illinois.
When the name pertains to an eight-man band, it means goodtime
music.

Despite equipment problems during the performance Friday
night, Chicago put on a personality-packed, professional and precise
showcase of the style that makes the group’s music something special.

The usual lead guitar, bass, keyboards and drums that make up
most groups are augmented by a horn section in Chicago, a horn
section so coordinated it sounds like one smooth, well-blended instru-
ment.

Those horns intermingle with the more basic backyard of the
other instruments to form a type of music that is disticntly Chicago.

Add that to the sensitivity of the vocals rolling out meaningful
lyrics and one has the kind of music that has fingers snapped to
it, hands clopped to it and is hummed all day long.

The group covered its musical history playing recent hits such
as “Saturday in the Park” and “Feeling Stronger Everyday” as
well as “I’m a Man” which is on its first album.

The songs ranged in genre from rock to reggae to ragtime and
rock and roll, exemplifying the versatility of music which is well:
planned but not contrived.

The sound was put together with vice-tightness and trucked out
by musicians who looked as if they enjoyed every minute of the
performance.

And even with the tightness of the sound, the music conveyed
a lightness, the breezy feeling of Chicago.
Madura also appeared Friday night.

musical heritage

By RICHARD JOHNSON

Five groups were nominated for
the jazz group Grammy this year.
Three represent jazz of the past:
Jim Hall and Ron Carter from
the sixties, Cannonball Adderley
unchanged from the fifties, and
Supersax doing Charlie Parker
solos from the late forties.

The future lies with the other
two. Chick Corea and Return to
Forever arrived just in time to
take the lead in electronic jazz-
rock from the defunct Mahavishnu
Orchestra and Weather Report,
giving it a Latin twist of their
own, They have strong competi-
tion from Herbie Hancock, and
probably from Larry Coryell’s
new group, The Eleventh House,
as well as from the former mem-
bers of Mahavishnu and Weather
Report.

With a little help from Eng-
land, where Soft Machine is an
exception among bands who excel
at songwriting and improvise
only occasionally, the new blend
of jazz and rock with synthesiz-
ers may become the dominant
musical expression of our time.

And what of Oregon, the fifth

nominee? First, the music they
make isn’t often jazz. If it has
affinities with any of the people
above it is with Josef Zawinul
of Weather Report and John Mc-
Laughlin of the Mahavishnu
Orchestra, whose formal com-
positions are akin in harmonic
style to those of Oregon’s chief
composer and guitarist, Ralph
Towner.

What they share is mostly pro-
gressive by thirds, rather than
the fourths, fifths, and seconds
of most tonal music. But the dif-
ference in instrumental medium
is extreme. Oregon uses no elec-
tronics, and no electric instru-
ments except a few bars of elec-
tric bass in one song.

Improvised music is always in-
fluenced by the capabilities of the
instruments; it is as much in the
players’ fingers as in their heads,
and music made with piano,
guitar, bass, oboe, tablas, and
congas is so different from that
made with electric pianos, electric
guitars, electric violins, synthe-
sizers, saxophones, and drums
that their overall structural simi-
larity is lost.

A crucial element of jazz is
also missing from Oregon’s music:
funk. Blues notes and the kind
of rhythmic irony generated by
the Black American experience
take fourth place to European
classical music, Arabic and Indian
music, and South American rhy-
thms among the constituents of
their style, or lack of it.

So Oregon is unique, as those
fortunate enough to be in Lee
Chapel last Wednesday know al-
ready. Four men, on their 15 or
20 instruments, make music
which synthesizes most of the
world’s musical heritage into a
pleasant pastoral evening. Music,
when not tied to words, has al-
ways been improvisational out-
side the West; notation and regu-
larization only became necessary
with the advent of polyphony, a
purely Western conception.

Most troubadour songs and half
of Machaut’s output as late as
the 14th century are written with
only one line, the accompaniment
to be supplied by the players.
Oregon’s materials for improvisa-
tion usually consist of harmonic
sequences as well as melodies as-

sociated with them.

The free improvisations (they
did two here) are another matter.
While the structured pieces take
about as generous a view of to-
nality and the possibilities of
sonority as Debussy, the free
pieces explore harmonic and tex:
tural styles as diverse as Ives,
Weill, Webern, and the late Stra-
vinsky. It is to Debussy and
Stravinsky that they are princip.
ally indebted, for the techniques
of continuity by ostinato and tonal
conflict among parts.

Oregon’s visit may have been
the most important musical
event here since the visit of the
Group for Contemporary Music in
1971, and this leads to the ques-
tion of the American avant-garde
Carter, Babbitt, Berger, Wuorinen,
Stewart et al have created a
music whose complexity and
drama of rhythm, harmony, and
texture seems forever beyond the
reach of improvisation. Whether
the best young musicians will
ever integrate the two will be the
major musical question for the
rest of the century,

Transactional Anal

This is the last in a series of
articles exploring various per-
sonal services in the area avail-
able to Washington and Lee
students,

By DARRYL CARLTON
One final resource in the com-
munity are groups that meet to
develop interpersonal skills.
Three people involved in this
area of human relationship are

the Rev. Michael Dwinell, as-
sistant rector of —R. 6. hee
Episcopal Church, Cammie

Dwinell, his wife, and Ken Lane,
as assistant dean of W&L and
the head of University Services.
Rev. Dwinell says he is avail-
able for one-to-one counseling. He
also conducts 12-hour marathon
human relations experiences
when there is enough interest,
and lead groups in the theory
and practice of Transactional
Analysis at R. E. Lee Church.
Finally, he is a regional coordina-
tor in MATC, the Mid-Atlantic
Training Committee, which car-
ries out local and regional pro-
grams in human relation skills.
Transactional Analysis is taught
at the Episcopal Church by
Michael and Cammie Dwinell in
an eight week program, for one
night a week. Briefly, TA is a
relatively new psychology based
on individual responsibility and
awareness. Michael and Cammie
teach the program in two parts.
First, there is an eight-week
program to learn the language of
Transactional Analysis, which
the individual can then apply to
his own life. There is also a more
advanced program for those who
want to use TA learnings for
interpersonal growth in a group
setting. According to Rev. Dwinell,
“all kinds of people join this,
often from the W&L community.”
The present introductory group

has three W&L students in it, as
Well as students from Southern
Seminary. “The introductory
course was so popular this time
we had to split it into two di-
visions,” he commented.

Rev. Dwinell divided the groups
available to the W&L community
into three levels. The first level
is the weekly groups, such as
a TA group. The second level is
a weekend, often at Phoebe
Needles, a conference center of
the Episcopal Diocese, which is
composed of people mainly from
the area of Southwest Virginia.

The third level is the more
extensive program, Human Re-
lation Labs, sponsored by MATC
on a more widespread basis. Ac-
cording to Rev. Dwinell, the ex-
periential model of education is
used here. He defined this as
“Learning by doing and then re-
flecting on it.” He compared this
type of learning to that used by
a football coach who takes movies
of the team and shows them
What they did, and how they
could improve. These ideas are
then incorporated into the next
“practice.”

Experiential learning also in-
volves only the present, the “here-
and-now,” and in the groups the
past lives of individuals are not
a subject for discussion or inter-
action. In such groups relational
skills are learned, or as Rev.
Dwinell put it, “the question of
‘who am I, who are you, and who
are we together’.”

Rev. Dwinell emphasized that
such groups are not for the emo-
tinaily disturbed. To insure that
such people do not join such
groups, a person must fill out a
short but intensive application in
which questions are asked about
prior emotional difficulties, and
to which a statement must be

attached from a human relations
trainer stating what in his/her
opinion such a person wants from
the human relations event. The
Rev. Dwinell called this applica-
tion, “one of the best I’ve ever
seen.”

Rev. Dwinell admitted that such
groups were artificial, in that be-
havior in them does not neces-
sarily correspond to that in the
real world. He stated that this
was, in fact, a good thing, and
commented “we don’t want to
turn people into lab freaks, but
to take what they have learned
about themselves back home and
perhaps make some new decision
based on the information gained
there.” Some other things they
may gain can be increased ability
to listen and to respond to other
people, increased esteem for them-
selves and others, and new ways
to handle old feelings. “This type
of training is not therapy, but it
may be therapeutic,” he com-
mented.

Cost of such programs may
vary from two dollars a session
for a TA group to 35 dollars for
a weekend at Phoebe Needles,
Which includes room and board
and staff expenses.

Rev. Dwinell also is available
as a consultant to groups which
he himself does not lead. He is
knowledgeable in decision mak-
ing skills and in the skills of
goal setting. In conclusion, he
commented, “These programs are
not for sick people who want
to get well, but for healthy people
who want to get better.”

Another community resource is
Ken Lane, director of University
Center. He is available for stu-

ysis offered

dent-originated group personal
growth worshops, he said. He is
also conducting a communications
workshop with Jim Worth, uni-
versity psychologist. In this group
everyone decides their own inter-
personal goals, then works to-
ward them as a group.

Ken plans to lead a class in
the spring, Religion 381, which
incorporates his ideas about what
liberal education should be. “It
see the class as an experiment,”
he commented. It will be an aca-
demic course, but will differ from
other courses in that it will
“Challenge the students to relate
to the material personally” and
to “assume responsibility for their
own learning.”

Ken sees the purpose of a lib-
eral art education as teaching
flexibility, creativity, and social!
and person responsibility.” He
stated that he would like to see
more of this at W&L, and feels
that most students and teachers
are over-involved in academic
rather than in personal growth.
“The ability to think and to
synthesize is more important
than knowledge of any single sub-
ject” he continued. Using this as
a basis for a theory of learning,
he sees the Rev. Michael Dwinell,
Jim Worth, the unversity psy-
chologist, and Terry Wingfield,
the university psychiatrist, as re-
sources for the education of the
“whole man.”

A new fine arts center,
What exactly do we need?

, JESS REEVES

It te Seca apparent to many
members of the campus commun-
ity that a new fine arts center
is needed, the sooner the better.
Doug Schwartz attempted to im-
press this fact upon the Board
of Trustees at their recent meet-
ing in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. It is
easy enough to say that a fine
arts facility is needed, but what
exactly should such a building in-
clude?

According to the director of the
drama program at Washington
and Lee, Professor Lee Kahn,
“We need a theatre!” What he
refers to is a facility which will
satisfy the demands of a grow-
ing department. The requirements
for continuing a quality fine arts
program must be understood in
terms of the goals of the depart-
ment in question. These are de-
scribed in the self study of the
music and drama departments
completed one year ago.

The drama program at Wash-
ington and Lee serves two pur-
poses. First, it has a general re-
sponsibility to the community to
serve in an educational capacity.
This is accomplished by offering
various productions in which stu-
dents and faculty may participate
actively or as members of the
eudience.

This function is at present be-
ing served by the university
theatre but only within severe
limitations, The facilities definite-
ly limit the choice and method of
production.

The second purpose of a theatre
facility here is the training of
those who are interested in
theatre as a career or course of
study. In most respects the pres-
ent facility falls far short of what
is needed.

To continue to improve the pro-

gram a larger and more flexible
stage required, one which
would allow both actor and di-
rector greater freedom. For ex-
ample, more wing space, a much

higher proscenium arch, and ac-
cess from one side of the stage to

Storage & Free Moth Proofing

the other without having to go
behind scenery are all necessary.

The auditorium for such a fa-
cility need not be large and a
capacity of 250 should prove ade-
quate. What is important to the
department is flexibility for both
the stage and the auditorium.
Seating arrangement and floor
levels should be adjustable.

Other important facilities are
desirable as well. Such a center
should have a sound proof scene
shop, adequate space for prop and
costume storage, a costume shop
equipped to make costumes, and
lighting and_ sound facilities
which are necessary to a com-
plete theatre.

Additional classroom space is
desirable to meet the increasing
demand of students who are in-
terested in drama. Currently,
History of Theatre is taught in
the lobby. This arrangement

creates crowding and discomfort
to both the teacher and the class.

Acting classes are also taught
in the lobby of the university
theatre. Rehearsal studios should
be available for this purpose and
not make-shift areas. A laboratory
theatre should be included to give
a permanent home base for small
and student directed productions.

Classrooms are special facilities
are nonexistant at this point. The
faculty of the drama department
feels that the present structure is
being utilized to the very fullest
extent. A new fine arts facility
is needed so the program can
continue to grow and keep a-
breast of student demands upon

the department.

The trustees will have their
chance to see the inadequacies of
the theatre when they come to
W&L for their spring meeting.

Student artists fined

The four students responsible for painting George Washington’s
statue blue on Fancy Dress Weekend has reimbursed the schoo] for

the repainting of the statute.

They appealed the decision of the Student Control

Committee

which called for them to pay for the damage, $250 worth. A com-
promise, was found and it required the painters to pay for one coat
of paint for George. This amounted to $114.84, whereas the $250 figure
was an estimate for two coats of paint. The University will cover the
cost of the second coat of paint as a maintenance expense.

Students, faculty, administration, and alumni showed support for
the action of the four students by contributing the full $114.84.

W&L hockey fanatics
bring the game south

By BILL AUSTIN

Hockey lives, indeed flourishes
in this seeming southland strong-
hold. The sport’s existence on
campus may be news to some,
but to the 30-35 W&L students
who have, since December band-
ed together for a bith of this
winter-time exuberance, it has be-
come something special.

Actually ,the urge to don skates
and to wield a stick in pursuit
of an elusive puck is not a novel
one, For the past copule of years,
a dedicated few have sought a
time and a place to play hockey,
often settling on the less-than-
ideal facilities at the Natural
Bridge Ice Rink.

However, this past November,
W&L senior Ken Daniels under-
took a serious effort to unite
those interested in hockey into a
loosley-knit club, hopefully pro-
viding the basis for a more
extensive sort of program in fu-
ture years. Since an initial turn-
out of but 15 devotees before
Thanksgiving, the club has at-
tracted increasing support. Close
to 20 students have participated
in the weekly excurisions to Na-
tural Bridge, and on four occa-
sions have pooled their resources
to rent ice-time in the Roanoke
and Salem Civic Centers.

To be sure, finances have re-
lentlessly badgered the endeavor.
Equipment is scarce, expensive.
Jersey purchased from Pres
Brown’s cost a cool $16. Ice-
time is hotly contested because
of the general growth of valley
interests in hockey. It rental
means the expenditure of from
$25 to $30 per huor.

Yet, the club is thriving, if
enjoyment can be taken as a mea-

sure of success. “We play for
fun...Anybody can participate,
and everybody who comes to our
inter-squad scrimmages plays,”
asserted Daniels. And to date, the
affair has been bloodless. “Until
the proper equipment is ours, we
will play hockey with caution.”

Though the talents involved are
disparate, the club has been uni-
fied by its members’ common zeal
for the game. Surely, it is sport
on the most elementary, yet
satisfying level.

Still, the money problem per-
sists. The club has been approach-
ed by the Roanoke Valley Adult
Hockey Program to field a com-
petitive league squad for next
season. At present, a few W&L
students take part on a fill-in
hasis in the four-team league.
However, chances for a repre-
sentative W&L squad appear
quite dim.

“The expenses for all the equip-
ment needed in league play are
staggering.” Daniels posited, then
added, ‘‘and those Roanoke guys
are tough...”

The club’s future course seems
upward. Next year, it is hoped
that members will meet in Sep-
tember, and that a dues system
will be employed in order to make
possible regular scheduling of
scrimmages. As the graduating
Daniels put it: “This year was
just a start. A nucleus of under-
ciassmen, 20 guys, will carry it
from here, garnering more prac-
tice-time, more equipment. VMI
has started a hockey club of its
own. Who knows, maybe we'll
play them before too long.”

If enthusiasm determines any-
thing, hockey is here to stay.

March 14, 1974

win,

ranked fourth

By BILL FLESHER

Every year there are students
who come to Washington and Lee
who have never seen a lacrosse
game.

Their questions range from
“What game does lacrosse most
resemble?” to “Is a lacrosse face-
off like a hockey faceoff?” to “Do
they really hit people with those
sticks?”

This year the veteran fans will
tell the newcomers stories about
the season past—about the Vir-
ginia and Navy wins, about the
strength and speed of NCAA
champion Maryland, about some
of last year’s great individual per-
formances.

An often told tale was the story
of a shot—the cannon-like shot of
All-American Ted Bauer.

“Ever see Bob Feller’s fast
ball?,” an older fan once asked.
“Bauer’s shot is even faster.”

Another fan would give advice.
“Don’t blink when Bauer has the
ball, or else vou might miss
something.”

And so the newcomers went to
Wilson Field Saturday to see their
first lacrosse game. And to see
the “Bauer crank.”

It was only fitting that “Teddy
Bear” should score the Generals’
first goal of the 1974 season—on
a crank no less—pleasing the fans
voth old and new, and sparking
a seven goal first period barrage
that sent W&L toward a. 16-4

As did the fans, W&L head
coach Jack Emmer liked what he
saw.

“We're way ahead of where we
were at this time last year,”
Emmer said after the game. “We
were able to run our fast break
well, our passing was good for
this early in the year, and our
defense, though never seriously
challenged, looked very good.”

The college division coach-of- ;

fielders. “Once they get some
playing time together, they’ll be
very tough. It’s just a question
of how long that will take.”

Bauer, John Lalley, and fresh-
man Jay Monahan make up the
“blue” midfield. The “red” line
combines junior Ken Miller with
a pair of freshmen, Mick Kohlen-
stein and Ralph Baugher, while
Lichtfuss centers the “green” mid-
field with freshman Jack Dudley
and senior Jim Stieff.

Chasney will also run with the
green midfield, depending on the
attack strategy Emmer employs.

Bauer, Baugher, and Lichtfuss
will handle faceoff duties for their
respective midfields.

Defensively, Emmer must fill
the shoes of All-American Dan

vear. Back are co-captain Jim

Freshman Tom Keigler, who look-

opener, will hold down the num-

on defense are two more fresh-
men, Steve White and Steve Di-

Skeet Chadwick, the other co-
captain, will again be in the nets

year, it was Chadwick who gave
the fans some of last vear’s big-

saves in the Virginia and Navy

be soph Malcolm Hastings and
freshman Todd Galvin.
