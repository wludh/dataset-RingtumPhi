Few attend honor forum

Vol. LXXIII

by PAUL MORELLA

An open discussion on _ the
Honor System at Washington and
Lee University was held Tues-
day evening in Lee Chapel in an
attempt to develop an understand-
ing of the current sentiments to-
ward the system.

Chaired by current student
body president, Doug Schwartz
and next year’s student body
president, Ben Bailey, the discus-
sion, which began at 8 p.m. was
attended by about 26 students
and faculty members, but had
dwindled down to 15 when the
meeting ended at 10:35.

In light of the recent public
honor trial, a question was raised
concerning the effect of a public
trial on the honor system. “Of
course this is my personal opi-
nion,” stated Bailey, “but anyone
who says that the last public
honor trial was the end of the
honor system is barking up the
wrong tree.”

In adition, Schwartz added that
the verdict shows that the stu-
dents don’t buy a black-white, ab-
solute penalty honor system.
Along the same lines, a good part
of the earlier discussion was cen-
tered around the public trial and
the questions that arose concern.
ing the transcripts, the jury, and
other aspects.

However, as the discussion pro-
gressed, one faculty member out-
lined the necessity for defining
honor and advocated discussing
the system much more openly in
the near future. “I would fulfill
my obligations to the system,”
stated Professor Mario Pellicciaro,

“but I would like this thing talk-
ed about more openly if I am to
abide by it.” It (the honor sys-
tem) is full of problems and it
might help to talk about it.

“T asked for a definition of
honor,” continued the faculty
member, “I mean, is it honorable
to write a paper you don’t believe
in, but you know it will get you
a good grade?”

To this Schwartz replied that
the problem of defining whether
or not an act is dishonorable is a
“gut” decision and that “honor is
nebulous.” Dean John _ added,
“The idea of honor at W&L has
traditionally been an absolute
one.” He continued by saying that
previously, honor would have
been defined but now, each per-
son feels compelled to abide by
their own definition of honor.

For most of the evening the dis-
cussion covered the questions of
why have an honor system and
why limit it to “lying, cheating,
and stealing.” Although the dis-
cussion did not satisfy completely
those involved, it did, neverthe-
less, open new channels for de-
bate on the rising concern for the
Honor System at Washington and
Lee.

Correction

Last week’s Ring-tum Phi stat-
ed that the faculty defeated mo-
tions to add one student to each of
the Courses and Degrees Commit-
tee and the Faculty Executive
Committee. The faculty, however,
did approve the additional stu-
dent on the Courses and Degrees
Committee by a reportedly large
majority. The second motion fail-

ed.

And on page 8, the Phi listed
nine students as an apparent re-
view board on student discipline.
The list of students, however, rep-
resents the new student repre.
sentation on the University Coun.
cil. The Student Affairs Com-
mittee will maintain reviewing
power of discipline cases,

Increasing student voices

Last week, the faculty voted to place an adidtional student,
picked from the student body at large, on the Courses and
Degrees Committee of the university. The faculty also de-
feated a motion which would have placed a second student on
the Faculty Executive Committee in addition to one student
Executive Committee member already there.

The former move represents a step ahead for students in
their bid for an increased voice in campus affairs. It is, how-
ever, a far cry from a motion defeated by the faculty in the
Fall Term of this school year; that motion would have in-
creased the membership to four students while still giving
the faculty a clear voting majority, a fail-safe, if you will. But
the motion was defeated.

One faculty voice described the adidtion of a student both
committees last week as a move to give the students a great-
er say in university affairs; indeed, the presentation of the
proposals to the faculty by the Facutly EC said the motions
would “maintain a clear and open channel of communication

_ between the student body” and the committees.

Two aspects of last week’s actions merit questioning.
While we are ecstatic that another student will be manning
the C&D Committee in the future, we think last fall’s proposal
of adding three students to that committee would have been
better.

The faculty would still have maintained a clear voting
edge, and there would be opportunity for student input from
four students, not just two. The C&D Committee is a mid-
point between the Student Curriculum Committee and the
faculty, which has final say in all course and degree action.
It only seems reasonable that the C&D should serve as a mid-
point in terms of representation, too. Or at least the division
between students and faculty on that committee should ap-
proach a balance.

As for the defeat of the proposal which would have placed
a second student of the Faculty EC, the question is “Why?”

The Faculty EC itself recomended by a 7-1 vote to the
faculty that the addition be made. And, it seems, the Faculty
EC should know. Again, the faculty would have maintained
a clear voting majority, which it should on the Faculty EC;
and additional communication would have been produced by
the addition.

But the faculty has acted in its own mysterious ways. We
can only thank as we do God for what we’ve got—a small
inroad into solving the communications gap between stu-
dents and faculty at Washington and Lee.

On a student tax proposal

In theory, we commend last week’s Executive Committee
recommendation to allot $5 of the $30 student tax to whatever
the individual student wants to do, within reason, with that
$5.

In practice, however, we damn it. Because it just isn’t
going to work. Somebody hasn’t been doing his homework.

The proposal would leave the general student body fund
with $25. Fine, when compared to this year’s student tax
of $17. That’s $8 more to spend, right? Wrong.

The problem is the allocation of funds to the Student Ac-
tivities Board. This year, only a small portion of that body’s
expenses were paid for by the student tax. The rest was paid
by a sort of loan contracted between the university and the
EC. Also to pay for the SAB, all organizations were asked to
tighten their belts this year, and the publications reserve fund
was wiped out. All this was done on the promise of a return
to normalcy next year.

Our calculations estimate the costs for SAB at around
$10 per student. That, with the $17 student tax, produces a
figure of $27 of the $30 tax needed just to operate next year
comporably with this year’s tight budget, let alone return to
normalcy.

If you haven't figured it out yet, $27 is $2 more than the
$25 the EC budget would have per student if that $5 is taken
out.

It just isn’t going to work.

Fraternities mistreated
Sir:

During the course of my four
years at W&L, I have witnessed
the gradual demise of the frater-
nity system here. Unfortunately,
this has not been a natural pheno-
menon, but rather, one which as
far as I can see has been carefully
planned and carried out by a
small group of independents who
have successfully managed to in-
filtrate and quickly gain control
of the three student publications
of this university.

Having once served as presi-
dent of my own fraternity, I feel
that I can safely speak with ob-
jectivity about this subject.
When I first entered this school
nearly every student leader was
a fraternity man. But now look at

the situation. The only important
organization which is currently
headed by a Greek is the EC,
which until only recently was
controlled by a first year law stu-
dent, from New York no less!
whose candidacy I might add was
blatantly supported by the editors
of the Phi.

(Ed. note: not true!)

Not only that, but when was the
last time your newspaper devoted
any coverage to _ intramural
sports? (Ed. note: during basket-
ball season) Moreover, even the
Calyx refuses to set aside any
rom for the fraternities, preferr-
ing instead to waste space depict-
ing campus “freaks” tossing fris-
bees about or something else aty-
pical of the true W&L. Consequ-
ently, is it any surprise that the
number of freshmen going

through rush has declined over
the years?

Frankly, I am getting a little
fed up with all this. Just because
this small group of pseudo-intel-
lectuals couldn’t get into a fra-
ternity doesn’t mean that they
have the right to completely dis-
regard the frats in terms of ade-
quate coverage in these publica-
tions. After all, if it wasn’t for the
financial support which we give
to the Student Activity Board, the
independents would find them-
selves with little to do on week-
ends except listen to James Tay-
lor through expensive headphones
from home.

Yours very truly,
Beau Dudley, ’74

Additional Ed. Note: Next year’s
editor of the Phi is a fraternity
man, So is next year’s EC presi-

dent, and next year’s head dorm
counselor, and next year’s Calyx
editor, and this year’s Contact co-
chairmen, and this year’s Calyx
editor, and most of next year’s
EC, and so forth.

.. We find it amusing to think
we're conspiring with Doug Sch-
wartz to demean the fraternities.
We find it amusing to think we'd
be conspiring with Doug Schwartz
on any issue,

Sir:

of the University does not seem
to have a spokesman of its own
in the matter, and insofar as too
many errors seem to go uncor-
rected in our several media these

Q—How does one go about applying for financial aid at Washington
and Lee?

A—You can’t be serious. One does not apply for aid at W&L, one whis-
tles Dixie and hopes Marse Robert’s spirit knows the tune,

In the back of the catalogue, there are over one hundred assorted
scholarships listed, with enough collective fiscal clout to send one stu-
dent to this college a dozen times, to purchase five million prints of
Ol’ Lexington from Sally Munger Mann, and have seventy deranged
surgeons hired to disembowel Bob Barker on the air. But just try
applying for one of these financial albatrosses. The conditions at-
tached to these scholarships are so limiting that, unless you are a
crippled penguin with a nervous twitch in one eye, chances for re-
ceiving aid are hopelessly slim.

The types of scholarships offered at W&L range from the simple
work-grant, (involving menial tasks such as majoring in Accounting
or painting fire hydrants), to the full-scale memorial endowments,
most of which are available only to deceased members of the Class of
‘03. Explained Dean Pate, director of student financial aid: “Of course,
these deceased students must still demonstrate financial need, al-
though in the past few of them have stepped foreward, backwards, or
even knocked three times at alumni seances. It’s discouraging, because
1 enjoy giving other people’s money away. Why, I’m the Monte Hall
of Washington Hall!”

The following scholarships have been selected by friendly Dean
Pate for their great student appeal and big cash pay-offs. Take heed,
needy students. Your troubles are over, almost.

***The Elenor Naubrain Limmerick Prize; a gross of Big Chief Tablets
given for the year’s most mindless poem written by a student from
Wisconsin. Example:

“There once was a student named Schwartz,

who won fame for his liberal retorts.
But in Tucker Hall he had sense to straddle the fence
and wear suits over blue denim shorts.”

***The Lucky Duffy Memorial Fund, established in 1960 in grateful
memory of Chester Duffy, sophomore, who was killed by a gaggle of
Canadian geese, attracted by his aftershave. The recipient of this
scholarship must be free, white, and from Cleveland, or nothing doing.
***The Riddle of the Sphinx Scholarship; awarded to that student
successfully answering the question: what’s the difference between
Cortland State and a plate of whipped tapioca? This riddle was created
by cunning policemen in Boston to browbeat confessions out of har-
dened criminals. Amount: $25, plus a sapling planted in the student’s
name along Interstate 64.
***The W&L Gaffe Award; given to that student committing the least
pardonable gaucherie while in the act of running for office. This
year’s winner: Doug Ford, candidate for senior UC, who used paper
ripped out of a note-book for campaign posters. 2nd place: John Paul
Woodley, for wearing Ocedar sponge suits during his city council bid.
Amount: $10, and a genuine Wendell Wilkie pennant.

Q—Well, what is the difference between Cortland State and a plate of
whipped tapioca?
A—The plate.

Dear Traveller:

In last week’s column you published a complaint from Simp Tho-
mas, who said I left him in Kenya with a gang of gorillas. Mr. Thomas
was not a reguiar W&L student on the African Safari. He assured
the Dean he was taking leave from the White House staff for reasons
of national security and wanted an inconspicuous way to leave the
country.

I tried to find a suitable “cover” for him, but I admit—and it
would be wrong not to admit — that my choice of a gorilla gang was
based on a misunderstanding: I thought his name was Chimp.

If Simp wants back his job, I won't stand in his way.

‘Dig’ to continue

through summer

An archaeological “dig” at the
171-year-old ruins of Liberty Hall
Academy in Lexington will con-
tinue through the summer, and
men and women of high-school
age and above are invited to par-
ticipate for academic credit
through Virginia Military Instit-
ute’s summer school program.

The course is taught by Dr.
John M. McDaniel, assistant an-
thropology professor at Washing-
ton and Lee University, who has
been conducting the “dig” this
spring with students in his archa-
eological field techniques course
at W&L,

Liberty Hall was the first Lex-
ington home of Washington and
Lee’s predecessor institution.

Built in 1793, it burned Christmas
Eve, 1802, whereupon the school

moved to its present location a
mile closer to town. The ruins
have been preserved at the west
edge of the W&L campus.

The “dig” is being carried out
in conjunction with W&L’s
American Bicentennial program,
and expectations are that evi-
dence to be unearthed will shed
new light on academic and stu.
dent life at the institution at the
end of the eighteenth century.

An analysis

Thursday, May 16, 1974

Another exchange approved

by JESS REEVES
Last week the faculty approved
an exchange program with Vir-
ginia Union University in Rich-
mond to begin next year. One is
inclined to question how desir-
able such an exchange program
is for Washington and Lee.
Virginia Union University is a
predominantly black institution.
lf the goal of the exchange pro-
gram is to offer new environmen-
tal experience for the student and
diversity to the student body then
an exchange program with a
black intsitution is understand-
able.
If the first and foremost goal
of W&L is academic excellence

then this particular exchange will
add little to the schoo] and could
prove to be detrimental.

The faculty did not simply ac-
cept an exchange program to
bring more blacks here but enter-
ed into a consortium with a schoo]
whose academic standards are far
below those of this institution. As
a matter of fact Va. Union falls
far below all of the other schools
with which Washington and Lee
exchanges students.

According to the Comparative
Guide to American Colleges, 1973,
the average SAT scores for fresh-
men at Va. Union are 320 verbal,
340 math. The average SAT scores
for a}] the other schools in the ex-

Luce awards offer
a year's study in Asia

Washington and Lee’s Graduate
Fellowships Committee, will se-
lect nominees for the Henry A.
Luce Scholars program early next
fall, according to Dr. Robert W.
MeAhren, associate dean of the
Coilege. Students who are in-
terested in participating in the
Luce Foundation’s Asian studies
program are invited to make in-
quiries through him.

As many as four W&L nomi-
nees may be proposed. Those se-
jected by the Foundation will re-
ceive a $9,000 stipend for a year’s
postgraduate study in Asia ($11,-
(00 for married Luce Scholars).
The foundation will also provide
air transportation and certain in-
surance benefits as well.

Students must be seniors or law
students when they apply (re-

cent graduates are eligible as
well), between the ages of 21 and
30. According to the Luce Founda-
tion, “nominees should have a
strong, mature and clearly defin-
ed career interest in a specific
field”—except that specialists in
Asian affairs or international re-
lations are ineligible. Academic
achievement is also an important
factor, the foundation advises.

W&L is one of 60 prestigious
schools in America which have
been invited to participate in the
Luce program, which will begin
its first year of operation next
vear .No academic credit accom-
panies the program, but intern-
ships and similar job-study ar-
rangements will be made in the
fields of each Luce Scholar’s in-
terest.

change program are well over 500
and W&L’s scores are very close
to 600, about double those for Va.
Union.

This is what could kindly be
called bending over backwards.

The most important goal for
this institution is achieving aca-
demic excellence. All other con-
siderations, i.e., diversity of the
student body, must be secondary
to this.

Any of our students who go to
Va. Union will be able to rub
shoulders with blacks but they
Will also receive credit for sitting
in classes which are designed for
students who can not move as
fast as W&L students. If they do
survive the boredom they wil]
not learn as much as they would
here, to say the least.

Virginia Union will supposedly
send members of their student
body here who can do the work.
This is an unsigned and informal
agreement. Certainly they will
not allow students to come here
who they do not think can make
it academically, but W&L must
rely on their good faith and judg-
ment. There is really no way to
say what they will ship to Lex-
ington.

If this school is interested in
bringing more blacks to this cam-
pus then a black school of com-
parable standing might be found.
Otherwise W&L is sacrificing its
good name. In the last analysis it
is up to our Admissions Office to
find their own competent black
recruits,

Washington and Lee has an
image and standards which should
be maintained, and an exchange

bumping into Judger as they tried
to blast through a hole in the
the wall, broke his leg and will
probably be destroyed. It was the
largest field ever.

The race was attended by Prin-
cess Margaret and Lord Snowdon,
who saw Cannonade flash to glory
and eternal recognition. It was a
horse race to remember, I sup-
pose, but I was in the infield and
didn’t see a horse all day.

I did hear one, though, once.
After I got through the grand-
stand gates, plunking down my
five dollars, I progressed about 75
yards into the tunnel. The tunnel

track and leads into the oval in-

the track, packed with several
thousand other people, the pound-
ing hooves of the first race sound-
ed over our heads.

The second race went off (I
heard the bell) forty minutes lat-
er, and I had progressed another
hundred yards to a clear spot. On
my left, about fifteen guys got
into a styrofoam cooler-smashing
an bottle-throwing fight, as I sat
down. One of the group bared his
essentials to a camera carrying
older man, and they all laughed
at that. The bottles were getting
close, so I moved on another fifty
yards, found another clear patch
of unblanketed grass, and sat
down to watch the circus.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

 

by BILL FLESHER

Washington and Lee gave two
more lessons in lacrosse last
week, and, in the process, gave
the rest of the lacrosse world fair
warning that they are ready for
the NCAA lacrosse Champion-
ships, which begin Saturday with
four quarterfinal matches.

Franklin and Marshall took last
Wednesday’s pointers as the Gen-
erals piled up a 14-1 lead, then
emptied the bench and coasted to
a 19-11 win.

Saturday W&L completed its
second perfect regular season in
a row as Cortland State, the third-
ranked college division ten, in-
vaded Lexington with hopes of
proving General’s coach Jack Em-
mer wrong for leaving the up-
state New York school for W&L,
but instead went home more
aware of what makes a lacrosse
team great, in addition to being
14-+ losers.

“For all concerned, both games
were good ones for us,” said Em-
mer after Saturday’s contest.

“I think that we are now ready
to go into the tournament and
play the outstanding lacrosse I
know we are capable of.”

W&L wasted no time in assum-
nig control of both of last week’s
games.

The Generals scored four times

before the Diplomats’ Paul Long
could break the ice for F&M. Af-
ter that, however, F&M’s attack-
men didn’t do much as W&L rat-
tled of ten straight goals in 13
minutes.

In acordance with NCAA rules,
there will be a $3 admision charge
for adults and a $2 admission
charge for students at Saturday’s
lacrosse game against Navy.

Senior attackman Bill Rienhoff
led the barrage with four of his
game-high five goals, while Dave
Warfield, the Generals’ leading
scorer, added three of his four
goals and three assists.

Skip Lichtfuss and sophomore
Jim Englehart added hat tricks
for W&L in the Generals’ 13th
win of the year.

Goalie Skeet Chadwick left the
game midway through the second
period, allowing Malcolm Hast-
ings and freshman Todd Galvin to
gain valuable playing time.

Emmer praised F&M for their
second-half comeback which at
one time brought the Diplomats
back to trail by only 17-10.

“I think they came down here
awed by our tradition, which is
why they got off to such a shaky
start,” Emmer said. “But once we
pulled our regulars, they rallied
and showed some good stick-
work.”

Thursday,

Saturday’s opponent, however,
held no fears. Cortland State had
been looking forward toward
their confrontation with W&L
since the day the game was sch-
eduled.,

Several months ago a columnist
in the Cortland campus newspap-
“for the real championship of
er labeled the game the match
college division lacrosse,” pitting
the 1973 college division titlehold-
er against the then only college
division team to play in the
NCAA tournament,

If that was the case, the champ
was crowned early.

The Generals played as near a
perfect fifteen minutes of la-
crosse as could be played in the
opening quarter Saturday.

While Chadwick and defense-
men Jim Farrar, Tom Keigler,
and Rob Lindsey were allowing
Cortland’s attackmen only an oc-
casional catch and throw, W&L
was keeping the Dragon defense
plenty busy.

Bryan Chasney opened the scor-
ing at 3:52 when he took a War-
field feed and fired it past Cort-
land netminder Pete Graham.
Thirty-six seconds later, fresh-
man Mick Kohlenstein made an-
other Warfield pass good, and it
was 2-0.

Ken Miller, who played despite
an injured knee, tallied as he cut
through the middle at 5:11 to up it
to 3-0. Goals by Chasney and John
Lalley later in the quarter gave
W&L a surprising 5-0 edge after
the first fifteen.

“We were more ready to play
at the start of the game than we
had been in past games,” Emmer
said. “We put Cortland behind
early, which we had to do.”

Defense on both sides dominat-
ed in the second quarter. Some
superb goaltending by both Chad-
wick and Graham kept the fans
buzzing for the better part of the
period.

All of the scoring in the quarter
came in the final five minutes.
Two extra-man goals by Ted Bau-
er, one on the “crank” and the
other after a Chasney feed, put
W&L ahead 7-0. Late in the quar-
ter, Paul McGee and Jim Luch-

singer got the Dragons on the
scoreboard, and the team went to
the locker room with the Gen-
erals holding a 7-2 advantage.

Cortland scored first after inter-
mission, as Jim Tarnow beat
Chadwick to cut the lead to 7-3.
But that was the closest the visit-
ors would get.

After Lalley intercepted a
clearing attempt, Jack Dudley
scored to make it 8-3. Then Chas-
ney got his third, Miller his sec-
ond, and Bauer his third, again on
the extra-man, to put the game
out of the Dragons’ reach.

Miller added his third tally to
open the fourth quarter. Jim Bur-
nett got Cortland’s final goal, but
goals by Warfield, who finished
with four assists, and Don Carroll
gave W&L their final margin of
victory.

Chadwick, fully recovered from
the virus that plagued him earlier
in the season, played brilliantly in
goal, making 26 saves, several
from the point blank range.

At the other end Graham wasn't
bad either. The Cortland cage cop
turned away a number of shots,
and could have been charged with
robbery on several occasions.

But the key could have been
the W&L defense, which, in set-
tled situations, didn’t allow Cort-
land’s attackmen a single goal.
Not only did Farrar, Lindsey, and
Keigler play good individual de-
fense, but the team defense was
at its best.

Was Emmer nervous about hav-
ing to face his old team?

“Sure I was a bit uptight about
it,’ he said after the game. “But
the team started quickly, which
relieved the pressure just about
as fast.”

As for the tournament......
To the surprise of many, Wash-
ington and Lee drew the number
three seed for the NCAA Lacrosse

Championships, which pits the
Generals against Navy in the
quarterfinals for the second

straight year.

Defending champion Maryland,
who were upset Saturday by
Johns Hopkins 17-13, landed the

Baseball team
ends season

at 7-10 mark

by BILL AUSTIN

The baseball Generals ended
the season in a fashion befitting
the up-and-down kind of cam-
paign experienced. They were
rained out. Thus, a spring of pro-
mise spawned a final won-lost
total of 7-10 and expectations for
an improved squad next year.

Nevertheless, the achievements
of the just-completed season
should not be overlooked in the
rush to herald a brighter future
for W&L baseball. Junior co-cap-
tain Don Hathway led the club’s
hitting with a .297 average while
John Rice swatted a respectable
275 and knocked home 11 runs.

Dan Westbrook and Rod Ferr-
andino gave the team two-thirds

have in order to compete consis- |

tently on a college-length sche-
dule. Ferrandino’s 3-4 record
matched last year’s total, though
the junior right hander’s efforts
were impeded and finally defeat-
ed by a bout with mono. West-
brook’s statistics—a 3-3 won-lost
mark, a team-leading 3.30 ERA—
are impressive, and his future
could be even brighter if he mas-
ters a reliable curve. Certainly,
his durability was tested and pro-
ven, for he hurled 60 innings.
Coach Lyles seems to have
brought together a competent in-
field with Hathway at third base,
Bonaventura at shortstop, Otey
second and Rice at first. Bona-
ventura’s fielding was particular-
ly aggressive and sure-handed. He
led the team in fielding assists.
With a tribute to the strengths
must also come an acknowledg-
nent of the shortcomings. Surely,
, dearth of basehits put constant
pressure on the moundsmen and
the defense. While opponents gar-
ered six runs per game, General
iitters swung at an anemic .194
clip, good for a little more than
three tallies a contest. No W&L
yiaver hit more than a single

top seed, while the Blue
grabbed the second spot.

Many observers expected W&L
to be in one of the top two spots,
since the Generals, at 14-0, are
the only undefeated team in the
nation. The Generals had also
beaten two teams, Virginia and
Navy, who had beaten Hopkins,
which gave further reason to be-
lieve that W&L would be seeded
ahead of the Blue Jays.

However the selection commit-
tee saw it otherwise.

So the Generals will play the
Midshipmen, with former W&L
mentor Dick Szlasa at the con-
trols, for the third time in the
last year.

WE&L, on Chip Tompkins’ me-
morable goal in sudden death
overtime, eliminated Navy in
1973’s quarterfinals 13-12. Earlier
this year, the Generals held the
Middies scoreless for 26 minutes
in the second half en route to a
3-10 win at Annapolis.

top seeded Maryland against num-
ber eight Rutgers at College Park;
number two Johns’ Hopkins

five roundtrippers for the season.

Undeniably, the depth-shy pitch-
ing staff and hitting blues pre-
sent significant obstacles to be
overcome if W&L fortunes are
truly bound for an upward turn.
Yet, there is cause for hope. Chip
Costello is the only player to be
lost through graduation from the
current squad, and a year’s ex-
perience should boost confidence
at the plate for returning General
batters. As for pitching, freshman
Bob Carpentier turned in an en-
couraging performance in his
final start and could provide a
