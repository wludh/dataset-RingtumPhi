Generals top Wahoos, 13-11
Page 2 THE RING-TUM PHI

A little fable

(Reprinted, with a few up to date changes, from last year’s Ring-
tum Phi.)

Once unon a time there was a sleepy little school in a sleepv
little town in a beautiful and green valley with mountains all around.
The students at the school were like those anywhere else—some
slept all the time, some played, others walked around with their
noses buried in big thick books. During the spring there seemed to
he fewer and fewer with their noses in books: most bought inner
tubes and spent their Saturday afternoons floating in big pools of
heer or Southern Comfort.

Alas, it seemed for a long time that none of these boys could
become interested in anything but reading or floating all day long.
Until one dav one got the bright idea of tving a net on the end
of a pole and tossing a ball with it. Soon everyone in the little
town was running up and down the football field, waving their
sticks, hitting each other with them, and having a glorious time.

Then, word of the Wahoos came to town. No one knew what a
Wahoo was or where the Wahoos came from. They carried sticks
just the same. tossed the ball quickly from one to the other—and
the neonle in the little town were sore afraid.

Then the people said, “Why don’t we leave our books and our
inner tubes and join together to beat back these Wahoos?” And it
was done. The books were tossed aside and the lovely pools were
drunk drv—and everyone gathered together and travelled to the
lnir of the Wahoos to end their threat, once and for all. The battle
hegan.

The Wahoos looked mean and fierce. Most people thought the
Wahoos were meaner and fiercer than the people of the sleepy little
school. But as the battle began, a Skeeter gritted his teeth and said,
“The Wahoos aren’t that tough.” And sending their Teddv, their
Skipper, and all the rest downfield, the people of the beautiful and
green vallev beat the Wahoos and showed them who was meaner
and tougher.

It is said that the people of the sleenvv little school] will never be
the same again. They are no longer afraid of anyone. They have
their Skeeter, their Teddy, their Skipper, and all the rest. And they
have a reason to drink up those beautiful little pools of beer and
Southern Comfort. The End.

 

Helping town-gown relations

The next time someone comes up to you and tells you that Wash-
ington and Lee students are a kind of parasitic horde which has
descended uvon Lexington, not caring what happens to the city
as long as they themselves are satisfied, consider this:

Earlier this month, senior John Zamoiski spotted a local resident
dumping a bag of garbage on North Main Street in Lexington from
his moving station wagon. Zamoiski followed the local resident
stopped him, and asked him to pick up the garbage. The resident
refused.

Zamoiski said he would have the resident arrested unless he
picked up the garbage, at which point the resident went to his place
of business and locked himself in.

The W&L senior swore out a warrant at the Lexington police
station and took the officers out to pick up the garbage as evidence.
Tneluded among the garbage was a quantitv of broken glass, great
for automobile tires.

The resident was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of littering,
and he posted $35.25 bond. He forfeited that bond.

As Zamoiski said, “The students always get blamed for the trash
around town.”

Perhaps the merit of this little incident is just that it shows not
all students are really out to destroy Lexington. Whether all students
erally care anything about Lexington is doubtful. But at least this
incident points to the situation that, although there may be students
who don’t care anything about Lexington, there seem to be some
Lexingtonians who should share equally in the disfavor of proud
Lexington residents.

Yet we fear the student “aggression” against the city will be that
which is cited by the townspeople, while those within the borders
f the “friends and kinfolk” wall around Lexington will be forgiven
end forgotten without second thought.

Ask Traveller

Next week marks the first anniversary of Al Black’s rise to
prominence as W&L’s most mundane man or, more popularly referred
to in Moslem car lots, as, St. Alvin the Lackluster. This inoffensive
senior from Davis Dorm so dazzled his peers with his docile spirit,
bland character, and inability to part his hair from the left, that he
won nocturnal accolades from last year’s student body and the
unprecedented honor of having a schoolday set aside in his name,
as well as a $25 scholarship in the Lasalle Extension’s graduate pro-
gram of motel management and the proper feeding of yak.

But Al Black is now gone, we think. At least he’s not in his room.
To fill the immense void left by Al’s graduation, a new student must
be selected from the ranks of W&L. Four fellows were recently
nominated for the great distinction in a closed session of the Rock-
bridge Garden Club’s executive and pruning council. With its per-
mission, I present the names to you today with thumbnail resumes.
The selections took approximately three minutes, in between the
Club’s old business and break for refreshments.

*Ben “Scuds” Cherman, ’75: student government secretary; la-
crosse team manager; special assistant to no one in particular; minor-
ing in being seen; listed in Who's Who in Vocational Schools and
Bldg. & Ground as being the same height as Napoleon; enjoys im-
personating John the Baptist at EC tubing parties “though I prefer
cold cuts to wild honey and locusts;” favorite C-School topic—“Is
Morality C.0O.D. or what?

*Ted “Two-tone”? Amshoff, ’74; vigorous Young Republican and
the campus authority on Caldwell Butler’s farm policy in Henrico
County; appeared in the last issue of the Lampoon as a subscription
blank; considered to have the loudest shirt and tie combinations in
Lexington; voted New Jersey’s best dressed mannequin award in 1972.

*Wayne “Hottip” Baker, ’74: WLUR henchman; current events
expert with the power of his convictions and the raucous voice to
back them up; covered the Mock Convention from a closet in Art
Silver’s haberdashery with seven dozen plaid shirts and a trout fish-
ing license; gained regional fame by tossing out the first cadet at
the New Market Reenactment last year; challenged Dean Farrar to
reveal the name of his barber or favorite charity in famous campus
confrontation.

*Kevin “No-further-questions” Murray, ’77; infamous chairman of
the randomly-selected honor trial jury, who succinctly differentiated
between “honor before guilt,” “intent without honor,” “honor with-
out intent or guilt,” and “bacon and lettuce—hold the mayo”; enjoys
listening to leaves fall in the autumn.

So there they are, the four nominees for Al Black Day in 1974.
Do with them what ve will but give me Barabbas. The winner wil!
be given the ceremonial key to Lake Huron and the 4-H bestseller:
Guano Go Home? The Guide to Fowlfeathered Fertilizer and Other
Crap. The student selected, who refuses to accept these lovely part-
ing gifts, will be given the kev to Lake Superior, as well, and forced
to perform unnatural acts with a lamprey eel.

Town and gown differences
set aside in Outing Club

By PAUL MORELLA

Initiated last spring for the
purpose of taking advantage of
the outdoor opportunities avail-
able in the Rockbridge County

area, the Outing Club has become
active in the Lexington com-
munity.

Oriented towards all people, the
Outing Club not only offers in-
formation on game facilities, but
also facilitates contact between
students and townspeople.

The club is comprised of about
90 members, including students
from W&L and VMI, as well as
members of the Lexington com-
munity. A six-man steering com-
mittee, made up of those people
who played a substantial role in
the development of the club were
elected by the membership at
large as a sort of executive body
which loosely runs the club. The
six persons are: senior Bill Wal-
lace; junior Greg Amonette; law
student Fran Lawrence; W&L
faculty member, John McDaniel;
and two members of the Lexing-
ton community, Chris Murray
and Don Firebaugh.

According to Amonette, the most
active segment of the club thus
far has been the hunting, fish-
ing and conservation aspects. For
example, through the club, the
Hays Creek fishing club was
formed, over 2,000 autumn olive,
bicolor, and lespedia_ wildlife
shrubs were planted, and many
other programs geared towards
improving our natural habitat
were initiated.

In addition the Outing Club
hosts a number of monthly pro-
grams and_ outside activities,
which included such things as
field trials for bird dogs, a pro-
gram on wild turkey in the area,

a fly-tying clinic, and a seminar
on conservation to name some of

THE RING-TUM PHI Page 3
This spring, members of the

Outing Club have been toying

with many ideas and have sug-

the more successful activities of
the club.

“It seems that when we have
a feature to offer, such as the
wild turkey meeting,” stated Dr.
McDaniel, “the meetings are well
attended. But when we don’t have
as much to offer, the attendance
is disappointing.” Dr. McDanie]
continued, ‘There are so many
opportunities available to us that
we must take advantage of them.
This organization can at least pro-
vide the student with the in-
formation concerning our sur-
roundings.”

“The ultimate goal of the Out-
ing Club” feels Fran Lawrence,
“is to bring things to the campus
that interest people as well as
trving to provide a forum for the
encouragement and advancement
of outdoor activities.” In addition,
Fran feels that another goal of
the club is to establish an office
type situation somewhere in the
city of Lexington. Right now, the
club meets in a room at the W&L
Student Center.

every Monday and Thursday in
the Student Center.

Reflecting on the season so far,

Coach Davies commented,
“Things are going pretty well.

The team is composed of eight

asked to leave W&L

year short of tenure

By ROBERT COOK

Assistant Professor of Drama
O. K. Barnes III has been notified
bv the administration he will not
be asked to return to the uni-
versity after this next year.

Barnes said he received a letter
from Dean Watt two weeks ago
informing him his employment
with Washington and Lee Uni-
sersity would be terminated
August 1975, one vear short of
tenure.

Barnes said Monday he had met
with Dean Watt and President
Huntley after receiving the letter
to discuss the reasons for their
decision. After the discussions
Barnes said he felt the action had
been based on “hearsay, the opin-

Following school policy Dean
Watt would not comment on any
aspect of a professor’s relation
to the university. Dr. Robert
Stewart, acting head of the fine
arts department, would say that
the decision in no way reflected
on Barnes’ skills as a set designer,
which Stewart praised highly.

Stewart said that the reasons
for Barnes’ dismissal were educa-
tional in nature.

At the moment Barnes said he
is awaiting a written reply to a
letter he sent to the administra-

tion requesting the _ specific
charges against him be spelled
out.

Barnes said he felt that while
it was “probably too late to alter
the administration’s decision, the
university has a right to have the
facts set out in the open.”

The

By BILL FLESHER

With a national television audi-
ence and the largest crowd ever
ta see a lacrosse game in Virginia
looking on, Washington and Lee
jumped out to an early 3-0 lead,
then held off a late Virginia rally
to down the Cavaliers, 13-11, in
Charlottesville Saturday.

It marked the second straight
vear that the Generals had “up-
set,” to use the term loosely,
their lacrosse archrivals, and it
proved that Washington and Lee
is a national power that will have
to be reckoned with.

Last year W&L, behind Ted
Bauer’s six goals, Skip Lichtfuss’
three goals and three assists, and
the superb goal tending of Skeet
Chadwick, sent a defending na-
tional champion Cavalier unit
home 15-11 losers.

But this year things were dif-
ferent. The scene had been chang-
ed to Scott Stadium, and it was
to be the Wahoos who were out
for revenge.

The Cavaliers got close, but
never could make the big move
when they needed it.

“We were sloppy at times, but
we always had enough to win,”
said W&L head coach Jack
Emmer after the game.

“We have definitely had better
stick-handling games than we did
against Virginia,” Emmer added,
citing the Navy game as the Gen-
erals’ best outing of the year.

Freshman midfielder Jack Dud-
ley led W&L scorers with three
goals, all in the second half.
Lichtfuss and Don Carroll added
two goals apiece, while the Gen-
erals’ leading scorer Dave War-
field threw in one goal and as-
sisted on three others.

Dudley, who is on the “blue”
midfield with Bauer and John

Lalley, benefited from the Vir-
ginia strategy to stop Bauer and
Lichtfuss “no matter what.”

“No matter where Teddy or I
were, there would be at least one
middie staring us in the face,”
Lichtfuss said. “Even if we were
out of the play, the middie would
still be there, which opened things
up for our other guys.”

The Generals lost the opening
faceoff (they ended up winning
only 10 of the 29 faceoffs), but
did not allow Virginia to get off
a shot. Lichtfuss then took con-
trol in the attacking end, and
seored unassisted to open the
scoring at 2:20. Goals by Bill
Rienhoff (at 2:58) and Don Car-
roll (at 8:34) made it 3-0, and, for
the time, it looked like it might
not be a contest.

“We played our best lacrosse in
the first ten minutes,” Emmer
said. “It took Virginia eight
minutes to get off their first
shot, which is an indication of
how good our defense can be.”

But the Cavaliers refused to
fold. Freshman midfielder Rich-
ard Krol! scored at 13:25 to make
it 3-1. Thirty seconds later, Barry
Robertson, the Wahoos’ leading
screr, tallied to cut the margin to
3-2 after one period.

W&L opened the second quarter
with another three-goal spurt to
extend their lead to 6-2. Bauer
fired a hard shot past Virginia
goalie Rodney Rullman at 1:05,
then Carroll and Lichtfuss scored
their second goals within 16 sec-
onds of each other midway
through the period.

But again the Generals could
not stop the Wahoos late in the
period. Kroll scored his second
at 13:57 to cut the lead to 6-3.
With only :12 left in the half,
Robertson broke up a W&L clear-

ing attempt and fired into an
empty net, making it a 6-4 game
at the half.

After Lalley and Robertson
traded goals early in the third
stanza to make the score 7-5, the
Generals launched their third
three-goal splurge. Dudley got his
first at 2:31, followed by fresh-
man Chris Larson at 8:24, and
Bryan Chasney at 11:48. W&L
then led 10-5, and again threat-
ened to runaway from the Cava-
liers.

But again Virginia fought back,
this time with a three-goal spurt
of their own. Josh Pons scored at
13:02 of the third to make it 10-6,
then Stan Dorney, who had a part
in all five of Virginia’s fourth
period goals, and Doug Cooper
scored early in the final quarter
to cut the Generals lead to 10-8.

Dudley, on a brilliant one-on-

enerals dump Virginia

one move, made it 11-8 at 4:36.
But Virginia’s Paul Marchiano
scored at 6:52 to make it 11-9.

Then W&L moved to slam the
door on the Wahoos. Warfield,
after losing the ball near the
crease, picked it up and threw it
by an out-of-position Rullman at
9:40 to up the lead to 12-9, Then
Dudley got his third goal on a
feed from Carroll to give the
Generals a 13-9 lead.

Owen Daly and Dorney scored
for Virginia in the final seconds
but by then, the outcome had
been decided.

“We had several chances to put
them away, but we never took
advantage,” Emmer said. “They
never folded, but we helped by
letting them off the hook a few
times.”

And it happens again next year
—on Wilson Field.

Lacrosse notes

By BILL FLESHER

Though Washington and Lee
won THE game against Virginia
Saturday, the 1974 season is far
from being over. Five games re-
main on the Generals’ slate, all
with teams from the college di-
vision. And, just because the op-
ponents are referred to as being
“small schools” doesn’t mean that
the rest of the season will be a
cakewalk for W&L.

Among the Generals’ foes are
three of the best college division
teams in the nation—top-ranked
Towson State (April 27), number
three Cortland State (May 11),
and second-ranked Washington
College (May 4).

Also left for W&L are games
with Roanoke College on April
30 and Franklin and Marshall on
May 8.

All five games are home con-
tests for W&L, which is a big
advantage as the season draws to
a close.

were even more upsetting, as the

that someone would explain the

down Towson State, they’re not

Baseball squad ends losing skein

By BILL AUSTIN
Scores:

W&L 5—Madison 9

W&L 10—Lynchburg Baptist 1

Following a tough loss to Madi-
son College last Thursday, the
baseball Generals broke a 7-game
losing streak with a thrashing of
Lynchburg Baptist. Possessors of
a modest 6-7 won-lost record for
the season to date, the squad thus
awaited news of the VCAA’s picks
for its four-team tournament,
scheduled this coming Saturday.

Madison appeared a sure choice
for one of the two spots available
for Western Division teams, with
Lynchburg College another prob-
able selection. However, W&L
clung to an outside chance of
securing the second spot, based
on the merit of its schedule, cer-
tainly a more challenging one
than has been Lynchburg’s. A
decision was expected Wednes-
day.

In the game at Madison, the
Generals stayed even with their
powerful opponents into the 6th
inning, when Madison left fielder
Billy Sample drilled a bases-load-
ed triple off pitcher Rod Fer-
randino. The hit highlighted a 4-
run rally which staked the Dukes
to a 7-3 lead.

W&L came back in the 7th
with singles by Otey and Costello,
and a double by Lancaster. With
one run already in, pinch-runner
Jack Herron apparently beat the
Madison throw to the plate on
Lancaster’s hit. The umpire deem-
ed otherwise. The inning and the
General threat ended when Bon-
aventura whiffed.

The Generals closed the gap to

7-5 in the 8th, when Hathway
doubled and came home on a
Rheault single. Unfortunately,
Madison hitters tagged relief
pitcher Carpentier for a pair of
bizarre solo home runs. The first
did not clear the outfield fence,
but rather passed under it, only
to be ruled a legitimate round-
tripper. The second was a well-
hit single which bounced over
centerfielder Lancaster’s head.

For Ferrandino, the loss was
his third straight. Jim Barbe went
the distance for Madison, yield-
ing eight General hits, striking
out 10.

Monday, the team returned to
Lexington, hosting Lynchburg
Baptist in a contest originally
scheduled for Saturday. The Gen-
erals pounced on Baptist starter
Rich Zazuetta for seven runs in
the second inning to turn the
affair into a Jaugher. Chip Cos-
tello’s homer keyed the scoring
outburst, but the cause was aided
handily when Lynchburg third-
sacker Bill Johns committed two
errors.

On the mound, Dan Westbrook
registered a complete game, limit-
ing his foes to a single first-in-
ning tally while striking out 10
batters. Defensive support, par-
ticularly in the infield, was good,
as Hathway and Otey seemed bet-
ter adjusted to their positions at
third and second base, respecti-
vely. On the contrary, Lynch-
burg’s infielders staged an exhibi-
tion in folly, booting grounders
and exercising questionable judg-
ment in key situations. Not un-
happily, the Generals play this
same squad again in May.
