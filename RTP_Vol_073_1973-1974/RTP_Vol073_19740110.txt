will perform here

The National Shakespeare Com-
pany will present William Shake-
speares “As You Like It” Friday,
Jan. 18 at 8:50 p.m. in new Dore-
mus Gymnasium.

iHe—piay 1s sponsored py the
Culture Committee of the Student
Activities Board.

Tickets for the play may be ob-
tained in the Washington and
Lee Bookstore, Tickets are $2 in
advance and $2.50 at the door.

“As you Like It” is a comedy
concerning the trials and tribula-
tions of love. The forest of Arden
is the setting of the romance,
away from the political world of
the Court. Here a Duke dethroned
bv his brother who lives in exile
with a small crew of followers.

Jan. 18 in Doremus

Through various circumstances
many others are soon inhabitants
of the forest. Among the newcom-
ers are the Duke’s daughter,
Rosalind his niece, and Orlando
who is in love with Rosalind.

Once the main characters of the
play have moved from Court to
country the involvement of the
plot become evident. Rosalind
and her cousin escape in disguise,
thus Orlando does not recognize
them. The complications are a re-
sult of this deception on the part
of the women. In this play the
characters create their own prob-
lems and almost lose control of
the situation. However, all is fin-
ally revealed, and the play ends
on a happy note with the promise
of feasting and weddings.

Former students convicted
of drug distribution here
reed over winter break

Seven former Washington and
Lee students and three Lexing-
ton area men sentenced last vear
for distribution of illegal drugs
were released from prison over
the holiday break.

The 10 were released Dec. 22
after Judge Paul A. Holstein sign-
ed orders suspending the remain-
der of the jail terms for the men.

The men were arrested in a
drug raid by state and local po-
lice one year ago last November
and were sentenced last spring
and summer.

The former Washington and
Lee students released are Dan E.
Silberberg, Joel H. Holt, Kevin
P. Darby, Alan D. Corwith, Wil-
liam G. Hummer, Douglas B.
Bruell, and Jeffrey A. Rosenberg.

Bruell and Rosenberg were re-
leased after paying $7,334 and $7,-
403 in fines, respectively.

The three area men released
were Stanley B. Coffey of Buena
Vista and Kenneth L. Gilliam and
Carlton D. Shiflett of Glasgow.

The men have all been placed
on probation for periods ranging
from three to 30 years.

All 10 were serving 12 month
terms, except for Rosenberg and
Giliam, who were each sentenced
to 24 months. All were eligible for

parole after serving eight months

Two other men arrested in the
November drug raid, Wayne L
Carter and Donald Lynn of Buena
Vista, are currently serving five
vear terms in the state penitenti-
ary.

Judge Holstein said he had re-
ceived favorable reports on the
10 released men from probation
and corrections officials, and he
felt supervision in custody was no
longer necessary and further in-
carceration could be detrimental.

Most of the men were serving
their terms at Bland Correctiona!
Farm. Silberberg, serving former-
lv at Bland, was moved to Rock:
bridge County Jail, while Coffey
was sent to the Dublin Correction-
al Unit.

A special grand jury in Novem.
ber, 1972, indicted a total of 1!
men following a year-long investi-
gation by state police.

Judge Holstein ordered the fo!-
lowing probational requirements
for the men:

That the defendant be of goo
behavior during the probation:
which means he shall not inten-
tionally violate any law; and

That the defendant not engage
in drug traffic in any manner:

|OUTLOOK and REVIEW
The Honor System changes

Elsewhere on this page, you will find an article, a letter to the stu-
dent body, from the Executive Committee explaining why the Honor
System “White Book,” as it is so bureaucratically labeled, was distri-
buted to students when Winter Term schedules were handed out.

We realize that the average life of those books when they were hand-
ed out was from the registrar’s office to the nearest wastepaper basket,
but we suggest you take time out to read both the book and the EC’s
letter, for some very significant changes have taken place, changes
which, of course, this year’s EC made without any input whatsoever
from the student body, without any publicity of the fact that changes
were being made in the Honor System, without any minds other than
those of the EC and a few close associates to decide for the entire uni-
versity how the Honor System should operate.

Several of the changes we heartily welcome. For example, the presi-
dent of the Student Bar Association will replace the EC president in
the position of chairman in a student body hearing. Previously, it was
rather questionable that the EC president, who took an active role in
determining the student’s guilt in the closed hearing, should preside
over the open hearings.

Also, a full transcript of the closed hearing will be available to mem-
bers of the jury in the open hearing. This, hopefully, will aid in the
presentation of all the pertinent data to the members of the jury.

We must, however, question several changes made by the EC,
changes which, without any input from the non-EC student body, seem
to strengthen the EC’s position as “prosecutor” in an open honor trial.

One change stipulates that a summary of the closed hearing com-
piled by an EC member, will be written up for presentation as evidence
at the open hearing. The “prosecution,” if you will, seems much stren-
gthened by this move, much to the despair of the convicted student,
who seeks a public honor trial beyond the realm of the EC men who
have already convicted him.

Another change seems to harass the student into accepting the EC’s
closed session decision and rejecting an open honor trial. If the student
withdraws before the EC hearing or after that hearing and before a
public trial, his transcript will say only that he has withdrawn from
the university. But if he is found guilty in the public honor trial, his
transcript will read that he withdrew from the university following a
student body honor hearing, which is to say he was kicked out. And
any student would have a lot easier time getting into another school if
he withdrew from than if he were kicked out of Washington and Lee.
Maybe this is how it should be, but the line drawn by the EC between
withdrawal and being kicked out seems to be drawn at a point favoring
the EC, and not the student, perhaps “convincing” that student to con-
form with the EC’s decision rather than face virtual expulsion.

Thus, it seems to us that the EC’s chances of looking good because
its conviction of a student was upheld in a public honor trial are en-
hanced by these changes in the Honor System, changes, again, which
were made without any approval from the student body as a whole.

We think it is fine that the EC undertake such a task such a re-
vision of the Honor System, and we are (fairly) certain that its mo-
tives were good. But one EC’s good intentions might be an innocent
man’s demise, simply because the inbreeding of thought within the EC
has brought about, in less than a year of existence, the classical de-
fects of such inbreeding.

Apparently these changes in the Honor System were contrived by
the EC before it officially took office, back in the spring of the 1972-73
session. The newly elected members met regularly in unpublicized ses-
sions to organize and plan for official action for this year, or so we
thought. But apparently, such was not the case.

And so, a number of students already this year have been found
guilty of honor violations by the EC and have withdrawn without public
trial. Who is to say whether this would have been the case if they had
nad a voice in the EC’s efforts to change the Honor System last spring?
We assume that justice has prevailed, and that the guilty students have
been ferreted out and the innocent have returned to the bosom of the
university.

But whatever the case, the entire student body, not just the EC,
should have been able to actively participate in the process of modify-
ing the Honor System. Through a referendum or through some kind of
vote, the students should have the say as to how an honor trial should
be run. Instead, we have had imposed upon us a new honor trial by the

EC, of the EC, and apparently for the EC.

EC letter explains changes
in bonor trial procedure

To the student body:

When you picked up your Win-
ter Term sehedules you were
given a new copy of the Honor
System “White Book.” You receiv-
ed the copy for two reasons:

1—The Executive Committee
made several important changes
in the public hearings procedure
and in the reading of a student’s
transcript should he have to leave
Washington and Lee due to an
honor violation. These changes
were made last spring and incor-
porated in freshmen orientation.

2—The Student Body Constitu-
tion requires that the Executive
Committee annually orient the
Student Body to the Honor Sys-
tem. In the past the EC has been
negligent in this respect. Though
this current “orientation” is not
the most satisfactory, we are
hopeful that it will refresh you
with the meaning and procedures
of the Honor System.

The exact changes occur first
on page nine of the “White Book”
in Sections N and P. Section N
outlines the difference in the
transcript report between convic-
tion and withdrawal following a

Ask Traveller

private hearing and withdrawal
following a public hearing. This
change was made to insure com-
plete confidentiality of the private
hearing.

Section P details the major
change in the public hearing pro-
cedure—that of a member of the
Executive Committee presenting
a written summary of the case
including the facts presented to
the EC as well as the reasoning
behind the EC decision.

The next change occurs on
Page 11 in Section A. Here the
President of the Student Bar As-
sociation replaces ‘the Student
Body President as Chairman of a
public hearing. The reasoning
here is that the EC President
might be biased in his rulings
and slant the public hearing due
to his having already heard the
private hearing.

The next change occurs on Page
15 where the procedure for pre-
senting the EC summary is out-
lined.

It was the intention of the
Executive Committee in making
these changes to strengthen the

Q—All year I’ve noticed that there are several dozen of the same girls
who never seem to leave school when the weekend's over. Whose

dates are they anyway?

A—Those aren’t dates, you goose! If they were, what would you do for
conversation after Tuesday and a fresh shirt on Wednesday?
These girls you see all the time are only co-eds and, as such, don't

have to be spoken to at all.
Q—But why are they here?

A—The old bugaboo about co-eds being after a man is pure myth.
Why, the ones I’ve happened to walk through town with don't
even slow down when we pass the wedding display in Waggy’s
front window. And only one co-ed has coyly cooed “hope chest’ to
me when the subject of soup spoons and matching pillow cases
came up in conversation. No, the “now” co-ed at W&L lives com-
pletely for her studies, burning with scholarly fever and thirsting
for higher knowledge. Some of them even carry books to class if
their purses don’t get in the way.

Unfortunately, since W&L is not officially coeducational, there
can technically be no co-eds as such. And since these girls aren't
dates either, a vague problem of nomenclature surrounds them.

Q—What do you suggest?

A—Simple. Declare them national landmarks. Then ask Leigh Chap-

pel out for a date...

In Lexington

What’s happening

By JOHN ZAMOISKI

Not that it costs a lot of money
to have a good time in Lexington
as it is, but there are those stu-
dents who are very tight on
money who are looking for inex-
pensive ways to have a good
time. A great deal of research
has revealed that Lexington of-
fers many entertainment oppor-
tunities that cost little or nothing.

A good friend has confided that
many people at the laundromat
take their clothes out of the dry-
er before the dime’s worth of
spins have been used up. The
watchful observer usually can
get four or five free rides a night.

Naturally, the big spenders can
always bring their own dime for
a full uninterrupted ride.

I heard some one talking about
going to the Drive-In the other
day. He’s got a new twist on tak-
ing a date there. His philosophy is
that no one goes to a Drive-In to
watch the movie, so why pay the
admission price to play around.

This student simply parks out-
side the gate and tells his date
that their speaker doesn’t work.
After a few minutes of trying to
guess what the actors are saying,
they get down to business. After
all, that’s the real reason they
went to the Drive-In anyway! The
nice thing is the only investment
is the gas.

Why not go down to the corner
of Main Street and Route 60 some
night and count the number of
times the traffic lights change
every hour. While you're there
vou can yell at the people who
aren't used to the new street sys-

Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy
Return to Forever, featuring
Chick Corea
Polydor PD 5536

While 1973 saw many of the
powerful forces in electric music
leveling off into comfortable,
commercially safe styles, there
was definitely new ground being
explored elsewhere.

The most innovative electric
album of 1973, barely making it
by the calendar, covers a good
bit of new ground. Hymn of the
Seventh Galaxy is the strongest
music using what is basically a
rock instrumentation and context
to come along yet, surpassing
even the Mahavishnu Orchestra.
There is more stylistic diversity
here; Corea is capable of instilling
a feeling of looseness into the
music, as well as the straight-
ahead kind of tightness McLaugh-
lin often locks his band into.

Like Santana’s Welcome, Hymn
embraces obvious sources. Corea

tem as they drive down Main
Street the wrong way. Take a
camera because the embarrassed
looks on the drivers’ faces once
they realize their mistakes are
worth a fortune.

Watch Ray Miller’s Antique
Store window. Periodically he'll
advertise an auction. Go in, bid
on everything, and then sneak out
when it comes time to pay up. It
makes for poetic justice because
Ray Miller always has ringers in
the audience bidding up the
prices.

Have you ever thought of sitt-
ing on the wall in front of the
courthouse on a Saturday night
and staring back at the people
who drive by as they stare at
you? It’s a real treat.

Why not go listen to Aurthur
Silver tell jokes for a few hours.
Or stop by Highs Ice Cream and
watch the girl behind the counter.

While you’re in the neighbor-
hood take a putter up to the mina-
ture golf course and play while
the place is closed. How come no
one ever goes over to VMI to
hassle the sentries any more? All
they ever say is, “Halt or Ill
Shoot!” Of course there aren’t any
bullets in the guns.

Finally there is one free activity
that stands high above the others;
a trip to Kenny’s Burger Palace.
Drive up there some night and
circle the place about ten times,
gunning the engine the entire
time. To increase the excitement,
borrow a 57 Chevy for the excur-
sion. I can’t even try to explain
the fun you'll have .... and it’s
all free!

, soaring

has chosen those sources well:
this music has the same pirit-
foree a Mahavishnu, the intellec-
tual strength of Weather Report’s
5gawinul, Shorter, or Vitous, and
arrangements as carefully sculp-
tured to the instrumentation as
Deodato’s.

Along with this, the music has
a feeling of freedom without the
sort of falling-apart looseness
which many jazz keyboard artists
are moving towards. Corea has al-
ready been through that, with
Circle. Their Paris Concert album
(ECM ST 1018/19) is some of the
best improvisational ensemble
music ever recorded,

Corea also comes through well
in a slightly more controlled im-
provising atmosphere; his work
with Miles Davis, particularly
Miles Davis at Fillmore (Colum-
bia G80038), shows this well.

Corea can also improvise quite
well by himself, as on his two
volumes of piano improvisations
(ECM ST 1014, 1020). With Hymn

By ROME SCOTT

Sitting here, crunched over by
too many “Merry Christmases”
and the saccahrine embraces that
always seem to go with the sea-
son of booze, I’ll tell you sincere-
ly—I’m up to no good.

And the bad is so bad it’s no
good either.

Youre probably wondering
what I’m talking about so I'll tell
you—television has discovered a
new way to insult the viewer.

You, of course, are dying to
know what that technique is
when television, with its idiot
level commercials and unfunny
situation tragedies such as the
Mary Tyler Moore Show, has tax-
ed your endurance to the nth
degree.

Well, “dear reader,” the ‘edited
for television’ movies have gone
farther than merely cutting out
the hand-holding scenes and the
passonite lip brushes that even
puritans would yawn over—now
they blank out offensive words,
you know the ones I mean,
“damn,” “hell,” and the like.

The average viewer is used to
the “bleep” syndrome of the talk
shows and some of the game
shows where Johnny Carson’s
guest says, “So I kicked the son
of a bleep in the bleep,” or a
newly wed blurts out that his
favorite part of his wife’s body is
her bleep.

That, the viewer can take. I
mean he wouldn’t want poor, old
Johnny to be sued for a guest’s
off-color remark. Not only that
but it’s amusing to see a guests’s

mouth say “damn” and_ hear
“bleep.”
Now, though, television has

Inside-Out

ean

gone too far. To be watching a
feature length movie and see an
argument between the main char-
acter and his wife in which the
man says, ‘What do you mean
I’m a (here the sound goes dead
and you see the man’s mouth say
bastard),” is more than the view-
er should have to endure.

Anybody in the audience offend-
ed by the word “bastard” raise
your hand.

Ah, but everyone knows that if
you give those television people
an inch they’ll take a mile. If
“bastard” were allowed now, next
would be “bitch” (women’s lib
you know) and then where would
we be?

The movie which set off this
rampage is “Number One” shown
on WSLS channel 10, in Roanoke
on Jan. 5.

A story about an aging quarter-
back who doesn’t want to admit
he’s over the hill, the last few
minutes of the movie exemplify
the new technique.

Picture a football game in the
Sugar Bow! with the quarterback
hero in a huddle calling the next
play. “Left red, slant x, 54 green
on 10. Let’s knock them on their
(no sound, even the crowd sounds
are gone),” the hero says.

How much intelligence does it
take to figure out that the man
said, “Let’s knock them on their
asses.”

‘Now the movies, tomorrow the
news.

I can see it coming—We’re in
for some (no sound) weather—we
can’t have “foul” words in our
weather forecasts.

What would the children think

(Continued on page 8)

but relaxed Hymn

of the Seventh Galaxy, he can add
to his already cosmopolitan bag
the high-energy, rock-oriented
genre,

Corea’s uniqueness lies in his
versatility as a writer. Besides
his abilities as a player, Corea
has also mastered composition.
Each piece has a definite theme,
but the themes emphasize them-
selves more by intensity than by
repitition.

The music doesn’t border on
neurosis or threaten to become
boring; the changes happen when
they should, The transitions are
seldom sweet, though; Corea finds
as much beauty in contrast as in
lyrical prettiness.

The other members of the band
come off well, too. Stanley Clarke
is one of the few bassists who
has acquired equally proficient
abilities on the acoustic and elec-
tric bass.

Bill Connor’s guitar playing has
definite traces of John McLaugh-
lin, but on the whole he comes

 

across much looser than Mahavish-
nu. Connors is able to take his
time in getting it on with the
fretboard and not let things drag.
He is one of the few players to
use more than one consistent
timbre on electric guitar.

As a drummer, Lenny White
tends toward rock, but is the first
drummer since Mickey Hart to
have a sense of silent space as an
important element of rhythm.
The album begins with its short-
est band, the title cut. No one
really opens up on this one; it
serves mostly as a prelude of
things to come.

It is followed by bassist Clarke's
piece, “After the Cosmic Rain,”
the only non-Corea composition
on the album. Clarke shows him-
self to be on an equal par with
Corea in writing and arranging,
While Corea takes on an almost
totally supportive role wiht equ-
ally full abilities.

W&L offers

special course

° e e
in reading skill

As a new service to Washing-
ton and Lee students, the Univer-
sity has engaged Baldridge Read-
ing and Study Skills, Ine. to offer
m campus this term a special
new program designed to improve
reading and learning skills in
icademic subjects.

The program is not merely a
speed-reading course. Its techni-
jues are designed to increase
reading speed, to strengthen com-
prehension, to improve recall, to
sustain concentration and _ to
leepen analysis. A student uses
1is own classroom reading mater-
ials rather than mass-prepared
instructional literature and mech-
anical training aids.

This program will be conducted
m the Washington and Lee cam-
pus by an instructor from Bald-
ridge Reading from January 23
through February 22. Scheduling
Vill be flexible to accommodate
individual student schedules, and
classes will be small to permit
qecessary individual attention.
Each student will attend a total
if twenty sessions, five per week.
Tuition for the program will be
$95, payable by the start of the
program upon receipt of a state-
ment from Baldridge.

Further information and regi-
stration cards may be obtained
from the Office of the Dean of
Students, Washington Hall 25,

The resolution calls for a spec-
in which the Univer-

mittee to examine the medical
situation. Many members. stated
that several unfortunate situa-
tions have been caused by the in-
firmary’s inadequacy. The resolu-
tion was apparently prompted by
rumors following the death last
term of freshman John Stanford
Mever.

Student Body President Doug
Schwartz announced a Tuesday,

January 8, discussion at 7:30
about the Fine Arts problem.
Participants included the Fine

Arts faculty, several Fine Arts

Speculation seems less shrill
this year than last, possibly be-
cause the local favorites, George
Allen’s gimpy Redskins, have
been relegated to the same obser-
vation role as the rest of us, or
possibly because the Dolphins ap-
pear suspiciously similar, in style
and success, to those drama-
squelching Packers of the not-so-
distant past.

Certainly, Miami presents an
awesome case as favorite for
super-bowl riches. This is their
third consecutive appearance in
the affair, and they have never
entered a sounder football team.
Admittedly, conservatism charac-
terizes their offensive attack, but
the tedium of Csonka’s bullish
plowing or Morris’ skittish end
sweeps can not be too loudly cri-
ticized when such tactics trans-
late into victories.

Particularly convincing was the
Dolphins’ obliteration of a _ for-
midable Oakland Raider team on
December 30, a 27-10 rout that re-
quired only six Bob Griese passes.
Miami led from start to finish,
and controlled the ball in a fash-
ion that kept the Raiders’ Kenny
Stabler from ever generating the
offensive explosions of which he
is so capable.

Enter Minnesota. The Vikings
clobbered Dallas because they
played with emotion and imagina-
tion, and because Coach Grant al-

lowed Tarkington to draw freely
from his bag of flamboyant tricks.
The magic show must surely con-
tinue if the North-Landers are to
deny the Dolphins of their seem:
ing destiny, for Minnesota’s over-
all strength can not match the
AFC champ’s blend of offensive
fire-power and defensive muscle.

The once celebrated Purple
Gang is now an aging group, sus-
ceptible to the run. However, it
is also a group motivated by an
embarrassing memory, the 23-
debacle suffered at the hands of
Kansas City four years ago.

In subduing both Washington
and Dallas, the Vikings came up
with big plays: the bomb to Gil-
liam, the interception by Bryant.
The Dolphins have been remark-
ably free of such miscues, It is
said that a truly great team makes
its breaks. Quite literally, then,
Minnesota’s task will be just such
a test of greatness.

In essence, the game pits the
last of the big-play artists (where
now are Unitas, Brodie, and
crumbling Jurgenson?) against a
veritable machine of consistency.
My good sense suggests a ho-hum
Dolphin victory, perhaps (oh no!)
a repeat of last year’s epic dissec-
tion of Washington. My hopes, in
ready contrast, lie with the
Scrambler, the individual who
defies predictability—for better
or for worse.

Basketball squad captures third

in tourney with consolation win

By BILL AUSTIN

As the only winless guest at
Washington and Lee University’s
fifth Invitational Basketball Tour-
nament, St. Paul’s College proved
rudely un-cooperative.

Sporting a none-too-impressive
0-6 won-lost mark, the Tigers pro-
ceeded to upend W&L by 78-75
this past Friday night, then com-
pleted their successful stay with
a 93-83 triumph over stubborn St.
Mary’s College of Maryland in
Saturday’s finale.

Meanwhile, the Generals garn-
ered third place honors with a
93-63 pasting of Susquehanna Uni-
versity, a team which fell to St.
Mary’s and Walter Clark’s last
second 15-footer, 69-67, in Friday’s
Opener.

To be sure, W&L’s opening
round confrontation with the tall,
hungry St. Paul’s team generated
the fiercest battle of the four-
game tourney. The Generals were
themselves anxious for a victory,
having suffered a pair of spirit-
sapping defeats at the hands of
Lynchburg College and Baltimore
University prior to the Christmas
break.

In St. Paul’s, the squad en-
countered an opponent quite simi-
lar, in size and style, to Baltimore
U's bunch, and the game exhibit-
ed a disturbing parallel concern-
ing the Generals’ inability to fol-
low up missed shots with second
chances.

In contrast, St. Paul’s managed
as many as four or five shots at a
time, nullifving W&L’s shooting
edge (46.7% to the Tigers’ 42.9%)
bv grabbing 50 rebounds to the
Generals’ 42.

Donnie Roberts, St. Paul’s 6’7”
center and the tournament’s even-
tual Most Valuable Player, topp-
ed his squad’s tough board work
with 15 rebounds, while team-
mates Williams and Byrd pulled
down 11 and 10 apiece.

Nevertheless, W&L neutralized
the Tiger board-power through-
out, behind the excellent outside
shooting of Bow Williams. Bomb-
ing over the top of St. Paul’s zone,
Williams hit on 10 of 14 attempts,
many of them from 18 to 25 feet
out. His 23 points topped all Gen-
eral scorers.

Indeed, it was William’s early
burst which sparked W&L to a
6-2 lead, a bulge which was not to
be matched again. With Roberts
at work, St. Paul’s bounced back,
taking a 20-12 lead half-way into
the opening period.

At that point, the Tigers made
wholesale changes in their line-
up, and followed this with a brief
stab at a man-to-man defense.
Both moves appeared to backfire.
The Generals quickly closed the
gap, and the lead sea-sawed to
the half’s end, with W&L atop by
one, at 40-39.

In the final stanza, the Generals
saw a 48-45 margin disappear, and
then engaged in a scrap which
tied 10 times in the final 15 min-
utes of play. St. Paul’s Alleyne
Byrd enjoyed a hot hand, totall-
ing 18 points on his medium-
range jump shots which well com-
plemented the inside scoring of
Roberts (21 points).

For W&L, Norm Kristoff pro-
vided considerable second-half
firepower, consistently hitting his
turn-around jumper from inside
the foul line. In all, he converted
eight of nine field goal attempts.

With the game tied at 70, the
Generals suffered through a dis-
astrous 2:45 period of point-scar-
city. Costly turnovers, coupled
with St. Paul’s foul-line successes
in the one-and-one situation, put

the home team down by 5, at 77-
72, with only 13 seconds remain-
ing.

However, after canning one of
two free throw attempts, Williams
lofted a harassed 30-foot shot
which somehow fell through, and
the Generals, still game, called a
time-out.

On the St. Paul’s inbounds pass,
Skip Lichtfuss purposely fouled
Tommie Williams, who jubilantly
made one of his two chances, in-
suring the Tiger edge. The ending
typified the frustration experienc-
ed by W&L’s senior captain, on a
night when many of his 25 at-
tempted shots came Close, but
would not fall. He made but nine.

The mark of a fine ball player
can be determined by his ability
to regroup his skills after having

a trying, difficult game. Licht-
fuss’ solid effort in Saturday

.aght’s match-up of Friday’s #s-
ers was such a showing. Indeed,
his strong shooting (10 for 18),
rebounding (10) and hustle char-
acterized a strong team perform-
ance, as twelve players figured in
the season-high scoring of 93
points.

Admittedly, Susquehanna U. did
not possess the natural ability of

a St. Pawl’s. Outside of Dave
Long, a mobile 6’6” sophomore
center, the team held no danger-

ous scoring threat. His 16 first-
half points kept Susquehanna
close for most of the opening per-
iod, though the contest was last
tied at 8-all. A balanced front-line
attack put the Generals in front
by 10 at the half, paced by Licht-
fuss’ 12, Williams’ eight, and Kris-
toff’s seven points.
Out-rebounded

the previous

night, W&L had little difficu:t
in dominating the aehattie
against youthful Susquehanna.
Kristoff led the way with 13 re-
bounds. The team blew the com-
petative lid off things by scoring
10 points to Susquehanna’s 2 at
the outset of the final stanza.

Thus able to substitute freely,
Coach Canfield placed five sopho-
mores in the game. Indicative of
the potential and depth of this
year’s squad, a 63-49 lead then
swelled to 74-51.

Guards Maloney and Rice press-
ed opposing ball-handlers into
numerous mistakes, while shreda-
ing the Susquehanna press with
ease. In turn, Baum, Kristoff, and
Fitzgerald contributed a flurry of
baskets, and the rout was on. The
final tally of 93-63 put an em-
phatic end to the agonies of a
four-game tail-spin.

In addition to Lichtfuss’ team
leading 21 points, Williams con-
tributed 17, Kristoff 16.

Following St. Paul’s win in the
championship game, an effort pac-
ed by Tommie Roberts’ 30 points,
the All-Tourney team was an-
nounced. Those chosen included
Bow Williams, Dave Long of Sus-
quehanna, Walter Clark of St.
Mary’s, along with Alleyne Byrd
and Donnie Roberts of St. Paul's.

The Generals, holding a 2-4 rec
ord, met Bridgewater Tuesday
night. The team returns to Dore-
mus gym tonight for an 8 p.™
meeting with Wilmington.

Senor Mouse,” a carefree, roam-
ing sort of powerhouse which
sticks closer to its theme than
any of the other songs. The
changes are successful wander:
ings through many possibilities,
returning to the theme almost as
comic relief at points.

Side 2 is even more immediate.
The forceful swing of “Theme to
the Mothership” gives it an air of
triumph and great joy. Next is the
2-part “Space Circus;” part 1 is
Corea tracking himself.

His haunting, almost Gothic
melodies on electric piano and
harpsichord, solidly supported
with some well-placed organ
chords, drift almost to silence be-
fore the transition to part 2, some
loud but very righteous electric
music.

Besides high spiritual energy
there is a bit of funkiness in the
music, a sort of smiling get-to-it-
iveness. Closing out the album is
“The Game Maker,” another
pounding, soaring and yet also
relaxing piece.

This is state-of-the-art electric
music, Return to Forever is an
excelent example of what can be
done within a basic rock context
when done by true artists. The
album’s one drawback is a fairly
extensive use of tracking.

This music couldn’t be the same
in concert, but with Corea and
this band it would definitely be
worth listening to anyway.
