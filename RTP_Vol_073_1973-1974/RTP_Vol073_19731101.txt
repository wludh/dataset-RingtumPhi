discuss private matters. The EC
approved in unanimously and en-

proposal with their teachers, The
proposal goes up before the Uni-
versity Council Thursday.

Freshmen interested in serving
on student committees should
place an application in the EC
Box by 6:30 Monday night. Posi-
tions will be filled on the Cold
Check, Curriculum, Mock Con-
vention, and Recruitment Com-
mittees. Interviews for the Cur-
riculum Committee are scheduled
for Monday at 8 and for the
other committees Tuesday at 6:30.

Student Body President Doug

Schwartz reported on the October
Board of Trustees meeting, which
he attended as an ex officio mem-
ber. He announced that a plan for
Fine Arts development will be
submitted by the EC at the

Trustees January meeting.

Law School rep Tom King
complained about the informality
of mock election procedures. He
pointed out that candidates use
W&L results in their campaigns,
and consequently all steps should
be taken to ensure fair elections.
The EC urged that all elections
have due notice and a large voter
turnout.

After some discussion the EC
voted that all student office
candidates, write-in and official,
must comply with financial and
poster regulations. It also recom-
mended

that magazines once

again be sold in the Co-op,
Newly elected freshman rep
Scott Franklin suggested that

upperclassmen be reindoctrinated
about the Honor System. The pro-
cedure for doing this is under
consideration.

Sophomore Rowe Williams was
appointed co-chairman of the film
committee.

Next week:

—Freshman application for
committees due Monday at 6:30;

—Interviews held Monday at

About 1,200 parents are expect-
ed this Friday and Saturday for
Washington and Lee University’s
annual Parents’ Weekend.

Principal events of the week-
end include the traditional “re-
port to parents” Saturday in Lee
Chapel by university President
Robert E. R. Huntley and Douglas

dent body. Presiding at the 11
a.m. session will be Dr. Lewis
John, dean of students.

A football game at 1:30 p.m.
on Wilson Field will be another
highlight for the parents, as

Washington and Lee’s Generals
seek to rebound from four

straight losses as they face South-
western of Memphis in the two
teams’ 15th vearly clash. South-
western’s Lynx hold the edge in

the series, seven to six, with one
tie.

The formal program of the
weekend begins Friday at 8:15
with a three-part musical pre
gram in Lee Chapel, to which
members ef the public as well
as parents and other

The right to know...

At tonight’s University Council meeting, senior Ted Amshoff
is scheduled to introduce a proposal asking for the council’s recom-
mendation that faculty meetings be made open to the public.

The faculty, by the way, meets monthly and will be meeting
Monday at 4:30 p.m. in the New Science building.

The question of open faculty meetings was raised on this campus
last year, and the question was answered at that time by the faculty
in one word—no. The faculty raised several arguments through the
student-faculty University Council, including:

—The meetings are boring, and no student would really want to
attend them anyway;

—Opening the meetings would inhibit the use of the UC as a
faculty-student forum;

—Faculty members would feel inhibited in their voting by the
presence of students;

—The student media would not cover the meeting objectively;

—And matters involving individual students are sometimes dis-
cussed during the meetings.

The first argument doesn’t deserve mention as even a partially
valid argument.

We feel the UC wouldn’t be inhibited by the move. The opening
of faculty meetings would not necessarily mean letting the students
take an active role in discussions, A situation similar to one of specta-
tors in a courtroom could be arranged.

We think that faculty members by this time, for the most part,
are quite mature enough to make decisions for themselves without
being inhibited by students.

As far as the student media reporting objectively, we feel that
they could report at least as objectively as any faculty or administra-
tion member could do so. Our bias is no more biased than your bias,
so to speak. And with reports of the meetings in the student news-
paper or over the air as broadcast by WLUR, at least the meetings
would be reported. Most students don’t even know that the faculty
even meets, let alone that it is the primary body in making academic
decisions—i.e., all course, curriculum, and degree decisions—which
effect each and every Washington and Lee student in many cases.

As far as discussion of individual matters goes, we suggest a
simple solution—close the meetings by executive session as far as
discussion of individual students is concerned. As is the case with
the student body Executive Committee, we as a part of the media do
not want to concern ourselves with cases involving individual stu-
dents; we only want the facts—and all the facts—on matters con-
cerning the student body at large.

We only want our right to konw.

—P.J.L.

...and the right to be heard

Speaking of the faculty, a second proposal affecting students—
concerning the Courses and Degrees Committee—is expected to be
brought before the professors at their Monday get-together... for
the second time, unless it is tabled.

Earlier this year, the faculty defeated a proposal 46-40, which
would have increased student representation on the C&D Committee
from one to four.

Indications at that meeting (although we cannot be sure since
the meeting was closed) were that the faculty rejected the proposal
because there was no substantive argument backing the proposal.

From what we have heard, arguments for the proposal were kept
brief by its proponents because there seemed to be no doubt that
the proposal would be passed without difficulty. The proposal was
simply too good not to approve, the proponents reasoned. They were
wrong.

And now, the backers of the proposal have regrouped and are
ready to try again, this time armed with the arguments needed to
push the proposal through and with the experience not to trust any
seeming complacency of the faculty to appear to go along with the
proposal.

We hope this time that the faculty passes the measure. Increas-
ing student membership on the C&D Committee would do nothing
to affront faculty power—certainly the faculty recognizes this.

As it stands now, the faculty, meeting as a group, is the only
body on this campus with any power to initiate academic change.
C&D is merely a committee of recommendation. Any decision which
it passes must be given a stamp of approval by the faculty. The
students will have no more power than they had before; they will
only have a better chance for their wants and needs to be heard
py the faculty in hopes that necessary changes will be made.

That is not power; it is a right—the right to be heard.

A word of advice for Nov. 6

Vote.

3 TQ THE EL

Republicans clarify
stand on Nixon, tapes
Dear Sir:

I would like to clear up some
confusion about last week’s cov-
erage of a resolution of the
Executive Board of the Washing-
ton and Lee Republicans.

First, this resolution did not
call for the disassociation of Presi-
dent Nixon from the Republican
Party. It called for the party to
reexamine—not abandon—it un-
critical support of the President.

Second, the resolution is an
action of the Executive Board,
not the W&L Republicans as a
whole. The Executive Board con-
sists of all elected officers of the
Club, plus the chairman of the
various operational committees.

This body has always enjoyed
the full confidence of the club
membership, and it is the efforts
of these members that have made
the W&L Republicans the best
College Republican Club in the
nation.

Still, they do not speak for the
whole club membership, and I

 

feel this should be made more
explicit.

Finally, as the resolution speaks
of possible obstruction of justice
in its reasons for supporting the
re-examination, I feel that the
President’s action of Oct. 28, in
releasing the tapes to Judge
Sirica, is sufficient to satisfy the
resolution.

Sincerely,

Carlyle Gregory

President, W&L Republicans

Editor’s note: We regret the
misinterpretation as a “usually
reliable source” proved wrong.

However, we still disagree with
your final paragraph.

Ask Traveler

Q—Is it worthwhile to get to know your teachers ouside of class?

A—My first impulse would be to say ‘certainly,’ even professors get
tired of maintaining their professional stoicism when they’d much
rather be quoting Popular Mechanics to drooling townspeople
like the rest of us! However, as the return address on your letter
is McCormick Annex, I suspect your simple question smaks of
brown-nosing, grade-grubbing, bootlicking and all the other traits

of the dedicated apple-polisher .. .

Q—So answer my question; does playing up to a teacher help one’s
GPR?

A—The answer’s ‘yes’! Teacher’s are human and love attention, no
matter if it comes in the form of blackboard washing after class
or gourmet recipes that you kopped out of the The Ladies Home
Journal, Why, I’ve known students going into finals with granite
F’s emerge smelling of ‘dean’s list’ just by doing the right thing,
like buying the prof that tweed sports coat with the leather
elbows that he’d been secretly coveting since his undergraduate
days at Sewanee. It’s just a matter of knowing the man’s weak-
nesses. Sometimes a simple “great class, sir” after a particularly
boring seminar will swing the old goat over to your side of the
gradebook. Whatever you do, though, stay away from asking the
traditionally stupid questions in class, because, more often than
not, those are exactly the questions the prof can’t answer! Re-
member, college professors deal in esoteria not World Books.

Q—What sort of question do you recommend?

A—Something straightforward, like “got change for a fifty, sir?”

Thursday, November 1, 1973

By ROME SCOTT

Sitting inside on one of the
newly arrived, dismal days of
winter’s onslaught, I began dig-
sing through the stack of albums
that has accumulated over the
vears and came up with one of
the undoubtedly least publicized
records to be put out recently.

‘Ashes are Burning” by Renais-
sance, a British group, was given
to me by the female vocalist of
the band last summer when I!
was reviewing a Wishbone Ash
COnCEert.

When I came across her album
I decided it was about time some-
body talked about Annie Haslam,
and the music on the album.

The story behind how I got
the album and met the girl is
interesting if not important to
understanding the situation well
enough to appreciate the record’s
undeserved lack of acclaim.

Upstairs, in the stands, the
crowd was clapping and the
music pulsating so that only bare
remnants of reached the
dressing room.

I had gone to the dressing room
for an interview with the man-
ager of Wishbone Ash, Miles
Copeland, but he was nowhere
around.

I had been told by the group’s

bass

Inside-Out

  

agency in New York to get a hold
of Haslam if Copeland was busy
and that’s how I ended up with
oS

P started to ask her -ap0ut
Wishbone but after the first few
questions she said that I would
have to talk to Copeland, that she
was in America to promote her
group’s new album.

“Great,” I thought. “Just what
I need.” As I started to get up
and make my way to the door,
she asked me to stay and started
i 6:5 fou fee eet
wasn’t at all interested but for
the sake of being polite I sat
still and listened to the barrage
of promotion talk.

My attitude at this point is
what I meant by the lack of
enthusiasm shown by the public
toward the album.

As I sat in the semi-darkness of
the cavernous room, I took notes
to pass the time and, at least
in part, to humor the girl.

When the unplanned interview
ended she handed me the album
and I gladly left.

I didn’t realize what I’d nearly
passed up until I got home and
plaved the album,

dark mood inclinations.

Haslam had said the group’s
music could be called classical
rock which sounded snobbish

when she said it but turned out
to be a fairly precise label for
tenaissance’s music.

The pure classical was lost
somewhere in making the album
but the feeling was there. An
accurate assessment of the mode
of the music is that the intention
grew from classical but resulted
in a mutated form when the lyrics
were added.

The classical influence is most
apparent in the structure of the
music. The use of harpsichord,
celeste, strings and horns add a
pristine delicacy that is inherent
in chamber music.

The lyrics are integrated with
the music to create visual images
of situation rather than to appeal
to the intellect.

doe sie and tie iyries are
fluid but dynamic. The drive be-
hind the structure is the quality
that gives the music its own
category, differentiating it from
classical,

The record improves with close
scrutiny and stands witness to
the reasoning behind the group’s
name. The approach to the music
on Renaissance’s album is fresh,
alive, a real rebirth of the feel-
ing found in the music that has
lasted.

The record proved my initial

Tower of Power,
Freedie King concert

The Tower of Power, Freddie
King and Sylvester and his Hot
3and concert is Nov. 9 at 8 p.m
in Doremus Gym.

Tower of Power, an ii-man
group from Oakland, Calif., puts
on a show of rocking rhythm and
blues. The band features a horn
section that the San Francisco
Chronicle called the “tightest
horn section in existence.” It is
meshed with vocals and a rhythm
section in a combination that
guarantees kick.

Freddie King follows the tradi-
tion of greatness set by the other
Kings, B.B. and Albert, laying
down some of the finest blues
to be found.

The hard-hitting guitarist from
Gilmer, Texas has recorded with
Muddy Waters, Sonny Cooper, T-
Bone Walker and others as well
having his latest album produced.
by Leon Russell.

King, Tower of Power and
Sylvester add up to a concert not
to be missed.

Though quite brief, “The Fox,”

and humor with timeless insights

“The Diary” was originally the
first act of the successful Broad-
way show, “The Apple Tree,” a
1966 musical that offered three
short plays in a very loose frame-
work, each being the result of a
short-story adaptation. However,
“The Diary” fared particularly
well with critics and viewers, pos-
sibly because of its derivation
from the fertile genius of Mark
Twain.

Jerry Bock and Sheldon Har-
nick, the pair who wrote the

musie and lyrics for “Fiddler on
the Roof,” conceived the idea for
such a_ prose-to-musical tranla-
tion. A 13-month New York run-
ning evidenced the wisdom of
their attempt.

The Alpha-Omega Players of
Dallas, Texas have subsequently
taken the show through five years
of touring, staging more than
2700 performances in 45 states
and Canada. “The Diary’s” longe-
vity apparently stems from the
unique fashion in which the
green-world of Eden is recreated
and fueled with comic complexi-
ties. Adam emerges as a simple,

good-natured creature, easy prey
for the barbed-wire tongue of his
rib-coneocted mate, Eve. Into the
midst of this domestic mismatch
prances the serpent, a slick so-
phisticate attired in a dinner
jacket, and the uneasy Paradise
is destined for a tumble. Surely
this is the stuff upon which satire
feasts.

The show comes to campus
through the efforts of the Uni-
versity Culture Committee. Tick-
ets are available in advance of
the performance for $.75, while

“Royal Hunt of the Sun’—a review

Pomp and power on a tiny stage

By TED BLAIN

To pack the majesty of the
ancient Incan empire onto the
tiny stage of the W&L Theatre
takes, in itself, remarkable ambi-
tion. Student director Doug
Thomas, with “The Royal Hunt
of the Sun,” does not merely
succeed in fitting Peru onto the
stage; he renders a grand nation’s
downfall with all the pomp and
power it deserves. Directing as
a drama major his senior thesis
production, Thomas rates an A
plus for his efforts. He overcomes
the miniature stage with minia-
ture spectacle, and despite cer-
tain shortcomings in the last half
of the play, he brings to the
University Theatre a bona fide
success.

Francisco Pizarro’s emascula-
tion of the Incas in 1532 has been
taught to every student since
grade school. With less than 175
men Pizarro and his lieutenant
Hernando de Soto captured chief-
tain, Atahuallpa and held him
for an impossible ransom—a room
full of gold. The ransom paid,
Pizarro killed Atahuallpa, leaving
the Incas broken and poor.

Playwright Peter Shaffer
(whose brother Anthony wrote
“Sleuth”’) presents Pizarro and
Atahuallpa as mighty opposites,
drawn to one another like poles
of a magnet, each simultaneously
the hunter and the game. Both
men claim illegitimate births, but
where Pizarro is suckling of a
sow, Atahuallpa is son of the sun,
a god on earth. Pizarro is a fad-

ing conquistador hunting for im-
mortality through fame; Atahu-
allpa is a young god, seeking the
blessing of the white divinity,
Pizarro. Face to face in antagon-
ism at the beginning of the play,
the two are side by side, literally
tied together at the end. They
find laughter, respect, love in one
another, but these brief pleasures
give way to a more lasting de-
spair.

Shaffer said of the play that
he was portraying “two immense
and joyless powers.” Joyless in-
deed is the world of his work.
Pizarro speaks often of birds of
prey, for he is obsessed by the
tendency of one species to attack
another. Shaffer shows man as a
bird of prey: Christian opposes
pagan; Spaniard opposes Inca; red
soldier opposes brown soldier,
without thought of their similar
heritage, humanity. Any slight
voices of hope and chivalry soon
vanish into vomit in the: gutter.
Nothing can last; even the great
sun becomes a piece of booty to
gamble over. As the sun fades,
so does the Inca civilization.
Atahuallpa submits to death will-
ingly, confident that his father
in the sky will resurrect him. In
the end he is a cold heap on the
stage, an outrageous cheat to
Pizarro, who believed for a mo-
ment that man could conquer
death.

to a Thersites than a Pizarro, but
he submerges himself so well in
this role that his Pizarro is cred-
ible. In one of the best scenes of
the production, when Pizarro and
his men are marching into the
Inca empire, tramping and shift-
ing so well that the stage seems
for a moment the size of a foot-
ball field, Daughtrey’s hauteur
and confidence and grizzly ap-
pearance make him seem born
into the role.

Daughtrey’s haggard appear-
ance finds a perfect complement
in Jack Arnold’s’ Atahuallpa.
Where Daughtrey’s Pizarro is
clumsy and rough, Arnold’s Inca
chief is graceful, lithe, power-
fully restrained. His voice has the
properly arrogant timbre, his
bearing the perfect blend of reg-
ality and control. He is especially
effective in the first act as he
stands, in the large sunburst that
dominates the stage, monitoring
the approach of the Spaniards.

One other actor deserves spec-
ial mention—David Minton as
Martin Ruiz, the narrator, Minton
provides simply one of the solid-
est performances given in the
past four vears at the University

Theatre. He conveys so much
agony, so much beauty, so much
love and despair in his recital

that he is the one consitently

The faults that hinder the other
actors — exaggeration of gesture,
slip of accent—never appear in
Minton.

The remainder of the cast is
more than adequate. Brock John-
son renders a nearly flawless de
Soto, the noble foil to Pizarro.
Mark Bold appropriately oils his
way through the part of an insidi-
ous government tagalong. Don
Hogle creates an Indian transla-
tor that is just what he should
be—a destestable wimp. Rich
Krohn as de Candia is the best
of the soldiers, a lot occasionally
marred by an unfortunate South-
ern accent. Will Cantler, pouting
his way through the role of young
Martin Ruiz, seems unlikely to
grow into the wise old man of
David Minton. The priests, Alex
Bourdez and Paul Richards, mix
piety and hyprocrisy to the
proper proportions.

“ven with such generally fine
performances, the play has some
flaws, nearly all in the second
half. Where the hunt of Atahu-
allpa moves steadily and properly
to a well-timed climax, the Inca’s
execution hardly progresses at
all. Of course delay and impati-
ence are written into the play,
but they are sustained by mount-
ing tension. Pizarro’s captive has

&L looks to end losing skein
after loss to Sewanee Tigers, 31-0

By BILL FLESHER

Though the statistics and the
score wouldn’t indicate it, Wash-
ington and Lee’s defensive unit
played one of their better games
against Sewanee last Saturday.

True, the Purple Tigers did post
31 points on the scoreboard while
the Generals failed to cross the
goal line; and true as well Sewa-
nee did gain 385 yards on the day.

But the defense did well to

keep the totals that low. And,
actually, the score should have
been only 18-0.

More on that later.

The offense had their worst
day of the season, as they were
shutout for the first time this
season. W&L could muster only

148 yards total offense, and they
lost the ball an astounding eight
times on trunovers, with six of
those giveaways coming in the
first half.

The Tigers jumped out to a
6-0 lead late in the first quarter
when, after a W&L fumble, Gor-
do Watson went over from one
yard out.

They upped that lead to 12-0
at halftime when after another

However the officials, seeing

The average

No man who has mastered the flying skills
it takes to fly and land ona ship at sea can be

eaHed an average pilot. And the sense of
accomplishments and satisfaction that he

enjoys are also above average. Which is only

right. For the man who would go places as a
Naval Aviator must pass through the most

challenging and demanding training program

to be found anywhere.

From Aviation Officer Candidate School
through Flight Training to the day his

golden Navy Wings are awarded, he is tested;
driven; pushed and tested again. And for good

reason. The Navy has learned that without

the will to succeed, no man can be successful.

Navy Pilot isn’t.

The benefits aren't average either.

A Naval Aviator can earn up to $10,000 upon
commissioning, The pay after two years is
up to $12,000 and over $16,000 two years later.

Do you have what it takes to qualify to

fly NAVY? Even if you’ve never flown
before, if you've got the desire, you’re
halfway there.

The Navy Officer information team will
be on campus to discuss the professional
opportunities in NAVAL AVIATION and
NUCLEAR POWER training.

Stop by STUDENT SNACK BAR between
9 am, and 4 p.m, on the 7th, 8th and 9th

filled his room with gold, and
now Pizarro is frantic, standing
between potential mutiny on one
hand and the breaking of his
own word on the other. In this
production, the tension has occa-
sion to give way to tedium, as

Pizarro dawdles over a wood
carving while his men _ bicker.

The emphasis is wrong; one feels
that Pizarro is stubborn, not
conscience-stricken.

The most. distressing error
comes at the conclusion, when the
rising of the sun, so vital for

stage brighten somewhat, but

there is no sense of the awe that
should accompany dawn. Atahu-
allpa is, after all, son of the
sun, and to play down light in
favor of voices is unfair and con-
fusing. It is even more unfortu-
nate that such a lapse should
occur in a production that uses
music and light so well.

The play runs through Satur-
day, and if five days are time
enough for the rare flaws to dis-
appear, the final performance
should be impeccable—and sober-
ing—entertainment.
