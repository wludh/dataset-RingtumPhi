By now, you have already
wielded the most coveted
leverage of the W&L student:
The Fancy Dress Bid. And now
it is time to find out what just
rewards you and your highly
selected date shall reap from
the Student Activity Board's
80th Fancy Dress Ball presenta-
tion. Slap on Your Banana
Republic cumberbund and get
ready for the African jungle ex-
perience of “The Dark Conti-
nent”’ in the Warner Center and
Doremus Gymasium on March
6.

Glenn Smith, Fancy Dress
director of the SAB, anticipates
the flamboyant creation of a
jungle-like atmosphere com-
plete with the exotic mysticism
associated with Africa. Thi
torches will light the garden
walkway to the entrance which
will have the usual red carpet
along with a lit sign in the shape
of the African Continent. At the
doorway, guests will be met by
a trick performing elephant
while just inside the entrance,
on the right, is the cite for an
elaborate bamboo hut.

The entrance hallway itself
will be adorned with an over-
abundance of verdure: ivy,
ferns, bamboo, palm leaves;
and the trophy cases will be fill-
ed with African masques and
other simian artifacts.

You better hold on tight to
your Meryl Streep’s hand when
you enter the “Out of Africa”’
Warner Center. Here, in which
the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra
will alternate sets with the Steel
Drum Band, is the site for
SAB’s seventy man made
banana trees, which have real
banana leaves imported
straight from Africa. A jungle

jungle mural will top the
bleachers of the gym with
shogun-type bamboo huts lin-
ing its bottom.

The orchestra will be placed
in front of a swarthy back-
ground, and two other bamboo
huts will be put on its right and
left

To add to the jungle effect,
there will be green and blue
theatrical lights hung from the
ceiling which will illuminate an
occult haze produced by a
smoke machine in the rafters.

On the balcony of the Warner
Center, and only here, the SAB
will be serving Michelob and
Michelob Light to wrist band
wearers; the wrist bands,
which only will be given to those
of age, will be given at the ticket
sales. Beer can be taken down
off the balcony into the or-
chestra area, but no beer, ac-
cording to Smith, can be taken
out of the Warner Center.

The crowd, of course, will be
packed into the Doremus Gym
which will continue with the
SAB’s bushy theme with three
green parachutes covering the
ceiling; the top of the balcony
will be decorated in green and
blue Christmas lights.

Winter Hours, a pithy band
which last year warmed up for
Let’s Active, will kick off the
night; the Little Saints will
follow and the Hoodoo Gurns,
an appropriately exotic choice,
will headline. Remember, beer
cannot be taken out of the
Warner Center into Doremus so
be sure to bring your buzz with
you.

In addition to all this hoopla
and merry making, Smith ex-
pects to have various actors
roaming the gyms in lion and

gorilla costume, and even
possibly a fire-eating act, may
be in the works.

The season for extended bids

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Assignments Editor

 

You know Fancy Dress is
right around the corner when
National Condom Week arrives.

“Rubber week’’ ran from
Feb. 14-21. “FD Week” starts
Monday.

The real reason our nation’s
movers and shakers scheduled
National Condom Week for
when they did was not to get
students at Syracuse University
to send condomgrams to their
not-quite-so-responsible loved
ones on Valentines Day,
although more than 300 were
sold.

And the real reason that mag-
azines are just now beginning to
allow condom ads is_ not
because of a fear of AIDS. Both
are in recognition of what we all
call ‘‘the South’s Greatest Par-
ty.”
FD couldn't have received
that nickname by just being an
overblown prom in a Lexington,
Va., gym. It couldn't have
received that name if it were
simply a gathering of a big band
and a smattering of pretty good
rock bands.

The fact is that this place
rocks on FD weekend, especial-
ly the dorms, Woods Creek, and
the fraternitv houses. Enter Na-
tional Condom Week and date-

rape seminars.
If you want to see the effect

that condomization has had,
hang out in McCrum’s tor a
while and see how many people

— guys and gals — buy boxes of
Sporting goods. But increased
condom sales are not the only
indication that it’s beginning to
look a lot like FD.

There are the easily recog-
nizable signs — flower and tux
sales, a mad rush at the dry
cleaners, the constant talk
about “‘extending the bid.”

Groups of young men swarm
around one of their buddies,
chanting “Ask her. Ask her.’’
With coeducation, girls are say-
ing, ‘‘Ask him. Ask him.”

Frat houses return to life,
even on weekdays. Swarms of
girls, even ones with tattoos on
their backs, are everywhere,
especially in the Pit on band
nights. Road chicks start phon-
ing W&L guys they had met the
first week of school, and vice
versa. ‘‘Hi, remember me ....’’

Bid seekers get their hair cut
and start dressing nicely. Slobs
like myself clean their rooms.

Drug and alcohol use both in-
crease.

One-week wonders wallow in
the weightroom. Everyone’s on
a diet, trying to slim down or
bulk up.

Professors get involved, too.
They seem to increase the
number tests, papers and com-
puter assignments. And they’re
always due at precisely the
time your date’s supposed to ar-
rive or leave, or at the exact
moment you feel like sleeping
off the weekend.

Even parents get in the act.
Some don’t want you to spend

any money. Others will send
money in hopes that their sons
and daughters will get dates.

Girls are flipping coins, draw-
ing slips of paper out of hats and
throwing darts, among other
things, in order to decide whom
to ask, or whether or not to say
“tyes” or ‘“‘no.”’

Soon there will be increased
animosity toward the SAB.
There will be complaints about
the bands, the theme, the shirts
and the posters. Anyone who’d
complain about the cost already
has been doing so since the SAB
lost $17,000 on the Spinners, if
not before.

Condom Week was a new
sign. So was an outbreak of
crabs in the dorms. One of the
most surprising signs has been
the recent resurgence of anti-
coed sentiment. Obviously, they
are bracing all of us for the an-
nouncement that the phrase
“extending the bid”’ is somehow
sexist, and that to say it may be
considered a major offense
under university rules.

About the only sign that didn’t
make sense was the close prox-
imity of FD and Black History
Month, which was held in Feb-
ruary. But with this year’s
theme — The Dark Continent
—all the pieces seem to fit
together.

Okay, so maybe we are a few
weeks behind everyone else on
Black History Month and Na-
tional Condom Week. Then
again, we were years behind on
coeducation.

The official date given for the
first Fancy Dress Ball is
February 1907. That’s eighty
years ago, for those of you
without a calculator. But that’s
not, necessarily, eighty Fancy
Dress Balls. Indeed, the history
of our little winter term shindig
is rich with anecdote and
cultural significance.

It is appropriate that we look
back at the origins of Fancy
Dress on this, its eightieth birth-
day. Although the common
belief is that a one Miss Annie
Jo White started FD all those
years ago, actually the idea of a
major ball was brewing long
before her initial efforts

The first reference to a ‘‘Fan-
cy Dress”’ anything was a blurb
in the September 27, 1876 isssue
of the Southern Collegian concer-
ning a ‘‘Fancy Dress Hop’’. For
nearly a decade before that,
however, students here had
been putting on dances and hops

Fancy Dress: Eighty years and counting

The first real Fancy Dress
Ball came a decade later. The
school’s then-current librarian,
Miss Annie Jo White, enter-
tained a group of her student
friends with a costume party
one February evening in 1907.
Because she felt that the
students needed something to
spark up the mid-winter dull-
ness, she sought to make the af-
fair an annual event.

It took some doing, but she
eventually rustled up enough
student enthusiasm to make the
Fancy Dress Ball one of the
highlights of the W&L social
calendar. Miss White was the
undisputed Queen of Fancy
Dress for 13 years, and in later
years was even paid $50 for her
services.

It was after her death in 1922,
however, that the Fancy Dress
Ball really took off. By 1928, the
New York Times described it as
“the South’s outstanding col-

ball was something entirely dif-
ferent from the event we
celebrate now. For starters, it
was a costume ball, elaborate
and glittering, with exotic Euro-
pean themes setting the pace.
Famous big bands frequented
the ball, and the music was
routinely broadcast on network
radio hook-ups all over the na-
tion. Fancy Dress, it has been
observed, began the same year
Henry Ford was working on the

 

first Model T: It was the
quintessence of the Edwardian
Age.

Fancy Dress was elaborate,
aristocratic, imaginitive, and
even perhaps snobbish. But it
was born out of an ernest desire
to create a wonderland here on
campus, and more often than
not, succeeded.

There were no Fancy Dress
Balls during the second World
War, and the tradition didn’t
quite survive the turbulant Six-
ties, but through it all, Fancy
Dress just seems to keep crop-
ping up every winter. Like a
breath of fresh air.

Off to the ballroom, ladies
and gentlemen.

The group that MTVee-Jay
Martha Quinn calls ‘‘The
Ugliest Band In Rock and Roll”
will take the stage Thursday
night at the student activities
pavillion for a show that pro-
mises to be a real crowd
pleaser.

Otherwise known as the Del

Fuegos, this gritty, unMTV
foursome packs a power-chord
punch that never quits from the
word ‘‘Go!”’ The guitar-playing
Zanes brothers front the act
with Warren’s fiery, raw guitar
lead providing a devilish ac-
companiment for Don’s confi-
dent cigarette growl-whine
and rythm guitar. Bassist Tom
Lloyd and drummer Woody
Giessmann round out the band
and drive the tunes home, per-
forming as well as a rhythm
section twice their size. Despite
the economical line-up, the Del
Fuegos have a big sound that
pounds its way into listeners of
all tastes.
. Songs from their 1985 release,
Boston, Mass. constitue the bulk
of their live material. The
album chronicles a rock band’s
existence on the road and at
home, studded with failed
romances, old cars, nightclubs,
and loneliness, performed in a
traditional style that recalls the
rock and roll hooks of the mid-
60’s and the New Wave intensity
of the early eighties.

Del Fuegos win

Want You’’ drifts along on a sea
of watery keyboards and loose
guitar work that Doors fans will
recognize from ‘‘Riders On The
Storm.’’ Don Zanes hoarsely
rumbles, ‘“‘The car we bought
together just started to
rust/The world we made came
between the two of us,”’ lending
a unigue touch that gives this
tale of adolescence an honesty
missing from today’s formula
rock.

The real grabber on the
record is the number ‘Don’t
Run Wild,’ where Don ad-
monishes his girlfriend at home
to stay true. His entreaty might
also serve to keep those Fancy
Dress dates in line. Later,
Zanes assures her that “It’s
Alright,”’ purring, “I love you
baby, I love your cat/I love the
way you look at my fireman’s
hat.” Truly a line to sweep any
female of her feet — if you're a
Del Fuego.

In ‘Fade To Blue,’’ Don in-
forms the object of his affec-

ugly...

tions that ‘‘I Believe I should be
the one, so I’ve come to help you
take him down.”’ However, the
boys are not all braggadocio, as
they croon wistfully for
“somebody whose days keep
troubled nights away.” This
dream-girl arrives at night to
whisk them away in her ‘‘Coup
de ’’ille.”’

Despite little commercial
success, concertgoers may
recognize the band from the
Miller beer commercials in
which they performed “‘Miller’s
made the American Way.”’
Warren Zanes makes a cameo
appearence at the end, saying,
“Rock and roll is just folk
music...’cos_ it’s made by
folks.’

The Del Fuegos blend
together this street-tough
honesty, classic rock and roll,
and the Eighties oomph to per-
form irristibly. An added bonus
in case you decide to buy the
album is a little free advice:
“Play this record loud.”

Concrete Blonde: Ready to make history

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Entertainment Editor

 

 

On Johnette Napolitano’s
ninth birthday, she received a
guitar and a “Play Guitar with
The Ventures” record as a gift
And the rest, they say, is pup
history.

Well, maybe not. Let’s try
again. Jim Mankey met
Johnette while playing with
Leon Russell in 1980, decided to
form their own band, called it
Dream 6, put out a couple of
records, made it big in Europe,
changed their name to Concrete
Blond, got a new drummer, and
the rest, they say, is pop
history.

One last try: Concrete Blonde
is a power rock trio from Los
Angeles fronted by a woman
who has been favorably com-
pared to Chrissie Hynde but
who is as much her own person
as youor I.

Concrete Blonde is one
blistering rock and roll bnad.

Concrete Blonde is opening up
for The Del Fuegos. So don’t
miss them.

Still not satisfied? The band’s
first album was released on
I.R.S. records this year and has
already become a staple on col-
lege radio stations all over the
country, including our own in-
famous WLUR. One track,
“Still in Hollywood,” is current-
ly enjoying medium rotation as
a video on MTV and would pro- ;
bably find it’s way onto
WLUR’s airwaves if the DJ’s
had a means to beep out a cer-
tain four letter expletive used in
the song’s lyric. Nonetheless,
the record contains plenty of
other stand out tracks, in-
cluding ‘“True,”’ “Beware of
Darkness,”’ and “Dance Along
the Edge.”’

The band’s sound is classic
trio rock somewhere between
the Gang of Four and the Who.
Johnette’s powerful lead vocals

   

 

 

have predictably illicited com-
parisions to the Pretenders, Pat
Benetar, and Joan Jett. But
Concrete Blonde has a sound
distinctively their own.

What do the critics have to
say about Concrete. Blonde?
Cashbox, in their standard cor-
porate view, said, “Will garner
play if anyone takes time to
listen.’’ Which says nothing.
Music Connection, on the other
hand, wrote , “‘About once or
twice a year, a record from an

unknown band just blows me
away, and this is one of them.
Perhaps it should just be called
great rock and roll.” And Rock
Non Stop, a rock magazine from
France, perhaps put it best:
‘*..inconnu, presque tarte, sous
la pochette un peu froide, pas
immediatement sexy...un rock
americain eighties-
californiennes...’’ Which about
says it all.

Don’t get the idea that Con-
crete Blonde is a bunch of

 

 

 
 

rookies. As Dream 6, they made
quite a reputation for
themselves as an outfit to be
reckoned with. But record com-
pany after record company,
though showing interest, felt
there were just too many rough
edges for the band to make it in
mainstream Americana. So
Dream 6 kept turning down of-
fers.

Then one day Miles Copland,
unwittingly saw the band and
said, “Sign ’em up, as is!”

Which is what Miles did. The
final icing on the cake was their
meeting Michael Stipe, who, in
his typically obscure manner,
dubbed the band Concrete
Blonde. Mr. Stipe could not be
reached for comment. Johnette
liked the name, saying, ‘Yeah,
like a dirty Hollywood sidewalk
name, maybe a little hard but a
little soft...and we’re not even
blonde! OK!”

And finally, the rest, they say,
is pop history.

Hoodoo Gurus: Pre-fab neo-paisley hip?

By JIM BENNETT
Staff Reporter

 

The Hoodoo Gurus. Who are
they and what kind of name is
that?

The answer is fun music that
will get you smiling, dancing
and trying that much harder to
get a date for Friday night.
These boys from Down Under
were into paisley before it
became hip, but don’t let that
give you any wrong ideas about
their music. What they play is
not neo-psychedelia but good
time/high energy music that
launched them onto the college
charts some two years ago with
their debut album Stoneage
Romeos.

Their second release Mars
Needs Guitars further solidified
their North American base of
admirers with such hits as “‘Bit-
tersweet’’ and ‘‘Death-
Defying,” helping to put it in the
No. 1 position on the college
charts.

Their latest record, Blow Your
Cool, has just been released and
will undoubtedly be treated to
our ears Friday night.

“(It’s our) earnest desire to
animate the music and au-
dience simultaneously’ says
Dave Faulkner, the lead singer,
rhythm guitar, and songwriter
who formed the band in Pertn
seven years ago. The other
blokes in the band aren’t too
shabby either. Brad Shepard

handles lead guitar (and
sometimes vocals). Clyde
Bramley, on bass, and Mark
Kingsmill on drums form the
tight rhythm section that con-
tributed to the sellout crowds in
Australia and New Zealand.

Between March 21 and May
18, the Hoodoo Gurus will cover
the eastern seabord of the U.S.
and Canada, down to Florida,
across the south and mid-west,
up to Vancouver and down the
west coast. Like their good-
time/high energy music,
they’re moving fast and not to
be missed. Perhaps it’s a com-
bination of isolation and _in-
fluence that has bred the unique
hybridgs of style coming from
these Australian musicians.
Whatever the secret, these guys
have a proven ability to cut it on
the concert circuit, sell records
and garner critical acclaim.

The blokes:

Dave Faulkner, is a child of
the baby boom. A
knowledgeable exponent of pop
culture, he admits to being in-
trigued by writers of such
diverse eras and styles as
Rogers and Hart, Irving Berlin,
Frank Loesser and Hoagy Car-
michael. Unlike many pop
songs, the work of these musi-
cians often reveals unusual
rhyming and rhythm patterns,
verse and chorus structure.
He’s also equally at home
listening to a 50’s do-wop disc as
he is a synth-pop masterpiece.
Dave Faulkner’s songs can’t be

neatly boxed, but straddle

many catagories and when
played with the group’s high
energy and good humor, the
results invariably induce strong
and positive reactions from
fans and critics alike.

Brad Shepherd plays with in-
credible versatility and has
been accused of ‘cutting loose
all over the place with some
scorching licks.’ Then someone
else said he had ‘‘the best from
the book of Psychedelia’s
Greatest Hits.”” But don’t ask
about his humor or mimicry —
it’s wicked.

Tuxedo Rentals

Clyde Bramley and drummer
Mark Kingsmill for the super-
tight rhythm section. A demon
drummer, Mark conserves his
energy between gigs collecting
and reading old comic books,
particularly American.

But wait a minute. Maybe
you've still skeptical and you

~ want to know what the critics

say. How ‘bout the words
“never have a band sounded
this good” from Melody Maker
which, unfortunately, you rare-
ly see in Lexington. If you don’t
believe them or me, check out
