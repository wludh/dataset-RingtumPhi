Holiday’s
validity

questioned

From The New York Times
By LENA WILLIAMS

 

 

WASHINGTON — One year after
the civil rights struggles of the Rev.
Martin Luther King, Jr. were of-
ficially recognized by the federal
government with a national holiday
in his honor, some of the controversy
that surrounded efforts to win that
recognition has not yet been resolv-
ed.

Forty states and four United States
territories observed official holidays
this year honoring King with par-
ades, concerts, speeches and other
programs. Most of those celebrations
took place Monday, Jan. 19, the third
Monday in January, which was
designated by Congress as the of-
ficial national holiday.

Some states and cities have
designated Jan. 15, King’s actual
birthday, as the official holiday.

Easter clashes with class

By GEORGE G. SPARACIO
Staff Reporter

 

Spring Term classes will begin
Monday, April 20, the day after
Easter. Dean Peppers, the chairman
of the Faculty Executive Committee,
said that, even if the students peti-
tion, no changes could be made in the
calendar at such a late date.

Steven R. Doran ’87 brought this
conflict to the attention of the
Washington and Lee community in
his Jan. 8 letter to the Phi. Doran said
that Easter is ‘‘a time when families
and friends gather together and visit,
a sometimes infrequent opportuni-
ty.’’ However, the feeling of students
in general is one of indifference. In
addition, it does not seem as though
the faculty put much thought into the
matter when they passed the calen-
der.

Coach McHenry, the Director of
Athletics, faculty advisor to The
Fellowship of Christian Athletes and
member of The Committee on Regis-
tration and Class Schedules, said that
although it is difficult to travel on the
Easter, “I would be much more of-

Honorary ODK initiates (left to right) John W. Warner, Robert W. Meador, Shuford

fended if classes started on a holi-
day.”

Scott Dittman, chairman of The
Committee on Registration and Class
Schedules, said that the question of
religious observance was considered
at the last faculty meeting. A motion
was passed that reads: ‘“The Univer-
sity recognizes the importance of ho-
ly day celebrations and enceurages
all faculty to make any accommoda-
tions necessary for student obser-
vances.’’ However, this motion was
in reference to school beginning on
Rosh Hashanah in 1988.

Although it would be difficult to
respect all religious holidays, the

issue was avoided with this state-
ment. Coach McHenry did not recall

of the question of Easter even being
addressed at the time when the 86-87
calendar was approved.

President Wilson said that there
are always conflicts with the calen-
dar. “It’s a tortured kind of pro-
blem....The University could and
should pay more attention.”

ODK inducts new members

 

By MARGARET PIMBLETT
Staff Reporter

 

As part of Monday’s Founders’
Day celebration, 23 students and four
honorary initiates were inducted into
Omicron Delta Kappa, the national
collegiate honor fraternity which was
founded at Washington and Lee in
1914.

Henry J. Abraham, the James
Hart Professor of Government and
Foreign Affairs at the University of
Virginia, was the principal speaker.

W&L’s Alpha Circle of ODK was
founded by a group of W&L students
to honor leadership and service in
various aspects of campus life.

The honorary initiates were:
Robert W. Meador, senior vice presi-
dent of Dominion Bank of Lexington
and an active community volunteer:
John Edmonds Neill, a 1938 graduate

and retired businessman from South-
ern Pines, N.C.; Shuford Reinhardt
Nichols, a 1930 graduate and presi-
dent of Southern Compress Co. in
North Little Rock, Ark.; and John W.
Warner, ‘49 graduate and Virginia’s
senior Senator from Middleburg, Va.

Meador, a native of Vinton, joined
the First National Exchange Bank
(now Dominion Bank) in 1960. He
was named chief executive officer of
the Lexington operation in 1975, was
named a senior vice president of
Dominion in 1980, and continues to
head the Lexington operation of
Dominion

He has been state president of the
Virginia Jaycees, organizing presi-
dent of the Lexington Downtown
Development Association, and presi-
dent of the Lexington-Rockbridge
Chamber of Commerce, and is cur-
rently treasurer of the Historic Lex-
ington Foundation

A. as te ce
In times past

Calendar problems date back to
Robert E. Lee’s term as President
of Washington College. This anec-
dote comes from Fredrick L.
Riley’s book, ‘General Robert E.
Lee after Appomatox,”’ upon sug-
gestion from President Wilson.

The students were to receive on-
ly Christmas day off from classes.
This being the case, the students
petitioned for a week-long holi-
day. The petition was rejected by
President Lee. The students then
circulated another petition pledg-
ing that all signers would not at-
tend classes during Christmas
week. The faculty were going to
cancel classes as well. However,
Lee took a stand. He announced
that any student whose name ap-
peared on the petition would be
expelled. If all the students sign-
ed, the college would close.

Needless to say, there was a
mad charge by students to strike
their names from the list.

Th. VVV)King honored

in celebration

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Assignments Editor

 

The white lapel ribbons contrasted
sharply with the black tuxedo jackets
worn by the members of Washington
and Lee’s Glee Club on Monday
night.

The ribbons were a small but visi-
ble part of the Martin Luther King
Day celebration held at the First
Baptist Church in Lexington. Some
members of the W&L community
wore the ribbons throughout the day
in remembrance of King’s vision of
brotherhood and equality.

About 250 people — mostly students
and faculty from W&L and the neigh-
boring Virginia Military Institute
—attended the ceremony, which was
sponsored by the W&L Minority Stu-
dent Association. More than half of
the people there were white.

Guest speaker Johnny E. Morri-
son, commonwealth’s attorney for
the city of Portsmouth, admonished
the audience to keep alive King’s
dream of peace and unity.

At a schoolwide gathering earlier
in the day, W&L President John D.
Wilson also cited King’s dream.

Wearing a white ribbon to the
Founder’s Day ceremony in Lee Cha-
pel, Wilson noted that King and
Robert E. Lee were similar in that
they both worked for reconciliation
and understanding. Lee became
president of W&L after the Civil War
because he wanted to help end

regional misunderstanding. Until his
death in 1968, King led a peaceful yet
powerful fight against racial misun-
derstanding.

Morrison, 34, said that we all must
stop blaming others for our own pro-
blems. But he also implied that many
of our woes are the fault of President
Ronald Reagan.

“He’s a nice person. But he’s not
right for America,’ Morrison said.
Many in the crowd applauded.

One of the first blacks to graduate
from W&L, Morrison said that when
he was young, there were things he
couldn’t do and places he couldn’t go
because he was black. That has
changed because of men like King,
but other problems still exist.

If King were alive today, he would
ask Ronald Reagan some tough ques-
tions about South Africa, the drug
situation and other topics of concern,
Morrison said. He would ask why
billions of dollars were being spent on
sophisticated weaponry instead of
education. But he also would call
upon us to do our best and develop
self-respect.

We must sit down and talk about
problems such as teenage pregnancy
and the dropout rate, Morrison said.
Parents must start spending more
quality time with their children. And
college students must start giving
more to the community, to start be-
ing more concerned about the less
fortunate, about senior citizens.

Morrison stressed that King was a
force across the entire nation, the
type of person who was willing to pay
the price and make the sacrifice. And
yet he was human, like us.

“Martin was a drum major for
justice. He was a drum major for
peace,” Morrison said. ‘‘It all come
back to the basic principle, which is
to help your fellow man.”’

Morrison received both his under-

. graduate and law degrees from

W&L. A Portsmouth native, he is in
his second term as commonwealth’s
attorney.

Earlier in the day, he received the
third annual Martin Luther King, Jr.
Achievement Award from Old Domi-
nion University for exemplifying the
ideals and philosophy of King.

Symposium to be
held on sororities

 

By VALERIE PIERSON
Staff Reporter

 

The Women’s Forum has planned a
symposium entitled ‘Sororities and
Alternatives,’’ for Saturday, January
24, in the Moot Court Room in Lewis
Hall.

Working in conjunction with the
Sorority Advisory Committee, the
Women’s Forum will begin the sym-
posium at 9 a.m. with a continental
breakfast. Representatives from
Dickinson College, the University of
the South and the University of Rich-
mond will make presentations ex-
plaining their different approaches to
social outlets for women.

The goal of the symposium is to in-
form the women at Washington and
Lee of the many social alternatives
available. At Dickinson College there
are nationally affiliated sororities,
and at the University of the South,
there are local sororities.

Following the general format of the
fraternity symposium held last fall,
each school will have fifteen minutes
to make its presentation. A question
and answer session will immediately
follow the presentation in order to
allow as many opinions as possible to
be expressed.

Sophomore Elizabeth Cummins, a
member of the Sorority Advisory
Committee, commented, ‘We're
looking not only for a social outlet,
but also an educational one with
possibilities for leadership, friend-
ship and unity.”’

Sophomore Caroline Boone added
that the symposium will be extreme-
ly open to any ideas proposed, and
she was hopeful that people with dif-
ferent opinions would show up for the
symposium. Invitations were sent to
all undergraduate women, all women
faculty members, as well as to the
administration. ‘‘Sororities and

to the public, and any interested peo-
ple are encouraged to attend.

Sampson estimated that the
Roanokers were between 50 and 75
yards away. He said he knew he
could not shoot the dart that far but
thought that it might intimidate
them.

“It was not out of malice. It was out
of anger,’’ Sampson said.

He said he did not even know the
dart had hit anyone until the next
day. He wrote the girl an apology

Murray said the dart was at least
four inches long

It hit the girl in the back of the

OPINION

The Ring-tum Phi, January 22, 1987

 

To the board

President Wilson did not give his annual state of the univer-
sity speech during the ODK convocation, a subject too impor-
tant not to be addressed.

Borrowing from Wilson’s speech given last year at this
time, it is safe to say that the state of Washington and Lee is
basically sound, basically but not entirely.

Everyone associated with Washington and Lee is proud
and fiercely protects this changing institution, and no one can
deny that W&L has changed in the last few years.

Members of the class of 87 are in a unique position: half of
their collegiate career was spent at an all-male institution,
and half at a coeducated one. While it is, in all probability,
futile to discuss the merits and demerits of coeducation, one
aspect of that radical move deserves to be discussed.

For over two hundred years this university was all male
and produced many men of high stature. To act as if the
University was founded on July 14, 1984 is to do a disservice,,
not only to those who graduated before that infamous date,,
but also to succeeding generations of W&L students. There is
a rich tradition of excellence at W&L, a tradtion impossible
acquire in a little over two years. The present university
reads well on paper, but it takes more than pieces of paper to
create a university.

Another decision was made in July of 1984, one that can be
changed with relative ease. To increase the size of the stu-
dent body is detrimental to the well-being of the university.

Our size is one of the few remaining characteristics that sets;
us apart from your run-of-the-mill university.

Classes that once contained no more, if not less than 12 or
15 students, now have 25 to 30 students in them. It is easy to
think that both students and teachers are losing out on
something as class sizes increase. One-on-one relationships
are beneficial — even more so when such a relationship ex-
ists between a teacher and a student. If a professor teaches
three classes, how can such relationships thrive? Are the
days of classes with only three or four students in them on
their way out?

Another subject that warrants discussion is the teaching
system at W&L. Professors at this acclaimed university
teach first, publish second; teaching after all is their chosen
profession. To force them to publish is to force them to take
time away from teaching. Is this a university or a publishing
house?

The board of trustees meets in Lexington in a few weeks. It
is hoped that they will address the issues raised in this
editorial. Washington and Lee joined the ranks of just about
every other university in the country by becoming coedu-
cated. But it still has the right stuff (apologies to Mr. Wolfe
for the pun) to set it apart from other universities. Decisions
made by the board of trustees will determine whether or not
this happens.

Sacred

It is disturbing that Spring Term classes will begin on
Easter Monday this year. Easter is the most important date
in the Christian calendar. Christ’s resurrection symbolizes
man’s ability to overcome death and live eternally. As the
calendar stands now, observance of this event will be cut
short.

President Wilson was correct in saying that ‘‘The Universi-
ty could and should pay more attention (to conflicts with the
calendar due to religious holidays). What is also troubling is-
Dean Peppers’ comment that no changes in the calendar
could he made at such a late date. It is ironic that man can
overcome death, but he cannot overcome bureaucratic red
tape.

While changing the calendar at such a late date may be in-
convenient for those who take care of such things, there is
precedent for change.

During the 1983-84 school year, Winter Term classes were
scheduled to begin on January 2, a Monday. The powers that
be decided that they did not want the students travelling back
to Lexington on New Year’s Day. Classes that first week of
the term were held from Tuesday through Saturday. .

There is a difference between New Year’s Day and Easter
Sunday. While New Year’s Day appears to have lost
whatever religious significance it once had, Easter Sunday
has not. If the calendar could be changed to allow students
extra time to party, a change could certainly be made so they
can observe Christ’s resurrection.

US movies cause misconception

 

MY VIEW
By Paul J. Smith

 

Movies are fun. They’re creative,
imaginative, and exciting. Funda-
mental to American culture, they
portray our lives, debate our issues,
suffer through our tribulations.
Movies are as American as apple pie,
and Chevy trucks.

But wait...What many Americans
-~ not realize is that their life-
styles, beliefs, sexual habits,
etc..which movies are so consciously
trying to portray on the big screen for
all Americans are available for the
whole world as well. From Peking to
Paris, Sydney to Stockholm, the
fruits of Hollywood are for everyone
to enjoy.

In this respect, American movies
are more than just modes of enter-
tainment. In fact, movies become
vehicles of cultural export, which
leads to a phenomenon best describ-
ed as ‘‘misconception panorama.”’

For example, last year as an ex-
change student in Taiwan, I was ap-

proached on one occasion by a stu-
dent who asked me how many gun-
fights I had witnessed while living in
America. ‘“‘None’’, I answered rather
dumbfounded. He insisted, however,
that he had seen many gunfights in
movies between police and drug
dealers, or between gangsters.
“That’s not reality,” I protested. He
walked away somewhat confused.

Ona recent trip to Tokyo, I met one
Japanese who told me at the outset of
our encounter, ‘‘I don’t like Ameri-
cans.”’ Somewhat caught off guard, I
tried to squeeze out “Why is that?”’
“They are materialistic, ruthless,
uncaring people,”’ he replied. I asked
him if he had been to America. ‘“‘NO”’
he replied. It turns out that he had
recently seen the movie ‘To Live and
Die in LA,” a movie that portrays
just the sort of society he described. I
tried to convince him that the U.S.
was not as bad as the movie por-
trayed. But in the end, I don’t think
he was convinced.

One Japanese with whom I spoke in
Tokyo went so far as to formulate a
very negative opinion on the Ameri-
can political system based on a
movie she had recently seen called
“POWER” starring Richard Gere.
As a member of the voting public of

Japan, there is very good chance that
she will vote for a party opposed to
improved U.S.-Japanese relations,
because of one movie. She has never
been to the United States.

Movies, I am convinced, are pro-
bably the single most important
media source on which foreigners
formulate their impressions and
opinions of the U.S. Whether the
movie’s subject is near or far from
the truth, its images are concrete and
convincing. When people see events
whether on the screen or in reality,
they consider, deliberate, and judge.
Finally, they develop opinions which
can, depending on the type of polit-
ical system, support or oppose im-
proved relations with the U.S.

In this capacity, movies probably
have more impact on the success or
failure of American foreign policy
than the U.S. government supported
Voice of America, Radio Free
Europe, or publications of the U.S.
Information Agency. Movies, put
simply, can have a tremendous im-
pact on American diplomatic efforts
abroad. Consider this: The U.S.
wishes to improve relations with a
nation where sexual promiscuity is
taboo. Practically any rated ‘“R”’
American movie would portray a

negative image of the U.S. among the
populace. Or, for exainple, take a.
communist or socialist nation, with
which the U.S. would like improved ‘
relations. A film such as “Rambo,
First Blood Part II” would leave
much to be desired in this nation, for
obvious reasons.

But nothing drives this point home
like an experience I had last year. A
group of Chinese classmates and I
were watching a rather lewd and ,
sexy American film. Suddenly
without warning the heroine started
doing something with the hero in an
explicit manner.

“I didn’t know American girls
were like this,’ one Chinese ~
classmate says.

“Uh...well, sometimes.” I say,
feeling somewhat exposed, the same

way one would feel if his own family ‘

films were being viewed by
strangers. ‘‘Why can’t they keep this
stuff within the country,” I whisper
to myself.

“Pardon?”

“Uh...I say, “I wish we could ‘

watch another channel.”
“Sure, but this is from your coun-
try. You should like it,”’ they insist.
“Oh, but I do,” I confess. And we
continue to watch.

Student groups must work together

 

MY VIEW
By Dana Bolden

 

 

I realize that the Ring-tum Phi is
not the place for fairy tales, but let
me share this one.

Once upon time there was a college
campus (Washington and Lee’s if you
must) and the most effective organi-
zations on this campus were the ones
that were student run. These
organizations always accomplished
their goals and worked together.
Then one day a strange fog settled
over this campus and caught it by
surprise. Everything that was stu-
dent run seemed to fall apart and
none of the groups wanted to work
together anymore.

One day, one of the groups on cam-

To the Editors:

of the bylaws from the IFC.

 

It amazes me that the replacement of Coke
with Pepsi stirs a greater amount of interest
than the proposed overhauling of the IFC con-
stitution. The professed goal of these changes is
to substantially decrease the amount of “‘party-
ing’’ and increase the amount of studying. The
lack of bylaws encouraging people “‘to stay in
Lexington and study” and the number of bylaws
covering fraternity social activities may cause
some people to accuse Buddy Atkins not of play-
ing charades, but of screening the true intentions

pus wanted to have a celebration to
honor one of their heroes. The
members in the group worked dili-
gently to organize this celebration.
One member wrote an article for the
student run newspaper and described
everything that was going to happen.
Now in this article he also asked
everyone to wear a ribbon in honor of
their hero in hopes that this might br-
ing back the unity between these
groups. Much to the members
dismay, the paper came out and con-
tained nothing about the group’s
celebration nor their ribbons. Not on-
ly did this hurt the groups pride, I’m
sure it hurt the turnout at the
celebration also. However, all was
not lost for the group because two
other student run groups helped out,
the radio and television stations, by
annoucing the celebration over the
airwaves.

The day after this dilemma oc-
curred, the student run government
requested that the members of this

same group present their budget,
less than one hour before their
celebration was to begin. Although
the members thought this was a
great inconvenience they agreed to
go and decided they would use this
opportunity to extend a special in-
vitation to the members of the stu-
dent government. Well, the celebra-
tion began and one of the members of
the group who was on stage scanned
the audience high and low looking for
any of the members of the student
government. Finally, about five
minutes before the celebration ended
one of the brave members of student
government showed up. Since both
the celebration group member and
student government member were
good friends, the member on the
stage figured “better late than
never.”

It was obvious that the fog still had
not left the campus. One day two
students got together and wanted to
organize a group to bring more diver-

even harsher provisions.

OPINION/NE

LEXICON

 

By Steve Pockrass

-reshman idealism
turns to apathy

“Barf!”

That was my gut reaction when I read Jennifer Spreng’s first “‘My

View” in the Phi on Oct. 16.

When I read her Jan. 15 ‘“‘My View,”’ I just shook my head.

The first column was an orgasmic outpouring of loyalty to W&L ex-
hibited by a wide-eyed, idealistic freshman. The most recent was an
explanation of why that same freshman no longer cared about the

truth of the Iran/Contra scandal.

It is a textbook example of the changes that seem to occur among

many college students.

In her first “‘My View,’’ Miss Spreng wrote, ‘“‘W&L is not a place to
be, but a way of life.” I hope she’s wrong. The true W&L way of life
seems to be better exemplified by her most recent column.

Once upon a time, probably not too long ago, Miss Spreng ‘‘was quite
the little activist.” But now she doesn’t care. Instead of becoming ex-
cited or even curious, she writes, ‘(Maybe the only healthy policy is to
assume the best of everyone, and hope that eventually it does not
become necessary to believe the worst.”

We've been told that the purpose of a liberal arts education is to
make students think. It is supposed to expand our minds, not just our
future bank accounts. When we say that we don’t care about the facts,
that we’re not interested in the search for Truth or the truth, then we

are wasting our time.

I’m not writing this out of disdain or disrespect for Miss Spreng.
She’s active and intelligent. She writes well and is a budding star on

the W&L debate team.

I’m writing this because I’m afraid that many of our nation’s col-
leges are stuffing students’ heads with facts and figures instead of ex-
panding our minds. I’m afraid we’re maturing intellectually but not
mentally, becoming numb instead of inquisitive.

I’ve been told that I'd better not be disillusioned by this, that most of
the people in the ‘real world” are apathetic and ignorant. Having
worked as a professional reporter in that ‘‘real world,”’ I find it sadly
ironic that we who are privileged enough to receive $40,000 and $50,000
educations often are the most ignorant and the most apathetic.

That’s why I hope that three years from now, Miss Spreng will look
back on that first ‘‘My View’ and say ‘‘My, was I naive.”’ And that

~ — she’ll reread that third ‘‘My View” and slap her own wrist.

4 In her first column, Miss Spreng wrote that she saw herself as a
member of a community larger than just W&L, and that here she had
been instilled with a sense of responsibility. “W&L is creating

gentlepeople,’’ she wrote.

As gentlepeople, our primary responsbility is to become well-
informed, caring citizens. We must be defenders of the poor and the
needy, of the infants and the elderly, of the weak and the crippled. We

must fight for unity and equality.

Such was the vision of men like Robert E. Lee and Martin Luther
King, whose birthdays were celebrated earlier this week. These two
leaders did not influence the nation simply by whistling a happy tune.
They asked tough questions. They dreamed great dreams. And they
attempted to make those dreams come true.

So must we.

Bryan to speak on First Amendment

 

By MARGARET PIMBLETT
Staff Reporter

 

J. Stewart Bryan III, publisher of
the Richmond Times-Dispatch and
News Leader, will deliver a lecture
on First Amendment rights Monday
January 26, at 8 p.m. in Lee Chapel.

Bryan is the 1987 recipient of the
First Amendment Award, which is
given anually by the Washington and
Lee chapter of the Society of Profes-
sional Journalists, Sigma Delta Chi.

Bryan is being honored for his
leadership role in the Richmond
newspapers’ litigation that resulted
in a landmark decision by the United
StatesSupreme Court. The Richmond
Newspapers case established that
the closing of a criminal court trial in
the absence of overriding counter in-
terest was invalid under First and
Fourteenth Amendments.

That decision, involving the right
of the press and the public to attend
criminal trials, clarified issues that

were muddied by the uncertain lan-
guage of Gannett v. DePasquale that
resulted in a rash of more than 130
decisions granting court closure in a
twelve month period. The Richmond
Newspapers v. Virginia case involv-
ed a murder trial in the Circuit Court
of Hanover County.

Bryan graduated from the Univer-
sity of Virginia in 1960 with a B.A.
degree in philosophy. He began his
career in journalism after spending
two years with the U.S. Marine Cor-
ps. He served as a reporter for the
Tampa Times and the Richmond
Times-Dispatch until 1968 when he
was named vice-president of the
Tribune Company in Tampa.

He became executive vice-
president of the Tampa papers in
1971 and was named publisher in
1976. In 1978, Bryan became publish-
er of the two Richmond papers.
Elected to the board of directors of
Media General in 1974, Bryan was
named vice chairman in January
1985, and executive vice-president in
October 1985.

 

 

Bryan and W&L connection

The connection between
Washington and Lee University
and J. Stewart Bryan is not a
typical association. Bryan is not a
W&L alumnus, nor has he donated
huge sums of money to build a
gymnasium or endow a professor-
ship.

Bryan, who will deliver a lec-
ture on Monday, January 26 in
Lee Chapel, is the great-grandson
of Joseph and Isobel ‘‘Belle’’
Stewart Bryan.

According to information ob-
tained by Clark R. Mollenhoff,
professor of journalism, Belle
Stewart was a favorite companion
of Robert E. Lee and his family,
During the Civil War, General
Lee’s family had occupied a home
owned by Belle’s father. Belle re-
quested and received from Lee a
photograph, although he replied to
her in a note, ‘I am surprised,

Miss Belle, that you should want
the likeness of an old man when
you can get that of so many young
men, but...1 send the last I have. I
hope it may serve to recall
sometimes one who will never
forget you.”

After Bryan’s marriage to Belle
Stewart in 1871, Lee’s descendants
were frequent guests at the
Stewart family home, Laburnum,
in Richmond. Lee’s West Point
sword was displayed on the
mantel at Laburnum until it was
partially destroyed by a fire in
1906.

The W&L treasurer’s books for
1907-08 record the receipt from
Joseph Bryan of $97.26 for moun-
ting the bones of Traveller, the
general’s favorite horse.

Merritt helps with grade school survey

 

Staff Reports

 

The students in the gifted and
talented program at Lylburn Down-
ing Middle School had some ques-
tions, but they weren’t quite sure how
to find the answers.

The sixth-grade students wanted to
know about students and school
policies. The seventh graders were
interested in extracurricular ac-
tivities for their age group. The pro-
blem, however, was how to create a
survey that reflected student opinion
and was scientifically accurate.

Enter Robert Merritt, a W&L
senior from Springfield, Virginia.

Twice a week for more than a
month, Merritt met with the students
in the gifted and talented program to
help them formulate the questions
for their surveys, write the computer
program for the surveys, and
tabulate the results. Since Merritt
received no academic credit for his
work, it was a labor of love.

“He really did all the back-
breaking work,”’ said Babs Sanders,
director of the gifted and talented
program who worked with Merritt on
the project. ‘‘He was a tremendous
help.”’

Merritt, a senior sociology/an-
thropology major, was recommend-
ed for the project by David Novack,
associate professor of sociology at
W&L. Novack thought Merritt’s ex-
perience with surveys done at
Washington and Lee and for a law
firm might be of use to the students.

By the time Merritt joined the pro-
ject, the students had already written
several questions for the survey.

 

 

 

 

Robert Merritt surrounded by gifted and talented students.

“We talked about theory and what
exactly they were trying to survey,”
Merritt said. “‘We cleaned up the
questions, then the students ad-
ministered the survey.”

Once the students received the
responses to the questions, they
began entering the 8,000 to 10,000
pieces of data at the W&L Computer
Center. Merritt said he was ‘“‘amaz-
ed’’ that the students were 99 percent
accurate in entering the data.

After all the data was entered,

Merritt used a computer program he
wrote to run frequencies and cross
tabulations to glean the results of the
survey. He explained the results to
the students who then developed
reports on what the surveys reveal-
ed.

Merritt said he got involved in the
project ‘‘just because I wanted to
help.’’ He said he ‘‘found the students
to be bright, cooperative, hard work-
ing and attentive.”’ :

“T was really impressed with their

work,”’ he said. “They did better
work than some college students I’ve
seen.”

Sanders, too, was impressed with
the students’ work and had praise tor
Merritt’s commitment to making the
project a success.

“He had a nice way with the
students,’ Sanders said. ‘‘He ex-
plained each step to the students and
why it was necessary to complete one
step before moving on to another. It
was a great experience for all of us.”’

Constitutional Convention will soon begin

By HOLLY WILLIAMS
Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee University
will hold a constitutional convention
to commemorate the bicentennial of
the U.S. Constitution. The event,
which will take place on May 2, 1987,
is the result of more than a year and
a half of study of possible ways to
celebrate the anniversary of the
writing of the Constitution.

Recognizing the University’s his-

toric ties to the Constitution, John D.
Wilson, president of the University,
initiated the examination process by
appointing a planning committee of
professors and students in the fall of
1985. Trustees of the Liberty Hall
Academy were instrumental in the
ratification of the Constitution at the
Virginia State Ratifying Convention
in 1788. In addition, George Washing-
ton, president of the Convention, was
one of the original benefactors of
W&L, and the school is named in
recognition of his generosity.

Although an Article V national con-
vention, the alternative to Congress’s
amending of the Constitution has not
taken place in our history, W&L’s
convention is relevant because 32 out
of the necessary 34 states have peti-
tioned Congress to call a national
convention to consider a balanced
budget amendment.

Amendments proposed through a
national convention must be ratified
by three quarters of the states before
they become part of the Constitution.

The planning committee for the

mock convention has been broken in-
to subcommittees working on rules
and issues, operations, finance,
media, and entertainment. State
chairmen have been appointed for
each state, and lists of their names
are posted around campus. It is not
too late to join a delegation. Peter
Bennorth, chairman of the Mock Con-
stitutional Convention said, ‘‘This is
going to have to be a student project
in order to be successful.”

Last December, Paul Youngman
faced a problem that had already
become familiar to him in the last
year: the unenviable task of handling
seriously intoxicated students.

Youngman, a senior from Rochest-
er, N.Y., and assistant head dormi-
tory counselor, said that since he
became a dorm counselor as a junior,
he’s had to handle such situations
four times.

“The first time I had to deal with
such a situation was last year in the
fall. There was a girl laid out in front
of Graham-Lees dormitory, uncon-
scious, and a number of obviously
drunk guys were standing around
her, unsure of what to do,” said
Youngman.

“One of the guys and myself car-
ried her to her fourth-floor dorm
room and left her there, figuring
she'd recover from the alcohol. But a
few hours later, I learned she had to
go to the hospital due to respiratory
problems, which really shook me
up.

Youngman said she recorded a
blood alcohol level much higher than
the “legally drunk’’ level of .10 per-
cent. Since then, he says he’s been

“overcautious’’ in handling those he
suspects of being extremely intox-
icated.

“The first incident was quite a
scare, when I thought about what
could’ve happened to her. Since then,
I’ve tried to be more careful about
handling such incidents, even if it
means calling the hospital.”

After the original incident,
Youngman encountered the problem
twice more at the dorms, each time
taking precautions so that the intox-
icated person was in no danger. It
was not until last Christmas that he
had to handle a similar situation out-
side of the dorms.

“During our fraternity Christmas
party, one of the pledges got ex-
tremely drunk, and was in pretty bad
shape. It soon became evident that he
needed more help than anyone in the
fraternity could offer, so I called the
hospital,’ Youngman said.

Youngman said that, though he felt
pressured not to call the hospital, an-
continue the ‘Pie-throw,’ ’’ an event
Foundation; Camille Miller, an in-
structor in sociology at W&L; and
to be done. ‘‘There wasn’t any way
we could help the student, and
everyone realized the day after that
it was for the better that he went to
the hospital.”

“I’m no angel myself when it
comes to drinking,” Youngman said,

‘“‘but I know my own limits from ex-
perience. Many of the freshmen
come to school not knowing their
limits, and these are the students
who need watching. Given a party en-
vironment, it’s understandable that
they might get carried away with
alcohol.”’

“However, most of the cases of in-
toxication are less serious, and if we
give the kid a lot of grief about his
drunken condition, he is usually less
apt to go out and do the same thing
again,’’ he added. :

Although Youngman thinks that
the recent change in the drinking age
is “somewhat ridiculous, given its
assumption that an 18-year-old can-
not be trusted to control himself,” he
believes that recent university
pressure on fraternities to enforce
the laws is warranted.

“Given their liability with regard
to alcohol-related accidents involv-
ing fraternities, the university is ina
position where it must obey the
laws,’’ Youngman said.

Have fraternities responded posi-
tively to this pressure? “For the
most part, yes,’ Youngman said.
“Though naturally there is bound to
be some resentment, fraternities are
taking steps in the right direction
toward regulating alcohol consump-
tion at parties, a move that is well-
founded.”’

Slave auction will raise
money for Superdance

By TOM BRICKEL
Staff Reporter

 

The February 7-8 Superdance, an
18-hour fundraiser for the Muscular
Dystrophy Association, has already
raised in excess of $2,500 due to the
efforts of slaves, said Superdance co-
chairman Jim Barker.

Barker was referring to two “‘Slave
Auctions’ recently held at Hollins
and Sweet Briar colleges. These auc-
tions, in which people donate their
time to be ‘auctioned’ off as
“slaves,” and are consequently
“sold” to the highest bidder, have
been successful this year, netting the
Muscular Dystrophy Association ap-
proximately $2,550.

“They (the slave auctions) have
been more successful than we’d ever
imagined possible,” said Barker.
“The auction at Hollins brought in
about $1,800, surpassing the total of
all the auctions held last year. This,
combined with the recent auction at
Sweet Briar, and with the future auc-
tions planned, makes this a banner
year for the event.”’

An auction at Randolph-Macon

Woman’s College is scheduled for
Thursday, January 22.

Slave auctions are an especially ef-
fective part of the Superdance fund-
raiser, for they provide not only an
enjoyable activity for those who want
to help the Superdance effort, but
they promote the event as well.

“The publicity that accompanies
our auctions has a measurable im-
pact on Superdance participation,
especially as concerns the local
women’s colleges,’’ continued
Barker. ‘‘While we have members of
the student recruitment committee
(for the dance) visit local schools and
recruit dancers, the auctions are par-
ticularly effective for the relatively
short period each auction takes.”’

The slave auctions are one of the
many responsibilities of the special
events committee, headed this year
by senior Tom Knight and junior
Greg Knapp. With the exception of
entertainment provided by the
bands, and the time alloted to prize
giveaways, the special events com-
mittee is primarilly responsible for
keeping the dancers busy during the
less active periods of the day.

Pact activities have run the gamut
from the demanding spoon races, to
the physically grueling ‘Simon
Says” with Coach Lord.

‘“‘And,’’ Barker said, ‘‘we hope to
continue the ‘Pie-throw’’ an event
that’s been popular in the past.” This
will be contingent on faculty and ad-
ministration participation. Past par-
ticipants have included former Com-
merce School Dean Atwood, Pro-
fessor Simpson and Coach Miller.

Until the February 7 dance arrives,
the school will have to wait to see
what the special events committee
has planned. A slave auction at W&L
is ‘‘tentative at this point,”’ according
to Knapp. “It will depend not only on
whether there are enough prospec-
tive ‘slaves’ willing to donate their
time, but also if there are enough
people interested in ‘acquiring’
them,” he said.

“‘We’ve tentatively planned on hav-
ing one in the GHQ on Wednesday,
Jan. 28. Although nothing is definite,
given the current interest in the
event, we’re hoping W&L will see a
slave auction this year,” Knapp con-
cluded.

Women’s stress forum scheduled .

Staff Reports

Today more women than ever
struggle to cope with the dual
demands of job and home. The stress
of trying to balance what amounts to
two full-time careers has resulted in
an increase in depression in women
and, in some cases, job burnout. In
an effort to bring these and other
issues closer to home, three local
women have organized a day-long
conference to examine the state of
women’s lives.

“Women Looking Ahead: Pay-
checks, Politics, and Pampers’’ will
be held Saturday, February 28 from
8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. in Room 327 of
W&L’s School of Commerce, Econo-
mics, and Politics.

Co-ordinators for the conference
are Melanie Fure, director of events
at the Virginia Military Institute
Foundation, Camille Miller, an in-
structor in sociology at W&L; and
Lisa Solod, a writer and director of
public information for the Marshall
Foundation. The conferences is sup-

Dean of Students Lewis G. John
said the case had been referred to the
Student Conduct Committee but that
no decisions had been made. Atkins
shaid he would not consider taking
any legal action until after that com-
mittee had ruled on the case.

He stressed that he wanted the Stu-

al support is being provided by
United Virginia Bank, American
Federal Savings and Loan, and
Southern Seminary Junior College.

‘“‘We are all dealing with the issues
associated with managing both
homes and careers and we know that
there are other women in the com-
munity who face similar problems,”
Fure said. When we first conceived
the idea of the conference a little over
a year ago, we thought it would be a
good way to discuss our mutual pro-
blems and try to better educate our-
selves in ways to solve them. We
thought the conference would be a
good way to get women involved ona
local level.”’

Sybil Todd, associate dean at the
University of Virginia and an author
whose specialty is women’s issues,
will deliver the keynote address. In
her address, entitled ‘‘Women’s
Evolving Paths,”’ Todd will examine

decision on the fact that Sampson
was endangering people by shooting
the dart, not because that dart hit his
daughter. He said it would be wrong
for people to assume that because the
girl was related to him, that it would
be handled differently from any
other incident.

Sampson said the blowgun was a
gift from a girlfriend. It is legal to
possess, but Sampson turned it over
to Murray on Friday.

KING

 

O Continued from Page 1

But other local governments are
still wrestling over the merit of yet
another official holiday in honor of a
national hero. States and cities have
the option of deciding whether to
observe a federal holiday by closing
schools and state government of-
fices.

Arizona’s new governor, Evan
Mecham, canceled the state holiday
to honor King, fulfilling a campaign
promise to rescind the executive
order issued by his predecessor, Gov.
Bruce Babbitt, that created a paid
holiday for state employees. The new
Republican governor said Babbitt,
who is a Democrat, had no authority
to create such a holiday. Backers of
the holiday have bitterly criticized
Mecham’s proposal that the issue be
put to a public vote.

Citizens in Tupelo, Miss., and An-

chorage, Alaska, are engaged in dif-
ficult struggles to have streets
renamed for King. In Slidell, La.,
black residents won the right to hold
a parade through the downtown sec-
tion, but they are now struggling to
win ‘“‘some respect’’ from the white
community, some members of
which, they say, view the day as a
“holiday for black people.”’

Many civil rights leaders fear that
such a perception is widespread and
say the holiday ought to be more than
a time for celebration.

“T cautioned the country that it’s
one thing to struggle for a national
holiday, and another thing to cele-
brate it appropriately, and yet still
another to maintain its integrity over
the years,’’ said Coretta Scott King,
King’s widow. ‘“‘We must continue to
be on guard against those who would
make the holiday a black holiday.”

Those who strove to establish a day
in King’s honor acknowledged that it
would take years to institutionalize
the holiday. They noted that 10
states, including Montana, Texas and
North Carolina, have not yet estab-

Abraham’s speech, titled ‘“‘Our En-
during and Evolving Constitution:
Some Reflections,’’ was one of a
series of events celebrating the
bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution.

After listing 13 basic assumptions
that underlie the commitment to con-
stitutionalism, Abraham continued
with some ‘‘Musings On the federal
structures of our system, one that
has indeed been a model for a
number of healthy and less healthy
new and old states abroad.’’ He ex-
amined the relationships between
states’ rights and the federal system,
and cited ‘historical reasons that
prompted the question to become
that of ‘will the component parties-
i.e. the statessurvive’ in the
American system.”’

Abraham also talked about the role
of the judicial system and “its
presumed parameters of power and
authority.,’ He said the question and
problem of the judicial system is how
to ‘‘Harness the judicial role within
its appropriate bounds”’ and to keep
it from becoming a policy maker.

lished such a holiday

Virginia observes a holiday Jan. 15
for Southern heroes, and King is
honored along with such Confederate
heroes as Robert E. Lee and Stone-
wall Jackson.

Some states let employees take the
day off without pay or in exchange
for a paid holiday. Others merely en-
courage employees to take note of
King’s work that day.

Nevertheless, members of the
Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Holi-
day Commission, which was estab-
lished to organize the celebrations,
say they take pride in having been
able to accomplish some degree of
unanimity ina relatively short time.

“‘T think people may be overlooking
the fact that it takes years to institu-
tionalize a national holiday,’ said
Lloyd Davis, executive director of
the commission. ‘‘The observance
for July Fourth didn’t peak until the
1800s. And given that it took George
Washington 80 years to get a holiday,
Columbus 176 years and Lincoln
never made it, it’s rather miraculous
that King received such an honor in

Radio
coverage

planned

By TOM BRICKEL
Staff Reporter

 

“T intend to be dancing when I’m
not in the studio,’’ said Mac Gibson,
music director for WLUR-FM. Gib-
son was referring to WLUR coverage
of the February 7-8 Superdance for
the Muscular Dystrophy Association.

The idea for event-long coverage of
the Superdance was conceived of
four years ago by WLUR staff mem-
bers Bob Halloran and Taylor Hath-
away. Mike Stachura and Cotton
Puryear continued the tradition, re-
maining on the air for 30 hours, the
length of previous Superdances.

Coverage for this year’s Super-
dance, as has been the case in the
past, is extensive: with the exception
of a few hours Saturday afternoon,
the station will again cover the entire
Superdance. There is one difference
this year, however, in that disc
jockeys covering it will get some
sleep.

“We'll be covering the dance in
shifts Superdance weekend,” said
Gibson, who, along with station news
director Tim McMahon, will be in
charge of organizing the coverage.
“They'll rotate in three-hour shifts,
perhaps spending two more hours on
location in the pavilion. Trying to
stay awake will-most likely not be a
problem this-year.”’

The radio rock-a-thon will serve
two purposes this year, according to
Gibson. “Our most important pur-
pose is to raise money for MDA.

18 years.’’ Lincoln’s birthday tech-
nically is not a federal holiday.

When a bill proposing a holiday for
King reached Congress in 1983, op-
ponents led by Jessee Helms, the con-
servative Republican senator from
North Carolina, sought to block it.
President Regan initially opposed
creating another holiday, saying the
nation could not afford to honor all its
heroes. But the measure was passed
by Congress amid heated debate as
the 10th paid holiday for federal
workers. Regan then signed the holi-
day into law

The King day is the first new na-
tional holiday to be proclaimed by
Congress since Thanksgiving was of-
ficially adopted in 1941. King, who
won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, is
the first American to be honored with
a holiday of his own since Washing-
ton,

Many black leaders agree that so
many years after King’s death the
civil rights movement is still trying
to achieve what he was seeking: a
way to bring poor blacks into econo-
mic security and to end racial in-

A bulldozer stands ready beside duPont Hall as the

justice. His widow, who established
the Martin Luther King Center for
Non-Violent Social Change in Atlanta
to carry out his work, acknowledged
that while she has sought to ac-
complish his goals, neither she nor
other rights leaders have succeeded.

King was standing on a balcony of
the Lorraine Motel in Memphis,
Tenn., on April 4, 1968, when he was
shot to death by a sniper, James Earl
Ray. Had King lived, he would have
been 58 last Thursday. Ray was sen-
tenced to life in prison.

Much like the rights movement
that King symbolized, the second na-
tional holiday observances honoring
him will be long on enthusiasm and
short on money. The federal commis-
sion coordinating the ceremonies has
fallen short of its fund-raising goal of
$250,000 for this year; as of Friday,
Jan. 16, it had raised about $100,000.

Bob Dole of Kansas, the leader of
the Senate’s Republican minority,
was among those leading the lobby
on Capitol Hill to create the holiday.
At a news conference last week he ex-
pressed dismay over the lack of sup-

port.

Davis, the federal commission of-
ficial, concedes that he is disap-
pointed that there will no star-
studded television special for King
like the one produced last year by
Stevie Wonder, the entertainer, for
NBC. Instead, the network will
televise the 19th annual Image
Awards program of the National
Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, to honor individuals
and companies that contribute ‘‘posi-
tive images’”’ of black people.

“But that’s not the end-all,”’ Davis
said. “It is essentially a holiday to in-
crease public awareness about Dr
King and his work.

Leaders of the holiday events say
they have generated wide and en-
thusiastic support from a diverse
grouping in this country and abroad.
More than 20 nations have indicated
they will participate in the holiday
with events in their countries or by
sending representatives to the United
States to participate in events in
Washington and Atlanta and at the
United Nations.

Listeners call in, pledging either a $1
donation for a song request, or $2 for
a song dedication. Listeners, how-
ever, are encouraged to donate as
much as they like.”’

Last year’s coverage netted the
MDA over $250. This year’s goal of
$300 has been termed “‘worthy and at-
tainable,”’ according to Gibson.

The second purpose of this year’s
coverage is to celebrate WLUR’s 20th
anniversary. The station first enter-
ed Lexington airwaves in February,
1967.

“This is the reason we'll be on the
air 20 hours instead of the 18 hours
this year’s dance will run. Hopefully,
we'll begin it all at 6 a.m. that morn-
ing — if I’m able to get up,” Gibson
joked.

Because of a contract requiring the
station to carry opera on “Live from
the Met’’ weekly, the dance will not
be broadcast between 2 and 5 p.m.
“The dance should not lose any
money over this,’ said Gibson, ‘‘as
Spiedel, Goodrich, and Lille will be

 

playing during those hours.”

Beginning at 6 a.m. Saturday,
coverage will end at 2 a.m. Sunday
morning. WLUR broadcasts at 91.5
on the FM dial. Anybody wishing to
make a request or a dedication can
call the station at 463-8444.

“Hopefully, our listeners will help
us reach our goal by keeping the
phones busy. Not only will it benefit
the MDA, but it will keep our DJ’s
from getting lonely as well,” con
cluded Gibson.

Generals win big, &

out look

ty MIKE SHADY
\ssistant Sports Editor

 

 

A twenty point victory would
itisfy most people, but not a perfec-
onist like Verne Canfield.

‘It was a sloppy game,” said head
oach Canfield Tuesday night, after
Vashington and Lee basketball team
efeated Eastern Mennonite 80-60 in
ie Warner Center. ‘‘I don’t think you
hould be satisfied with that kind of
ffort.’’

The win left W&L with an even-
teven 3-3 record in the Old Dominion
thletic Conference after a 70-55 vic-
wry over Maryville on Saturday and
n 81-58 defeat at the hands of arch-
val Roanoke College last Thursday.

The Generals had difficulty putting
way an overmatched Eastern Mon-
nite. W&L committed an astound-
g 22 personal fouls over the entire
illgame and sent the Royals to the
1e 30 times. Despite these dif-
tulties, the General’s led at
ilftime 37-28.

‘We weren't sharp as a team,”
id freshman Wes Boyd. ‘It was
finitely a struggle both offensively
ddefensively.”’

“We didn’t play with intensity or
nacity,”’ said Canfield. ‘‘We played
lyin spurts "

Canfield’s assesment was correct
; the Generals appeared to almost

sloppy

coast at times. The game was clearly
a case of W&L being a far superior
team in terms of talent, but they
were unable to capitalize on the 19
turnovers that Eastern Mennonite
handed them.

“There were a lot of two-on-one
situations that we didn’t convert and
that’s just a mental thing,”’ said Can-
field.

Senior Jefferson Harralson and
sophomore Lee Brading had 15 and 14
points respectively and senior Fred
Bissinger chipped in 10 points. It was
the third consecutive game in which
the high-scoring Harralson was held
to less than his 22 point per game
average.

Against the Maryville Scots, the
Generals turned up the “D” and
caused Maryville to cough up the pill
23 times, the most telling and in-
strumental statistic from the win.

“It was a good defensive game,”
said Canfield. ‘“The defense got going
and took away their offense com-
pletely.”’

Junior Steve Hancock scored 17
points, nine of them coming from the
charity stripe. He received assis-
tance from Harralson (11 points) and
Brading (10 points) as well as 10
points from the always ready junior
Lou Trosch.

making even the easy passes 25 feet

[he Men’s and Womens’ varsity
‘imming teams spent last weekend
the road, with the men swimming
ippensburg State, a top-five Divi-
m Il team on Friday, and both
uads double-dueling Georgetown
d Frostburg State at Georgetown
Saturday.

l'he Generals had planned for the
ippensburg meet to be close, and
»y knew that they would have to
im tough to win. Head coach Page

Remillard said that his scouting
reports showed that the Red Raiders
had weekly drops in time this season,
as well as improvements over times
from last year. Unknown to the
Generals, however, was the second
semester eligibility of three of their
top swimmers, who had not shown up
on any earlier reports. Sophomore
captain Moose Herring said that
walking into the pool area was “‘like
walking into a bees’ nest.’ The
capacity crowd did not make things
any easier.

Bolstered by the fast times of the
three new team members, the Red
Raiders jumped to an early lead and

never looked back until they had set a
new pool record in the final event, the
400-yard freestyle relay. The men,
who had not competed since the vic-
tory over VMI on November 12, lost
100-75.

Remillard said that the Ship-
pensburg team ‘‘swam well, and our
swims were not great, but certainly
not bad.”’ He went on to say that the
times reflect well the stage of train-
ing the swimmers are currently in,
and he added that ‘‘at this time, our
mid-season times are faster than any
in history, and, except for a couple of
top times, faster than at the end of
the season last year.”’

As for the home contest against
theMaroons of Roanoke College, the
Generals forgot that a college basket-
ball game is 40 minutes long.

Surprise swimmers on W&L

On Saturday, the 25-meter pool at
Georgetown, in Washington D.C.,
was dominated by Washington and
Lee. The men raised their record to
3-1, defeating Frostburg State 68-40
and host Georgetown 65-43. Remil-
lard felt that the few problem swims
that occurred on Friday were cor-
rected in fine fashion by the mens’
team. The fact that both teams were
capable of ‘‘fewer surprises allowed
us to shuffle our line-up,’ he said,
and this allowed for experimentation
that “could prove valuable later’on.”’

Although the Women’s team, now

‘he Washington and Lee Wrestling
m had some anxious moments
» weekend. After travelling all the
y to Annville, Pa., the team was
ndly beaten in its first meet, but
ounded to take the consolation
cket and place fifth, thanks in
tito some last minute lineup shuf-
g.

‘his past weekend at the Lebanon
‘ley Tournament, W&L lost in the
t round 38-3 to Lycoming. The
m, however, came back to win the
t of its matches, thumping Baptist
le, 47-5, and edging Muhlenberg,
‘1, with an assist from some late
ching moves.

1 the finals of the consolation
nd against Muhlenberg, the
teh was tied at 15 with only the 177
the 190 lb., and the Heavyweight
ches to go.

Sophmore Rich Redfoot, who had
already won both his matches in the
previous rounds, faced Muhlenberg’s
Al Flowers in the 177 lb. match. Red-
foot pinned flowers in 2:18 to give the
Generals a 21-15 lead.

That’s when W&L head coach Gary
Franke began the maneuvering.

In wrestling the home team (in this
case Muhlenberg) must put its
wrestler on the mat first, and once
they do, they can’t withdraw him.
Since Muhlenberg had weighed two
wrestlers at 190 Ibs., the Generals
didn’t know’ which wrestler
Muhlenberg would show at 190 Ibs.

“We didn’t have a Heavyweight
with us on the trip,”’ said Franke.
This meant that W&L would have to
forfeit either the 190 Ib. match or the
heavyweight match.

“We waited until they [Muhlen-
berg] put their 190 pounder on the
mat,” said Franke. “We felt that

Muhlenberg was going with at heavy-
weight so we forfeited at 190 lbs.””

The forfeit tied the score at 21, but
Loupassi went on to beat
Muhlenberg’s Gary Franceschi 9-0 to
complete W&L’s 25-21 win that gave
them fifth place as the consolation
bracket winners.

But despite the exciting last match,
Franke felt that the team might have
lacked some emotion in the first

round loss to Lycoming.
“They [Lycoming] out-hustled
us,” said Franke. ‘Maybe we

weren’t prepared emotionally.”

“‘We were beaten badly in the team
score,” said Franke, “but the in-
dividual match scores were fairly
close.”’

As previously mentioned, Redfoot
was W&L’s lone winner in the
Lycoming match, beating Bryan
Neidigh 5-4. That match was tied at
the end of regulation time, but Red-
foot was awarded one point by virtue

of having a greater riding time than
Neidigh.

Franke said he the team ‘‘wrestled
better” in the second round, when
they demolished Baptist Bible 47-5.

This Saturday the Generals defend
their title in the W&L Invitaional
Tournament against Barber-Scotia,
Davidson, Elon, Longwood, Hamden-
Sydney, and Furman.

According to Franke, The Generals
will have no easy time of it on Satur-
day. ‘‘Due to graduation, I don’t
think that we have the depth we had
last year.”’ He said he feels that Elon
and Longwood are the teams to beat.

Additionally complicating matters
is the condition of Redfoot, the only
General to win all three of his match-
es last weekend at Lebanon Valley.
Redfoot did not practice on Wednes-
day because of the flu.

“Tf he’s not there it could make a
difference,” said Franke. ‘‘We’re
hoping he’ll be O.K. by the tourna-
ment.”

performance of the week-end.’ He
cited the personal best times of both
sophomore Nancy Whalen and fresh-
men Debbie Grove in the 400m
freestyle, as well as others. He also
mentioned that more ‘Top Five’
times were recorded this weekend
than ever before. The ‘Top Five,’ he
explained, is a list of the five fastest
times in all events swum by team
members this year. Getting onto the
list is the kind of incentive that keeps
many team members competitive,
even in workout.

Both teams travel again this
weekend, with both the men and

Coffland still awaiting a ruling from NCAA

 

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Assignments Editor

 

For William D. McHenry,
waiting game continues.

Washington and Lee’s director of
athletics still has not received a rul-
ing from the National Collegiate
Athletic Association on the eligibility
of football running back Chris Cof-
fland.

McHenry had hoped to hear from
the NCAA by Jan. 1.

The NCAA ruled Coffland ineligible
in November because he was not
registered for 12 credits during the
fall term.

Immediately following the surprise
ruling, McHenry asked all W&L
athletic coaches to make sure that
their athletes were taking 12

the

academic credits each term. Wrestl-
ing co-captain Jeff Mazza, a senior
from Bayshore, N.Y., was not allow-
ed to wrestle for W&L during fall
term because he was taking an
underload, McHenry said. Mazza is
now taking a full academic load and
has been wrestling all winter.

Mazza was the only other athlete
directly affected by the Coffland
decision, which was immediately ap-
pealed by W&L.

The dispute is a result of W&L’s
unusual academic calendar, which is
now being reviewed by the NCAA’s
Academic Requirements Committee,
McHenry said. Once that committee
is done, then the NCAA Eligibility
Committee may rule on Coffland’s
case.

W&L’s non-traditional academic
calender consists of two terms
lasting 12 weeks. The third lasts six.

Because of the calendar, W&L stu
dents take fewer credit-hours per
term than students at other schools.

NCAA bylaw 5-1-C requires that a
student-athlete be registered in a
minimum of 12 semester or quarter
hours, ‘‘or a similar minimum acade-
mic load as determined by the NCAA
Eligibility Committee in an institu-
tion that determines registration
other than on a traditional semester
or quarter-hour basis or conducts a
cooperative educational program.”’

A normal academic load at W&L is
12 to 14 credits, inclusive, per 12-
week term. Any amount below that is
considered an underload.

Coffland, a junior from Baltimore,
was registered for 10 credits. W&L
considered him a full-time student
because he was taking more than
nine credits. But the NCAA applied
its 12-hour requirement to his fall

i

term, making him ineligible

A 5’ 10’, 160 Ib. slotback, Coffland
was not allowed to play in W&L’s
final two games this season, although
a shoulder injury would have sidelin

ed him anyway, McHenry said
said

Coffland has been named a tri
captain of next year’s football squad
He is also a midfielder on W&L’s
lacrosse team

The ruling will not affect Coffland’s
lacrosse eligibility, but he could be
forced to sit out between two and
seven football games next year if the
appeal is denied, McHenry said

The Academic Requirements Com-
mittee’s decision is not expected to
affect W&L’s calendar, McHenry
said, but it could force W&L athletes

to take a Minimum number of credit

Shades on sports
by Mike Shady

Assistant Sports Editor

More W&L teams
means less play

I know a lot of guys who are extremely ticked off right now. Call ’em
“the Basketball Bunch.’’ I was a member of this elite, talented (ex-
cept for me), and yet somewhat undisciplined gang of hoopsters who
used to (notice the past tense) play in the old gym weekdays at around
3:30. Those games were sometimes awesome displays of running and
gunning, just ten fellas out having a whale of a good time. And then...

The Washington and Lee Athletic Department comes strolling by
and drops the big whammy on our “‘club.’”” Women’s volleyball, a
developmental varsity team, had decided to venture into our reign and
taken over control of the gym. Whoa, hold the phone. Women’s
volleyball???!!!! Hey, isn’t that something they show late night on
ESPN sandwiched between Speedweek and The Fishin’ Hole?

Well, it is. But the question isn’t whether or not W&L should field a
volleyball team, but rather what’s going to happen when women’s
athletics shifts into fifth gear. A nice advantage of coming to a small
liberal arts college is the availability of its sports facilities. Whenever
you needed a court, be it basketball, raquetball, tennis, or (ugh) even
squash (isn’t that a vegetable? ), one was almost right at hand.

But no more. Coeducation has ushered in a new era. Cross country,
swimming, and tennis have already been established as varsity
sports, and soccer, volleyball and basektball are not far behind. I
shudder just thinking about how difficult it will be to find court time
with two basketball teams instead of just one.

But what do we do? Unfortunately, the women will probably take
much of the blame. ‘‘We are concerned that the women are going to
have to bear most of the complaints,” said Assistant Athletic Director
Cinda Rankin.

You can scream, bitch, and moan about the women taking over and
receiving special treatment, but this just ain’t so. Women’s sports are
an inevitable and extremely nice addition to the W&L mainstream. So,
we recreational players will have to wait just that little bit longer for
the facilities. Big deal. In this case, the plusses far outweigh the
minusses.

So goodbye, Basketball Bunch. See ya later, Jim, Kev, Ron, Ski,
Dave, Jeff and whoever I forgot. Thanks for the good times, and
maybe we'll do it again next year.

Phi’s first choice

 

y ACKETT
Staff Reporter

 

Sophomore Richard Redfoot,
Washington and Lee’s 177 Ib.
wrestler, has been selected as the
first Ring-tum Phi W&L Athiete of
the Week for his performance in
quadrangular and dual meets this
past week.

Redfoot went through both
meets with a record of 6-0 pinning
one of his opponents, receiving a
technical decision against another
and defeating the others on points,
an effort definitely deserving
praise.

He is 9-2 for the season with one
of his losses coming at the hands
of a preseason all-America can-
didate and the other by a wrestler
whom he defeated earlier but
later lost to because of an injured
knee that hampered his perfor-
mance.

Redfoot

Redfoot said that he feels confi-
dent this season and hopes he can
make it to the national finals in
March.

He also has high hopes for the
team, which is currently 5-2.

“We had injuries early in the
season that hurt us,’’ said Red-
foot, “‘but now everyone is healthy
and the whole team should be in
good shape for the regional
finals.”’

The regionals will be held at
Washington and Lee the weekend
of February 20-22.

When he isn’t wrestling Redfoot
looks after his ferrets, Meegan
and McKinsey.

Redfoot is from Cocharnton,
Pa., where he wrestled, played
football, and volleyball for
Cocharton High School.

 

 

Indoor track to begin this weekend

 

By JIM LAKE

The 1987 Washington and Lee in-
door track team will open its season
this weekend at the Virginia Tech In-
vitational. According to head coach
Norris Aldridge, the Generals will be
represented by seven athletes in the
meet, with the rest of the squad
waiting until next weekend to begin
competition in pursuit of W&L’s
eleventh consecutive winning season
in indoor track.

This year’s team will feature five
former Old Dominion Conference
champions, ineluding senior John

hurdles. Senior Kevin Weaver was on
last year’s conference championship

Steilberg, White, and Weaver are
also former conference champions in
their respective events in outdoor
track, with White holding school
records in both the 110 and 400 meter
hurdles.

Aldridge says that the Generals will
have five athletes competing in the
pole vault, including Steilberg, senior
John Cardner, and juniors Joseph
Fisher and Robert Williamson. The
shot put will feature two excellent
throwers, Murray and sophomore
James Ambrosini. Sophomore Fray
McCormick will compete in the high
jump, and Burlingame, Andrew
White, and junior John White will
represent W&L in the long jump. The
triple jump will feature junior Nor-
man Sigler.

The Generals should also be strong
in the distance events, with junior
Richard Moore returning as the
team’s top distance runner. Sopho-

more Jamie Urso, who won a gold
medal in last year’s outdoor cham-
pionship meet, will compete in the
800 meter run. Moore, seniors Ash
Andrews and Steven Pockrass, and
junior Scott Rippeon will represent
the Generals in the 1500 and 5000
meter runs.

Aldridge says that last year’s
squad ‘“‘might have been the best
team I’ve ever had.’’ Although he
says that the nucleus of that team re-
mains, depth may be a problem for
the Generals in some events, in-
cluding the sprints and hurdles and
some field events.

The Generals’ head coach says that
he plans to enter all his athletes in
next Saturday’s VMI Relays.

‘American Tail’ triumphs;
‘Golden Child’ tarnished

BOMB A waste of Time and Money.

If you are a doubter of magic, An
American Tail will make you a
believer. Not because it is about
magic, but because it will take you
back to your childhood; back to the
times when you laughed at Pin-
nochio, you worried about Uncle
Remus, and you cried for Old Yeller
Steven Spielberg has once again cap-
tured that same magic that grabbed
us as children and refused to let us
g0. That Disney magic.

An American Tail opens in 1885
Shostka, Russia, as Fievel
Mouskawitz and his family talk idly
about the possibilities of making it in
the United States. When their village
is destroyed by the Cossacks, their
dreams turn into neccessity. The
family travels to Hamburg where
they find a ship heading to the United
States. Quickly they board and set off

turns to sorrow quickly though
Feivel, always curious and in awe of
all the world’s surprises is knocked of
the ship by a giant wave while trying
to see all the big fish in the ocean. By
chance, Feivel floats in an empty bot-
tle to the shore of Ellis Island where
he is befriended by Henre, the
French bird that built the Statue of
Liberty. Henre advises Feivel to
“never say never’’ and assures him
that he will find his parents.

The film progresses through a
series of mishaps with Feivel just
missing his parents in three or four
occurences. Not until he inadvertent
ly meets Tiger, a vegetarian feline
(Dom DeLuise’s voice) is he able to
be reunited with his family. Alright.
Yes, this movie is totally animated
and has Disney trademarks such as
an active score full of singing
animals, characters that believe only
in love and hope, and a happy ending.
For those of you that think you are
too old to go to a movie like this,
you're wrong. It is very entertaining
and a lot of fun. Dom DeLuise does a
wonderful job as Tiger, the cat with
the Cowardly Lion complex (i.e. Bert
Lahr). Likewise, Phillip Glasser
gives Fievel the life and sensitivity
that makes you automatically love
him the first time you see him.

While Feivel and Tiger are not like-
ly to get Oscar nominations, this film
will not be left out altogether. The

theme of An American Tail, called
“Somewhere Out There,” is reminis-

cent of the Disney classic ‘‘When You

received from the Golden Globes

Big Audio Dynamite is baad >

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Entertainment Editor

 

Big Audio Dynamite is two parts
hip-hop, three parts rock and roll,
four parts imagination and about six
parts brilliant. Our something like
that.

Big Audio Dynamite is Mick Jones’
Medicine Show: a Rock n’ Rap
Review where Eddie Cochran rubs
elbows with Run D.M.C. and the
Clash share a smoke with Prince. It’s
a place where politics bounce off
beatboxes and guitars accentuate the
positive.

When Mick Jones was kicked out of
the Clash, he certainly didn’t wait
around for his unemployment check.
With B.A.D., Jones takes the dub and
reggae experiments the Clash toyed
with on “Sandinista!’’ and pushes
them to their logical limit.

Big Audio Dynamite is the greatest
thing that has eveer happened to
drum a linn drum machine.

On “No. 10, Upping St.,’’ B.A.D’s
second platter, Jones brings in old
Clash buddy Joe Strummer to write
and produce. The result is a B.A.D.
record twice as bad as the only as
good as the melody, where the
melody is only as good as the
message

Strummer and Jones team up on
two of the record’s most melodic,
evocative tracks, ‘Beyond the Pale”’
and “V. Thirteen.”’ Both tracks are

driven by a_ light, understated

poignant lyrical detail that has been
missing from most of Jones’ recent
work. ‘‘Beyond the Pale’’ is one of the
best things to come out of the
Strummer-Jones camp in many a
new moon. The song’s narrator is a
young punk from ‘‘the dark side of
London/& that’s way beyond the
pale.’’ He recounts how bad his living
conditions are, determined to get his
message through before the cold
winter sets in. He cries indignantly:
“Don’t anybody know that/This city
was made Of immigrant blood and
money?”’ It is a touching moment on
an altogether powerful record.

“V. Thirteen’’ is is an apocalyptic
rap anthem accentuated by B.A.D.
soundman Don Letts’ recording of a
radio evangalist sermon to ‘‘Sodom
and Gomorrah.” In answer to the
preacher, Jones shouts triumphant-
ly, “Sodom & Gomorrah! Let the
D.J. play!/Cos I’m only gone tom-
morrow and here today...”’

But these aren’t the only two tunes
on ‘“‘No. 10, Upping St.” There’s the
brilliant “‘ C’mon Every Beatbox,”
where Jones and Letts trade off lines
over a punishing rhythm track set to
the tune of Eddie Cochran’s ‘“‘Sum-
mertime Blues.’’ ‘“‘Don’t worry ‘bout
the power, we got a generator,”
Jones sings; to which Letts answers,
“Batteries for rent, you can pay us
later.”

Other tracks are more stridently

political. With the possible exception
of Easterhouse, Big Audio Dynamite
is the most intelligent, perceptive
political pop group on earth planet.
On last year’s ‘‘Medicine Show,”
Jones used snakeskin oil as a
metaphor for a modern day cure-all,
singing prophetically, ‘“‘And I read in
the Middle East/How they traded
some for a hostage release.’’ On the
new record, B.A.D. is no less percep-
tive. ‘Ticket,’ sung brilliantly by
Letts, is the new album’s best polical
number. In one broad, ironic stroke,
Letts uses a ticket as a symbol of
unemployment, street crime,
violence at sporting events, and drug
trafficing. You’ve got to hear it to
understand it. The song’s melodic
and rhytmic hook is guaranteed to
bounce around in your head for at
Jeast a week straight.

“Limbo the Law’ and ‘“Sightsee
M.C.” are the most pure examples of
B.A.D.’s mixture of rock and rap to
be found on the new record, while
“Dial A Hitman”’ is the funniest, hip-
pest indictment of America’s Ram-
boerminator mentality that I’ve yet
heard. Here’s a sample lyric from
the “Dial a Hitman:”’ ‘“‘Yeh! Soldiers
of Fortune/But we’re not mental
giants/But mister I must tell you
Neither are our clients.”

“No. 10, Upping St.’’ is the real
thing: rock n’ roll to exalt over, cause
for celebration. It could change the
way you dance, change the way you
think, might even change the way
you bathe.
