Jackson calls for
voter participation

‘

 

For about 40 minutes early
‘Wednesday afternoon, the Rev. Jesse
Jackson spoke at Washington and
Lee about farms, factories and the
"future.

, Then he had some fun playing

“Jesse Says.”

* An ordained Baptist minister,
»Jackson seemed to be doing more
than speaking Wednesday.
* Appearing before a massive front-
slawn audience estimated at 2,500, the
45-year-old potential presidential
"candidate asked that those who knew
«of someone who had died of drug use
to raise their hands. A few did.

When he asked how many knew
“someone who was in jail because of
drugs, many hands went up, and
when he asked how many knew
«someone who had used drugs, almost
every hand was raised.

In an interview after the speech,
«Jackson called drugs ‘‘the number
one threat to this generation of
youth.”

+ Before answering audience ques-
,tions, Jackson called on those who
wer 18 but not yet registered voters to
‘raise their hands. ‘Everyone with
,their hands up, come down here right
now,” Jackson said, and students

Tennis takes second

For the entire Division lili men’s
‘tennis season, Kalamazoo was rank-
red No. 1 with Washington and Lee
,ranked No. 2.

Yesterday in Salisbury, Md., those
*rankings proved to be prophetic as
,Kalamazoo defeated’ the
Generals, , in the National Col-
‘legiate Athletic Association D-III na-
, tional championship finals.

It is the second consecutive year
"that W&L has finished in second
«place and the fourth time in 13 years.

, Three tiebreakers in the singles
decided the match for W&L. Alex
‘Palladino (ITCA No. 3) downed

Generals in the singles matches

reluctantly began to file down the
grassy hill toward Lee Chapel. Soon,
a large throng of 100 or more students
was gathering in front of Jackson.

“It’s getting crowded but that’s all
right,”’ said Jackson, who ran unsuc-
cessfully for the Democratic nomina-
tion in 1984. Making light of the name
“mock convention,” he called the
unregistered students ‘mock Amer-
icans.”’ Jackson then asked the
others in the audience to give those
students a round of applause for be-
ing honest about not being regis-
tered. It’s not often that Jackson
calls for applause for non-registered
voters.

Jackson’s speech was the kickoff
for the upcoming 1988 Mock Demo-
cratic Convention, which will be held
on March 25 and 26. Jackson is “the
most controversial person we could
bring to speak,’’ said Mare L. Gor-
don, a junior from Columbia,
Missouri, who arranged the visit.
Gordon is speakers and protocol
chairman for the convention.

The main focus of the speech was
on the broad themes Jackson tends to
stress—economic recovery, human
rights, equal rights and _ voter
registration.

“Economic justice, economic com-
monground, will heal our wounds and
make us strong again,” Jackson
said. “There must be profound eco-

Junior McLeod couldn’t handle Jack

duced a situation in which the
Generals would have to grab at least
one of the three remaining sigles
matches if they wanted to have a
chance.

All three went the distance of three
sets and it was the tiebreaker that
turned out to be W&L’s worst enemy.
Senior captain Roby Mize lost a
heartbreaker at No. 4, 6-3 3-6 7-6 to
Rick Verheul, and Jim Hufler slipped
by junior Chris Wiman, 7-6 1-6 6-4 at
No. 5. Finally, Dave Borski defeated
freshman John Morris, 7-6 5-7 6-3, to
close out the match before the
doubles portion could even get under
way. On the day, the Generals’
record in tiebreakers was 1-3.

From Staff Reports

 

Washington and Lee University
has begun an effort to build a com-
* prehensive center for the performing
arts on its campus. Once completed,
the facility will serve as the
« Lexington-Rockbridge area's only
center for the performance of drama,
music, and dance.

* Construction on the $9 million
, facility will begin in the spring of

1988, if sufficient funding is secured
* by that time, with completion sched-
, uled for 1990. To date, $4 million has

been contributed for the center by
* alumni, foundations and corpora-
tions.

“The new center for the perform-
ing arts speaks to the educational

Huntley Pavilion on Thursday even-
ing. Security personnel outnumbered
patrons until around 11:30. Eventual-
ly about 30 people showed up to see
the Limit and Skip Castro. The low
attendance was blamed on poor ad-
vertising and the fact that there had
to be a beer garden.

Said IFC vice president George
Early, “Thursday night was pretty
much of a flop.”

‘*No one bothered to go out,’’ added
former IFC president Chris Saxman.
“‘T was kind of let down by the frater-
nities. All that hard work and no one
sh »wed up.”

Yet Saxman believes that this
year’s Greek Week was a good begin-
ning. ‘I think we've set a nice base.
There was enthusiasm in all of the
activities and everyone had fun.
We'll learn from our mistakes and go
from there.”’

said John D. Wilson, president of
Washington and Lee, in announcing
the project. ‘Music, drama, and
dance play significant roles already
in the university's educational pro-
gram and in its service to the wider
Lexington-Rockbridge community.
The new center will simply improve
and expand our offering.”’

The need for a comprehensive
facility to house the performing arts
at Washington and Lee is well-
documented. For more than 50 years,
the program has been housed in a
mid-19th century structure — the
Troubadour Theatre on Henry Street

that is beyond renovation or ex-
pansion.

The Rev. Jesse Jackson, at least
temporarily the Democratic
front-runner for the presidency,
said Wednesday that he.regretted
what had happened to Gary Hart,
who bowed out of the campaign
last week amid questions of his
fidelity.

But he also said that Hart’s
decision would not influence his
campaign in any way. He said
that although Hart may be behind
us, his ideas remain with us.

cessively as shoe factory, roller rink,
dance hall, pool hall, and hardware
store. It was acquired by the univer-
sity in 1929 and turned into a theatre
workshop. In 1935, various improve-
ments were made and the former
shoe factory became the Washington
and Lee Troubadour Theatre. The
W&L fine arts department also uses
the Boiler Room Theatre in the base-
ment of the Old Main Street Shopping
Mall to present experimental
theatreworks.

As early as 1964, the trustees, ad-
ministration, and faculty recognized
the need for a center for the perfor-
mrng arts. Yet, it was only after the
renovation of practically every
building on campus and the construc-
tion of a new undergraduate library,
law school building, gymnasium, and

residence hall that attention could be
turned to the need for a theatre. All of
the university’s National Historic
Landmark buildings have been com-
pletely renovated and returned to ac-
tive use.

The center for the performing arts
will be located diagonally across
Nelson Street from Gaines Hall, the
new student residence currently
under construction,

The center will stand in the middle
of a landscaped parking area and en-
try plaza. The design motif achieved
by Gaines Hall will be carried across
the Nelson Street intersection to the

form of a gatehouse tower. In tandem
with Gaines, the center for the per

Women’s
sponsors

By STACY MORRISON
Staff Reporter

 

 

Organizers of the upcoming Confet-
tis weekend are estimating that the
event will cost approximately $6,500.

“The cost all depends on how many
people go,” said Liz Smith, one of
three social chairwomen of the
Women’s Forum, which is sponsor-
ing Confettis.

Revenue for the event, which will
take place this weekend, will come
primarily from ticket and T-shirt
sales. Anne Schroer, associate dean
of students and adviser to the
Women’s Forum, expects ticket sales
to generate about $6,000.

The cost of food is a big variable in
estimating the budget of Confettis,
because the formal’s organizers will
not order food until they know how
many people are attending. The two
bands, Heinsohn and Day and The
Connells, cost $1,900, and the rental
of Zollman’s Pavilion adds $200.

The Executive Committee gave
$125 to Confettis to defray printing
costs for the invitations, Smith said.
The dean of students office is paying
for the speaker at the Friday night
banquet, said Schroer.

The speaker will be Sybil Todd,
associate dean of students at the
University of Virginia.

“Mr. Darrell helped us with food
for the banquet on Friday and the
brunch on Sunday because of the

The center’s gatehouse tower will
be located astride the old railroad
trestle, which will become a brick-
covered footbridge to the campus.
The old Lexington train station adja-
cent to the new theatre site will be
associated with the theatre plans.
Visitors to the center will have ac-
cess to the upper and lower levels of
the building through the gatehouse,
entering an aluminum and glass
vestibule that opens into the main
lobby.

The main theatre in the center will
seat 425 in comfort, and the rise is

ded.

Although Confettis is being spon-
sored by the Women’s Forum, Smith
pointed out that all women under-
graduate students may attend. “It
isn’t limited to just the women who
have been working with the Women’s
Forum.’

“The whole thing is in response to
the women not having anything that
they could do together as an organiz-
ed group,”’ Smith continued. ‘‘We are
trying to pull the undergraduate
women together.

Schroer sees Confettis as ‘‘a
chance for the women to reciprocate.
Everything of a party nature at W&L
has been centered around the frater-

Getting
together

There is a new feature in The Ring-tum Phi, called “‘From
the Hill,’ in which issues pertinent to Washington and Lee
University are discussed weekly by different members of the
administration. The Phi is glad President John D. Wilson is
inaugurating the column this week.

“From the Hill” is another step that has been taken to im-
prove relations between the administration and the student
body. Tightening the lines between the groups will improve
the implementation of university programs and student sat-
isfaction with the school.

Another important aspect of the new effort in communica-
tion is the Executive Committee’s new forums discussing
issues the student body considers important. Administration
members are there to answer questions and listen to student
concerns. This gives a chance for close interaction between
students and the Hill, and also provides more immediate
ansers to the questions of both groups.

Although the first EC forum, which concerned the universi-
ty’s plans to build a new theater, was rather poorly attended,
attendance at last Monday’s meeting was higher. Director of
Admissions William M. Hartog was there to help the student
body better understand admissions policy.

Students need to make sure they keep the interest in the
forum alive. The administration has made the first move by
agreeing to send representatives to the meetings; the
students must reciprocate and attend the meetings. Other-
wise student-administration relations will continue to be
broken down by misunderstandings and lack of communica-
tion.

If students do not take the time to voice their opinions about
matters relevant to the university, then they should not
bother to complain at all. The opinion page of the Phi and the
EC forums are not the only avenues open to students; writing
of calling administrators or faculty can often make a dif-
ference, but only if enough students become involved in cam-
pus life. Until that happens, nothing will ever be changed.

Wrap up

Editor recalls ‘achievements’ of past year

 

FINAL VIEW
By Sean Bugg

As the term begins to wind down
and summer vacation approaches, I
think it is a good time to look back
and take note of some of the things
that made the year memorable, lest
we forget all that was done both
publicly and behind our backs.

First, I would like to congratulate
the freshmen on their apparently
never-ending drive to surpass
academically all previous classes at
Washington and Lee. Although stu-
dent organizations and activities will
suffer from their apathy, at least
their grades will be high.

Director of Admissions William M.
Hartog gets the ‘‘Cockiness Will Get
You Anywhere” award for the year.

Not only were W&L students surpris-

ed to hear they were underachievers
if they made a C or D in school, they
also learned one minority student
was accepted with SATs under 1,000.
while ‘‘two young men whose SATs
are below 1,000 [were] rejected
because they can’t do the work,”’ ac-
cording to the admissions story in the
Roanoke Times and World News. The
admissions office gets a special gold
star for consistency in standards.

It is hard to decide who should win
an award for the hardest work on a
dead issue. Should it go to the
students who organized a protest
against the change from Coke to Pep-
si, or Rick Robins and his petition to
repeal coeducation? I think it is a tie.
Actually, just seeing students get in-
volved at W&L is enough of a treat; I
think I may be asking too much of
them to become involved in issues
they can actually do something

about.

University Registrar D. Scott Ditt-
man deserves special mention for his
let’s-try-to-be-like-everyone-else at-
titude. Being the unique university
that it is, W&L needs a better excuse
to install a new computer registra-
tion system than the ‘‘fact’’ that
other universities do it that way.
While the old, and now resurrected
system has its problems, at least
students did not have to pull all-
nighters in the library to get into
classes they wanted.

The most flawed logic of the year
has come from students who have
said fg¢ke I.D.s should not be honor
violations because people using them
do not believe the law should prohibit
them from drinking. I’ll remember
that logic the next time I want a new
tape, and I’ll just pick it out of the
Bookstore without paying. I mean, I
certainly think Virginia’s shoplifting

laws are completely bogus. Or ma;
be I could just go to Roanoke, where
will not be “‘easily identifiable as
Washington and Lee student.” It ‘
good to know so many people hav
coats of honor that can be taken off a
the situation demands.

And who can forget the administra
tion’s apparent decision that a Ph.D
is a better measure of a professor’:
value than the ability to teach. While
a Ph.D. is certainly of value, W&:
should concentrate on building
talented faculty that cares for its
students, and not a faculty that looks
good only in admissions brochures.

No one should forget the mistakes
that have been made this year, for
much can be learned from them. One
can only hope that fewer mistakes
will be made in the future and tha?
students, faculty and administration
will learn to cooperate in an effort to
make W&L better than before.

What’s the big deal with Gary Hart?

 

MY VIEW
By Jennifer Spreng

 

Gary Hart’s withdrawal from the
Presidental elections is a larger
bummer for the United States than
one might think.

No one will ever know if he would
have been a good President. My
suspicion is that he would have been,
but that doesn’t really matter now.

What is most bothersome is that I
can’t see that Gary Hart did anything
wrong! I certainly don’t see anything
that should have made him so
undesirable to the voting public.

Gary Hart’s “crimes’’ certainly
weren’t unprecedented in US.
political history, nor were they par-
ticularly abnormal behaviors in
modern society.

Take for instance, his name change
from ‘‘Hartpence”’ to “‘Hart.”’

Com’on, be reasonable. Would you
have entered politics with a last
name like ‘‘Hartpence?”’ Face it, it’s
lousy for slogans and more likely to
turn off voters than endear them.

Besides, people change their
names all the time these days. Be-
tween divorce, remarriage, and the

high proportion of female-headed
families, names don’t have quite the
same meaning as they used to. Many
are little more than legal tools and
simple means of identification. If
Gary Hart thought that ‘‘Hart’’
would satisfy those needs better than
“Hartpence,’’ why condemn him for
action he took long ago? I’m impress-
ed that he was so practical.

This age business is silly, too.
There isn’t really any question that
he is old enough to hold the Presiden-
cy, so what’s the problem?

Even a personage as illustrious as
Alexander Hamilton sluffed over his
age numerous times. One of the
delegates to the Constitutional Con-
vention falsified his age so that he
could appear to be the youngest
delegate.

Those are just drops-in-the-bucket
compared with his sexual indiscre-
tions, I guess, though I fail to see why
they should hurt his political chances
so badly. Gary Hart certainly was no
saint, but he was no more of a
bedroom athlete than past Presi-
dents have been.

Thomas Jefferson, Franklin
Roosevelt and John Kennedy all have
dubious reputations in this area, yet
each is arguably among a list of our
best Presidents.

Hart’s family situation may be
unstable, but Ronald Reagan himself
hasn’t had the most conventional

family life either. After all, he’s a
divorced man (shocking!), and his
children have been publicly rebel-
lious and disgruntled with him.

No one could fault Hart’s domestic
situation as being overly abnormal
for the times. Family life is chang-
ing; why do we expect that our
Presidential candidates’ private
lives should not have changed since
the 1950s?

Besides, what does any of this have
to do with Hart’s ability to be Presi-
dent? Do archaic ideas about morali-
ty and appearances play a bigger
role in picking candidates than
merit?

If so, that is the sad commentary
on American politics apparent from
the Hart disaster.

It’s to be expected that all of the
above issues would have influenced
the eventual vote. Hart had to expect
that, because all together they do
make an interesting commentary on
his character. The shame is that they
played such a huge role so quickly.

It’s a depressing small-mindedness
that will cause enough people to
abandon a candidate for such trivial
surface indiscretions before hearing
his ideas so that even running for the
office becomes futile.

Americans must have been hope-
lessly brainwashed somewhere along
the way if they so easily allow

‘No students checks’ upsets law student |

themselves to fall prey to such ob-
vious abuse of appearances.

The way the press trailed Gary
Hart, and then exposed him as
though they were bounty hunters is a
tad hypocritical as well. After all;
aicn’t they the ones who repeatedly,
complain that President Reagan
plays to appearances instead -
speaking honestly?

The whole situation justreeks’

I thought these attitudes had
changed since Senator Thomas
Eagleton was so senselessly abused
while he was on George McGovern’s
ticket in 1972. I’m very sorry to see
that I was wrong.

American intolerance with Sen.
Eagleton’s minor psychiatric treat-
ment many years before his vice;
presidential candidacy is very
similar to its intolerance with Gary
Hart today.

In both cases, the straws that broke
the candidates’ bucks had very little
to do with their abilities to serve in
their respective offices. What a
waste of good political and leader-
ship talent! Not many really outstan-
ding and qualified potential Presi-
dents are running around these days.
I don’t agree with many of his ideas;
but I really thought that Gary Hart,
was a good prospect.

I’m really disappointed that he’s no
longer a candidate for President. —

To the Editors:

The signs are up again, all over town: ‘‘No Stu-
dent Checks Accepted after May 1.”’ I take those
signs as a personal insult, but I cannot blame the
merchants. My fellow students, past and pre-
sent, are to blame for the shameful reputation
we all have around town for passing cold checks.
Our graduating seniors are the worst culprits,
for many of them apparently feel free to write
worthless check after worthless check, knowing
that they’ll be out of reach of the Cold Check
Committee by the time their checks come back.

When a bank returns a check for insufficient
funds, it is said to have ‘‘dishonored”’ the check.
That should ring a bell in the heads of students
who claim to live by an Honor System. When we
write cold checks, we dishonor ourselves and our
University.

We brag that one benefit of our Honor System
is that students’ checks are accepted all over
town. That boast is patently false. The Honor
System does not shut down on May 1. We can
write checks all over town because the Cold
Check Committee baby-sits us and makes good
when we lie about how much money we have in
our accounts. That’s what we’re doing, by the
way, when we pass a cold check. And it’s not a
little white lie. It’s a felony. Maybe some of us
don’t realize the seriousness of that, because
Dad has always been around to cover for us. But
if we want to be treated as adults here, we’ve got
to start being responsible for ourselves.

We’ve all bounced a check or two through sim-
ple carelessness, but carelessness is not a very
good excuse. Everybody’s checkbook has a place
for keeping a record of how much money is in the
account. If you can subtract, you have no reason
to pass a cold check. If your account is empty,
but you get paid soon, wait till you get paid. It’s
not so hard to wait till you have money before
you spend it. Be a grownup.

The solution to this problem is really very sim-
ple; it’s what would make the Honor System
work, if it did. All we have to do is to start being
honest and responsible. If our Honor System
really worked, that is, if we all lived by it, in-
stead of in fear of it (or in spite of it), we wouldn’t
need a Cold Check Committee. Since that’s ap-
parently not the case, we need to take stern
measures to save our reputation — our honor.
The Executive Committee should immediately
instruct the Cold Check Committee that students
passing cold checks be fined a minimum of $50,
in all but the most trivial or exceptional cases,
and that any student passing a second cold check
in a given academic year be reported to the Ex-
ecutive Committee for a potential honor viola-
tion. The Executive Committee should announce

 

 

to the student body that the deliberate or wanton

(i.e., grossly careless) passing of cold checks is.

both a misrepresentation and a theft, and that
students found guilty of deliberately or wantonly
passing cold checks will be expelled from the
University. Finally, the Executive Committee
should confer with the Board of Trustees as to
remedies against graduating students who pass
cold checks at the end of their last semester. The
remedy that comes most readily to mind is the
withdrawal of such a student’s diploma, retrac-
tion of any letters of recommendation or of good
character, and the threat of legal action against

any such former student who represents himself

as a graduate of Washington and Lee. These

ideas may seem harsh, but our honor is at stake,

in the most basic sense of the word. If we are to
save it, we must prove to the merchants of Lex-
ington and to the thieves and liars among us that

we mean what we say, when we claim to live by a
code of Honor.

far, the convention was indeed a success. With-
out all of the help we received, from the Presi-

ticipate in musical groups.

Although I have at times felt very alone here, I want to thank my
friends (‘‘Pockrass has friends?’’) for giving a damn about me. I once
wrote in a ‘My View” column that “real friends and lovers are not
necessarily the people who are willing to party with you or even go to
bed with you. They are the people who talk to you openly, who listen
with a caring ear, who read what you’ve written just because it’s
yours, who cheer you when you’re down and compliment you when

-

you're up.”

I believe that, and I thank the people who have been real friends, my
| parents included. I thank the people who have been open-minded
enough to accept my religious beliefs, even if my faith differs from
{| most at this conservative, Christian school.

| So go to the bar and pour yourself a tall cold one. For all you do, ce

lait est pour vous.

Along with “please” and ‘‘condoms,”’ ‘‘thank you”’ is one of those
magical expressions that make life a little nicer. It’s an almost
mystical experience to go to the drugstore and say, ‘Condoms please.

But since everyone is writing about condoms, and ‘‘please”’ is a
more of a beginning-of-the-year word, it seems fitting to say “thank
you”’ in May to those who have helped brighten one’s college years.

To cite people by name would be inappropriate. To include the name
of one person in a column limited by space is to exclude another. When

Judging from the response I received to last week’s Lexicon, it
seems that some people think I am opposed to the IFC’s giving money
to charity through Greek Week. Not at all. But I think we as a school
ought to thank the people who serve on the various committees and

. organizations that keep W&L functioning. We must thank those who

‘represent our school in the community. That includes the athletes and
musical performers who serve as ambassadors of this university.

Personally, I would like to thank those who gave me a chance to par-

Another difficulty Danford and his
staff face is deciding what con-

Danford also said that some

W&L junior makes
visit to Mayflower

From Staff Reports

When Washington and Lee junior
Roger Hildreth celebrated his 2ist
birthday several weeks ago, he
thought he would be without a cake.

“My mom had told me that since
her oven was broken she couldn't
bake a cake for me,”’ he explains.

But Hildreth did get his cake. He
even got a party—although it was not
exactly the sort of celebration
customarily associated with 2ist
birthdays. In this case, the party was
thrown for Hildreth by residents of
the Mayflower, a retirement facility
in Lexington.

Since last fall Hildreth and a band
of fellow W&L students have been
paying regular visits to the May-
flower residents purely on a volun-
teer basis.

“This has been the most successful
volunteer program we've ever had,”
says Kathleen Rogers, the May-
flower’s administrator. ‘“‘And Roger
has been our most faithful volun-
teer.”’

Entirely on his own _ initiative,
Hildreth established the program at
the beginning of the 1986-87 academic
year.

right to vote chose not to, Jackson
said. ‘You can make a difference.”

He said he knew life could be dif-
ficult for college students. ‘‘At a time
when your sunshine should be bril-
liant, your sun has been eclipsed,”
Jackson said on the cool, gray,
almost misty afternoon. ‘‘Hold on,
morning comes.,”’

As he said this, the wind whipped
up, and the Virginia flag on Jack-
son’s left and the American flag on
his right began waving.

The crowd was made up mostly of
white W&L students, faculty
members and administrators,
although townspeople and Virginia
Military Institute cadets also were
there. W&L classes were abbreviated
to allow students to attend the
speech.

When asked what he thought of
blacks who joined the Republican
Party, Jackson said’ that what was
most important to him was that
everyone registered and voted.

But he also added, ‘The
Democratic Party has the most to of-
fer. I have the ability and the will to
do more for you than any Republican
alive.”

the U.S. derived any benefit from
giving aid to a Marxist country was
applauded by the audience. Jackson

Editor's note — The Phi takes
pride in providing a forum for stu-
dent opinion. In an effort to inform
students of the opinions of the ad-
ministration and faculty, the Phi is
sponsoring columns written by
members of the administration and
faculty. We welcome responses from
students.

I very much appreciate the in-
itiatives of the editors of the Phi to
help create new ways for
members of the University to
communicate with each other
about things that matter. Of
course, the letters-to-the-editor
column has always been open and
it has an important role to play. So
do straight news stories and
editorials. But I especially thank
you for creating a new column to
which various members of the
Faculty and administrative staff
can contribute each week over the
course of the year.

I will help to inaugurate this ef-
fort by sharing with you some
general thoughts about the nature
of change and continuity at
Washington and Lee. Change has
been on everyone’s mind lately
and no wonder: there have been
many alterations in our lives over
the past few years, some caused
by forces outside the University
and some initiated within. But
regardless of origin, we have all
had to absorb a great deal of
change and our response, beyond
weariness and the desire for
stability, has partly been shaped
by fear — fear that in the plethora
of new rules, new programs, new
requirements and new people, the
essence of the real Washington
and Lee will be weakened or lost.

 

nizations for a long time,” says
Hildreth, explaining his motives.
“We come into this town for four
years and then we're gone. There is
often a lot of friction between the
W&L students and the townspeople,
and I wanted to work against that.”

Hildreth is no stranger to such pro-
jects. During his high school years in
Bethesda, Md., he assisted with the
Special Olympics program, par-
ticipated in day-care facilities, and
worked with inner-city youth in the
Washington, D.C., area.

Hildreth was, then, a perfect can-
didate to form a service club at W&L.
In September he began to round up
members. Then he contacted the
Mayflower’s administrator to deter-
mine what volunteer work might be
done there to benefit the facility’s 25
residents.

Now each week he and several
other students take time from their
studies and other extracurricular ac-
tivities to spend time at the May-
flower. Sometimes they play bingo or
card games. Sometimes they simply
provide conversation. Hildreth has
even brought along an electronic
keyboard for some musical enter-
tainment. In December he and his
volunteers gave the Mayflower

residents a Christmas party and sang
“The residents

carols with them.

  

e

really ate that up,”’ he recalls.

Still in its initial stages, the pro-
gram has attracted only a few volun-
teers. Yet, Hildreth says, ‘‘as smail
as the program is, I think it is having
a big effect on the people there.”’

Hildreth’s effect on the residents
could hardly have been clearer when
they decided to celebrate his birth-
day.

health clinic.

But for now he will be content with
his weekly visits to the Mayflower. ‘‘I
think I really give the people there
something to look forward to each
week,” he says. “I find that very
heartwarming.”

Adds Rogers, the facility’s ad-
ministrator: “Roger Hildreth has
made a dreary winter much, much
brighter for our residents.”

And, in return, the Mayflower
residents helped make Roger Hil-
dreth’s 2ist birthday much brighter,
too.

said the question was whether the
U.S. wanted influence or isolation.
He said he was glad that Richard
Nixon saw beyond China’s com-
munist ideology and reopened com-
munications between the two na-
tions.

Jackson spent much of his time
cutting down the Reagan administra-
tion. He said the Iran/Contra scandal
could bring the White House down in

shame.

“Right now, our foreign policy is so
off-base,”’ Jackson said. “‘All these
hearings are pointing to the president
and the vice-president.”

When asked why he agreed to
speak at W&L, usually considered a
very conservative Southern school,
Jackson said that he was a South-
erner and had been impressed by be-
ing invited to W&L. He said he

 

Let us simply list a few of the
many things we have all had to ad-
just to in recent months:

(1) A revised ‘‘core curricu-
lum’’ compelling new students to
take undergraduate courses in
mathematics, English,  ex-
perimental science, literature and
foreign languages, the humanities
etc. This curricula change was ap-
proved by the Faculty early in
1983 but its consequences are only
now being worked out and faculty
positions are being allocated to
alleviate some of the enrollment
shifts it has caused.

(2) The determination by the
Faculty to increase the credit re-
quirements for the baccalaureate
degree from 115 to 121. This was
also approved some four years
ago, but everyone who entered
under the “old calendar’ was
grandfathered. Thus the conse-
quences, especially for spring
term enrollments, have only
recently begun to show up. The
practical effect has been to double
spring term enrollments and we
have been scrambling, with
uneven success, to adjust course
offerings to reflect this new fact.

(3) The shift in Virginia’s drink-
ing age from 18 to 21, with some
students in-between still eligible
to purchase and drink alcohol.
This has had a major impact upon
the way we conduct our social life.
ABC agents supervise every party
and I.D. checks are thorough and
persistent. University-sponsored
parties in the GHQ or in the
Pavilion are much more ‘‘closed”’
than they needed to be just a few
months ago.

(4) The dramatic escalation in
liability cases, especially in mat-
ters arising from illegal alcohol
consumption, has put a heavier-
than-ever burden upon the frater-
nities and upon the University.
The narrowing down of open par-
ties, with freely provided drink for
anyone who cared to come in the

IErom the Hill

Wilson reviews changes and continuities

front door, has been a most un-
popular change. Many see it as
jeopardizing the special spirit of
the University even though its
necessity is grudgingly conceded.
We all recognize that one lawsuit
could wreck the stability of a
given house and place its officers
in long-term jeopardy. Still, it
doesn’t mean we have to like this
new state of affairs or welcome it.

(5) The rise in our applications
for admission since the Board’s
policy change in 1984 has caused
much recent comment, especially
since the publication in a regional
paper (and the Phi) of a super-
ficial article on the admissions
evaluation process. Let me simply
say this: we do indeed now
receive more than twice the
number of applications received
in recent years. But they are
largely coming from the same
schools, the same cities, the same
families, including alumni fami-
lies, which we have counted upon
over the years. Look carefully at
the soccer and lacrosse teams, the
University Chorus, the Phi staff,
the pledges to our fraternities, the
radio station, the Troubadour ac-
tors and actresses. Freshmen and
sophomores are admirably taking
up accustomed places in our co-
curricular and extra-curricular
life. And they are holding their
own in academic courses too. It is
certainly true that with increased
applications for the same few
places, it is harder to gain a place
in the entering class. But the
evaluation criteria are now very
different from those applied in
1973 or 1983. I find it interesting in
this regard to note that freshmen
pledging fraternities has risen
from 62% in 1983 to nearly 80%
this last fall. And 80% is,
historically, the standard index to
Washington and Lee’s fraternity
system.

I could go on in this way to note
still further changes which have

thought it was unfair to label all W&L
students as being of one mindset.

“T’m nota liberal. I’m not a conser-
vative. I’m authentic. I’m genuine,”
Jackson said.

Jackson said the purpose of the
Rainbow Coalition Inc. was ‘‘to build
a new political consensus in this
country.”’ The coaltion is multi-
colored, multi-racial, multi-religious
and multi-talented, Jackson said.

recently come to us. The Fraterni-
ty ‘‘Renaissance’’ movement
spearheaded by the Alumni Fra-
ternity Council and the Board of
Trustees; the coeducation deci-
sion with inevitable alterations in
our perceived patterns of residen-
tial and social life; the advent of
new athletic teams and the place-
ment of men’s lacrosse in Division
III of the NCAA; the appointment
of new members of the Faculty
and administrative staff, espec-
ially the appointment of three new
academic deans and three new
colleagues in the Office of the
Dean of Students. The list seems
endless. And, alas, it will be added
to, especially as senior colleagues
reach retirement age and new,
younger associates come to take
up places here.

But there are continuities too
and these, I think, are far more
important. We are still deeply
committed to the Honor System
and the environment of trust and
decency it fosters. We are still
determined to look after each
other when help is needed. We still
depend for our very soul upon gen-
uine friendships that transcend
the classroom and the undergrad-
uate years. We are still capable of
taking great pride in the Universi-
ty’s academic standards without,
at the same time, taking ourselves
too seriously. And we still enjoy
the very highest level of alumni
loyalty and are much aided by the
generosity which annually comes
to us, unbidden (well, almost un-
bidden), from friends and founda-
tions as well as parents and alum-
ni. These things, I believe, carry
the promise of our future ex-
cellence even as they have
secured this University over all
the years of the past. I think they
will hold us in good stead as we
continue to adjust to other
changes in our corporate life. I
certainly hope so.

Renovations part of capital projects plan

 

 

By MARGARET PIMBLETT
Staff Reporter
The scaffolding around

Washington Hall recently was a hint
to the renovations being undertaken

on campus as part of a capital pro-
jects plan.

According to Frank Parsons, assis-
tant to the university president, the
chimneys of Washington Hall were
being repaired and ‘refurbished to
combat deterioration of the upper
portions.

that Hart’s dropping out would not
affect his strategy for the Sour-
thern primary or the overall cam-
paign.

He said the critical question
that women must ask as a result
of the Hart affair is what effect
this will have on female credibili-
ty

 

“The presumption is that the
woman does not have the strength
of mind or integrity to make good
judgments.”’ Such an attitude is
demeaning to women, Jackson
said. There already were too few
jobs for women in the campaigns,
and now there are even fewer.

“TI know so many women who

 

 

The capital projects budget in-
cludes funding for renovation efforts
requested by individual departments
or projects that the buildings and
grounds department identifies as
“the type of project that does not fall
under routine maintenance,”’ Par-
sons said.

An example of routine main-
tenance is the care of the statue of
“Old George’ on top of Washington
Hall. The statue was given a fresh
coat of paint recently.

Parsons said George usually re-
quires repainting once a year.
The funds for the capital projects

are bright and charming and
beautiful and tough,” Jackson
said.

This week’s issue of Time
magazine described the Demo-
cratic battlefield as ‘‘a mass of
political Silly Putty’ because of
Hart’s departure from the cam-
paign. ‘Of the seven, only
Jackson has an established na-
tional reputation—yet he has vir-
tually no chance of winning.”’

When asked in the interview
how he responds to such negative
commentary, Jackson simply re-
plied, ‘I don’t.”’

When asked by a student jour-
nalist is the Miami Herald was
justified in its treatment of Hart,
Jackson replied, ‘That is a ques-
tion you media people have to
resolve yourselves.”’

budget and for undesignated im-
provements to the physical campus
are derived from four sources, Par-
sons said.

Those sources are tuition and fees,
endowment, gifts, and profits from
auxiliary enterprises, such as the
Bookstore and Evans Dining Hall.

Some prospective capital projects
include the repair or replacement of
all the rain gutters along the Colon-
nade buildings, the renovation of

some of the handball courts in |
racquetball °
courts, and the improvement of cam- ,

Lax season
ends in 17-4

loss to Ohio

 

 

By DAVID EMRICH
Sports Editor

 

Last week, the Washington and Lee
lacrosse team turned the tables on
Roanoke—reversing a regular
season loss with a playoff win. This
week, the Ohio Wesleyan Bishops did
the same thing to the Generals,

The Bishops overturned an earlier
12-8 loss at the Generals’ hands with
a 17-4 victory in the semi-finals of the
National Collegiate Athletic Associa-
tion Division III lacrosse tourna-
ment.

“Ohio Wesleyan was a better team
this time,’’ said W&L head coach
Dennis Daly. ‘As their coach [W&L
graduate Mike Pressler] stated after
the game, we were the team that
caused them to reconsider what they
were doing by beating them as handi-
ly as we did (during the regular
season].

“They consolidated their personnel
from around 18 to 20 people down to
13 people playing in a game. They
became a stronger team by reducing
the number of people they were play-
ing.”

Ohio Wesleyan is located in the nor-
thern part of Ohio, about a nine-hour

bus ride from Lexington. The team
split the trip to Delaware, Ohio, leav-
ing Friday about 9 p.m. and stopping
halfway before completing the trip
on Saturday afternoon.

As soon as the members of the
team arrived at their Ohio hotel, they
got changed and held a short prac-
tice. Then it was back to the hotel to
eat dinner and relax before the next
day’s game.

The next morning they ate a buffet
breakfast and watched highlights of
the last two games against Roanoke.
Then, at about 1:30 p.m., the team ar-
rived at Ohio Wesleyan and waited
for the game to begin. The team
seemed relaxed and ready to go.

Soon after the opening faceoff,
however, it was clear that the
Generals were not at their best. The
Bishops scored just 20 seconds into
the game—before W&L had a chance
to set up its defense.

By the end of the first quarter, the
Generals trailed the Bishops by a 4-0
margin. Ohio Wesleyan built a 8-1
lead before the Generals managed to
take advantage of some Ohio Wes-
leyan mistakes to cut the margin to
five, 8-3, but they never got any
closer.

The Bishops shut the Generals out,

W&L scores in the first game against Ohio Wesleyan on Wilson Field.

4-0, in the third period, a quarter in
which the Generals have outscored
their opposition by 40 goals on the
year. Ohio Wesleyan continued its
onslaught, running the final score to
17-4 by the end.

“We were coming off an extremely

high emotional win [against
Roanoke],” said Daly, ‘“‘and maybe
some travel took its toll.

“But for one reason or another,
whereas we were at a very peak state
against Roanoke, we were not at the
same peak state against Ohio Wes-

leyan.”’

Despite the season-ending loss,
however, Daly was pleased with the
Generals’ performance this year.

“The season in general, I thought,
was a great year,” said Daly. ‘I'm

aren’t going out champions.

this team to get to be one of the top
four teams in the country because |

Mize, Wiman and Morris then
clinched the victory for the Generals,

their opponents.

In doubles, McLeod and Matthews
toppled Hammer and Mark Frisk

tiebreaker while Wiman and Morris
mopped up at No. 3 doubles for W&L.

The win set up a semifinal matchup
on Tuesday with fourth-seeded
University of California at Santa
Cruz, which defeated Principia 6-3.
The Sea Lions had not lost a D-III
match all season against some for-
midable competition and were prim-
ed for an upset.

The Generals were up to the task,
though, as they battled to a hard-
earned 5-4 victory. W&L had a 4-2
lead after the singles matches but
had difficulty in the doubles until

match with a two-set win over Mark
Cassell and Jordan Einbinder (ITCA
No. 8).

Kalamazoo reached the finals with
relative ease. The Hornets had little
difficulty with Swarthmore (9-0) on
Monday and rolled over Washington
College (7-2) on Tuesday.

Although all the players performed
well in the tournament, special
recognition should be given to Mat-
thews. Matthews, the ITCA No. 27-
ranked player in the country, went
undefeated over the three days, win-
ning all three of his singles and team-
ing with McLeod to win all three of
his doubles matches.

The individual portion of the cham-
pionship tournament begins today
with Haley, Matthews, McLeod and
Mize to participate in the singles
bracket and the tandems of McLeod
and Matthews and Haley and Mize to
compete in the doubles. The team
will return after the final round of the
individual matches are completed on

semifinals in singles.

The Ring-tum Phi, May 14, 1987

 

By MICHAEL TUGGLE
Entertainment Editor

When you think of films such as
Singing in the Rain, Rocky, The Big
Chill and Top Gun, what do you
remember? Maybe you remember
the dancing, or the fight sequences,
or the story, or the special effects.
There are literally hundreds of things
that could spark your memory, but in
truth there is one thing that stays
with you longer than anything else:
the music. In today’s world of film-
making, a popular soundtrack in the
record stores usually means a
popular film at the theatres. And
nowhere has this been more evident
than in the films released during the
past year. Nearly every film that has
been successful at the box office has
turned out at least one top 40 hit and
an excellent supporting soundtrack.

So, as a kind of “Year in Review”
for movie soundtracks, here are my
five choices for “Soundtrack of the
Year.”

The number five spot belongs to
Little Shop of Horrors. There have
been very few musicals in the history
of stage that have made a successful
transition to film, but Little Shop of
Horrors is one of them. The ’50s doo-
wop style ‘‘Da Doo,” the ballad
“Somewhere That’s Green,’’ the
dynamic duet ‘‘Suddenly Seymour,”
and the Motown numbers “Feed
Me!”’ and ‘‘Mean Green Mother from
Outer Space,” all combine with the
special effects to make this film a
delight. The songs are performed
well, they’re clear, and they’re cat-
chy. Buy this soundtrack and you'll
find yourself singing the songs by the
hour.

Ennio Morricone’s soundtrack for
The Mission is the fourth best sound-

track of the year. Morricone won an
Academy Award nomination for this
score, again proving what a
master he is at composing for film.
Morricone’s title theme, a sweet, yet
haunting melody for the oboe, can be
heard throughout the score in a
series of variations on the main
theme. The vocal pieces ‘‘Ave Maria
Guarani,’’ and ‘“‘Te Deum Guarani,”’
performed by the English ensemble,
London Voices, along with the open-
ing piece, “On Earth As It Is In
Heaven”’ are beautiful. Any lover of
classical music would cherish a copy
of the soundtrack from The Mission.
Its beauty is only outweighed by that
of the film as a whole.

The third best soundtrack of the
year come from what everyone is
calling the year’s finest film The
soundtrack from Platoon mixes both

classical and popular music to
enhance the haunting themes
presented in the film. Barber’s

“Adagio for Strings’ begins and
finishes the soundtrack much in the
solemn way it begins and ends the
film itself. In between the Barber
piece comes songs from the Vietnam
era such as “Tracks of my Tears’’ by
Smokey Robinson, ‘Hello, I Love
You’ from the Doors, ‘‘Respect”’
from Aretha Franklin's early days,
and Otis Redding’s ‘‘Sittin’ on the
Dock of the Bay.’’ The popular selec-
tions for the soundtrack are well
chosen and well put together, but
“Adagio for Strings” is what makes
this soundtrack truly outstanding.
Barber’s music is beautiful, yet in-
credibly haunting, like the relation-
ships that Oliver Stone creates in the
film. Platoon is simply the year’s
finest film all the way around.

Top Gun is the second best sound-
track of the year. Top 40 hits such as
Kenny Loggins’ ‘“‘Danger Zone’’ and
“Playing with the Boys,” along with

‘Stand By Me’ — the year’s best soundtrack.

Loverboy’s ‘‘Heaven in Your Eyes,”’
helped catapult this album to the top
of the charts last summer, and con-
tinue to keep it hot in the record
stores as we close in on this summer.
In addition, Berlin’s ‘Take My
Breath Away” won the Academy
Award for “Best Song” back in Mar-
ch. If there was one soundtrack that
helped make a movie great this year,
it would have to be Top Gun. Every
scene in the film is enhanced and im-
proved by music. Without it, Top Gun
would be just another film.

The soundtrack of the year comes
from my favorite film of last sum-
mer, Stand By Me. Rob Reiner’s
wonderful film chronicling the
adventures of Chris, Gordie, Teddy,
and Vern setting out to find the body
of a missing boy is by all means one

Movie Critic

 

Blake Edwards’ new film, Blind
Date, is like a marathoner who
doubles his pace for the first six
miles of a race. By the time he
reaches the last six miles there is
nothing left.

Blind Date is really funny for the
first 30 minutes. After that, nothing is
funny and everything is cliche. The
plot turns into the same old story,
with the same old ending, with the
same old performances that every
moviegoer has seen a_ thousand
times.

The film is very disappointing; but
then coming from Blake Edwards, a
disappointing film is nothing new.
Not since 10 has Edwards made a
film that had any value at all, and un-
fortunately this film is no different.

For starters, look at the main cast.
In the first male lead, Bruce (Addi-
son-Bruno-Mr. Seagrams) Willis has
shown repeatedly that he is in-
credibly talented and quite funny. So
why give him a repetitive role that
does nothing but run itself into the

State to become a tri

By MICHAEL TUGGLE
Entertainment Editor

 

For those of you who have been
curious as to why the State Theatre
looks more torn apart each time you
see a movie, here is the answer: con-
struction and renovation. Provided
that work stays on schedule, on June
1 the State will be three theatres,
theatres instead of one.

According to Henry W. Flint,
manager of the State and Lyric
R.C. Theatres has decided to re-
novate the State and make it into
a triple. The Baltimore-based com-

   

pany is following the lead of many
major theatre companies, which
have started to convert large old
theatres into multiple film complex-
es. In fact, it seems that grand old
theatres everywhere are destined to
die out slowly; just as the drive-ins
did some years ago.

The construction on the State in-
volves mainly the installation of two
sound-proof walls. One wall will be
installed from the floor of the balcony
to the ceiling, approximately six feet
from the balcony’s edge, and will
separate, the upstairs theatres from
the ones located downstairs. The sec-

Annual

cond wall will then be installed down
the middle of the balcony to split the
upstairs into two smaller theatres.

Once completed, Flint says that the
downstairs theatre will hold between
250 and 265 people, while the two
theatres upstairs will hold 100 and 115
respectively.

One obvious ramification of the
theatre construction is that it will im-
prove film selection in Lexington.

Whether or not a film is held over is
determined by the revenue the
theatre receives for that film on Fri-
day, Saturday and Sunday. If a cer-
tain revenue is not attained, then the

of the five best films of the year. The
film is well cast, well filmed, and
perhaps above all, very well scofed.
The soundtrack is a classic collection
of ’50s hits. “Everyday” by Buddy
Holly, ‘‘Let the Good Times Roll’”’ by
Shirley and Lee, ‘‘Get A Job’”’ by the
Silhouettes, ““‘Yakety Yak’’ by the
Coasters, ‘‘Great Balls of Fire’ by
Jerry Lee Lewis, and of course, the
title track by Ben E. King can all be
found on the Stand By Me collection.
Just as the soundtrack from The Big
Chill was a wonderful representation
of the songs from the ’60s, Stand By
Me is one for the 50s. Enough good
things cannot be said about the score
from this film. If you want an album
that you will always keep and not get
tired of, then get this year’s most
outstanding soundtrack, Stand By Me.
You will be glad you did.

Blind Date is a disaste

ground?

In the female lead, Kim (9%
Weeks) Basinger is unquestionably
one of the most beautiful women in
Hollywood and definitely an up-and-
coming actress. So why dress her
down, make her only relatively pret-
ty, and then stick her into a role that
demands a sexy, seductive woman?

In the second male lead, John
(“Night Court’) Larroquette is, with
maybe the exception of Bill Cosby,
the funniest man on television. His
Dan Fielding role on “Night Court”’
is absolutely hilarious, and very
close to his role in Blind Date; yet his
character in the film never quite
makes it. Why? Because Blake Ed-
wards’ direction of this film is ab-
solutely horrible.

A film about a blind date could be
absolutely hilarious with a decent
director and script writer. Unfor-
tunately, Blind Date has neither. I
feel sorry for Willis, Basinger, and
Larroquette. It must be very dis-
heartening to be talented and have to
perform in the midst of mediocrity.
Sorry guys!

TUG’S TAG — %&

le

film leaves on Thursday to make way
for a new one. With three theatres,
Flint hopes to be able to keep the
films for a longer period. He said that
the main attraction will be shown
downstairs in the big theatre, while
films from previous weeks or less
popular films will be shown upstairs.
When a film begins to drop in ticket
sales, it will simply move to one of
the small theatres upstairs, prolong-
ing its stay.

“It will be really nice when we
finish,” Flint commented. If all goes
as planned, it will be nice. If I had to
guess though, ticket sales will pro-
bably go up. But who knows? Maybe
the theatres will have discount night
at each theatre on different nights of
the week. You think...? Nah.

Rockin’ Rick

Last Saturday Rick Pierce started
a 91-song countdown of the greatest
hits of all time based on the all-time
hits recorded in Billboard magazine,
the requests for songs that WLUR
and other stations have received, and
the influence that the songs had on
the music industry and society at the
time of their release.

After four years of working at the
University radio station, Pierce sees
the countdown as something he can
give to the station, and to the
students of Washington and Lee.

So for the next two Saturday morn-
ings from 9 to 12, Rick Pierce will
bring you the final 60 greatest hits of
all time on Lexington’s finest,
