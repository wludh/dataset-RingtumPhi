On Monday, February 3, J. Stewart
Bryan III, publisher of the Richmond
Times-Dispatch and News Leader,
delivered his speech on First Amend-
ment Freedoms in duPont Audi-
torium.

Earlier, Bryan was named the 1987
recipient of the annual First Amend-
ment Award given by the Washington

-and Lee chapter of the Society of Pro-

fessional Journalists, Sigma Delta
Chi. Before Bryan made his speech in
front of the crowd at the auditorium,
he wanted to make sure that this
award was a result of the entire
Times-Dispatch and News Leader,
including the two reporters who were
present at the controversial murder
trials that led to this decision, Tim
Wheeler and Kevin McCarthy.

The award was the result of
Bryan’s leadership role in the Rich-
mond newspapers’ litigation that
resulted in the landmark by the
United States Supreme Court. The
Richmond newspapers case estab-

 

From Staff Reports

 

Nearly 30 percent of employers
of new college graduates now
screen job applicants for drug
use, and another 20 percent plan
to adopt the practice within the
next two years, according to a
new study by the College Place-
ment Council, Inc. (CPC).

Of the 497 national employers
surveyed, 140 (28.2 percent) said
drug screening, usually including
urinalysis, was required of poten-
tial employees. Almost all em-
ployers with screening programs
tested for both marijuana (97.9
percent) and hard drugs (98.6 per-
cent).

“The data found in our survey
corroborate other reports that
drug screening programs are on
the rise. Clearly the study shows
this is a major employment
issue,”’ said Warren E. Kauffman,
Acting Executive Director of
CPC.

The vast majority of employers
that required drug screening (88.6
percent) said they would not hire

 

lished that the closing of a criminal
court trial in the absence of over-
riding counter interest was invalid
under the First and Fourteenth
Amendments. The decision, how-
ever, did not stop trial closures.

At the time of these trials, he had
just become publisher of the two
Richmond papers.

After his speech, Bryan agreed to
take questions from the audience.
When asked if he felt that there were
any casés-that the press should be ex
cluded from, he responded ‘I’m sure

that there are times when the courts '

should be closed to the press. ‘‘ But
he said he was not sure what types of
cases those should be.

When asked about the issue of
presidential executive privilege be-
ing a legal right, Bryan responded,
“T won’t even try to answer that.’”’ He
also said that his two major reserva-
tions in pursuing a case were paying
th lawyers, because he felt they (the
papers) thought that the cases might
not get looked at by the courts.

Bryan spoke hightly of the judge
who barred his reporters from the

college-trained applicants who
failed a drug test. However, 37.9
percent said they would retest ap-
plicants, and 75 percent said ap-
plicants who failed could reapply
and receive favorable reconsid-
eration later.

Employers ranked safety as the
top reason for establishing drug
screening programs, selecting it
nearly four times more often than
security, which ranked second. In
descending order of importance,
other reasons included quali-
ty/reliability of products; quality
of service; increased productivi-
ty; control of medical costs; and
law, government, or noncompany
regulations.

Of the 140 employers that
reported screening programs, the
highest percentages were in the
following industries: utilities (37.1
percent); chemicals, drugs and
allied products (9.3 percent);
aerospace (8.6 percent); and-
petroleum and allied products (7.9
percent).

likeable man and that he is still
presiding. ‘‘He let us intervene and
obviously wanted the Supreme Court
to look into the case because he
thought is was so muddy,” he
remarked.

When asked about the public’s at-
titude toward First Amendment
Laws, Bryan answered “I don’t think
the public cares too much about the
Bill of Rights. The public wants the
press to give them the news and tney
con't care how hard it is to get. This
is a problem and we (the press)
should try to educate the public.”’

On the Iran-Contra affair, he felt
that the television networks were
overplayiung the issue by making it
the top story every night. He said
that in his paper they put something
in each issue about the affair, but it is
not the headline story unless a new
development occurs.

In his comments about the state of
the press he felt that regional papers
are doing very well right now. He
also said that, despite what critics

ampson is
suspended

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Assignments Editor

 

After reconsidering its initial deci-
sion, the Student Conduct Committee
voted Tuesday to suspend Phillip L.
Sampson Jr. for shooting a 15-year-
old girl witha blowdart.

Unless he successfully appeals the
decision to the 10-member Student
Affairs Committee, Sampson will be
suspended through the end of the
school year.

Sampson, a freshman from
Houston, last week had been placed
on social probation for the rest of the
term and conduct probation the rest
of the year by the 13-student SCC. But
the SAC reviewed the case last
Thursday and asked the SCC to
reconsider the penalty.

The girl, a local high school stu-
dent, is the daughter of W&L
Associate Dean of Students Leroy C.
“Buddy” Atkins. She was hit in the
shoulder but was not injured serious-
ly.
Atkins, a member of the SAC, par-
ticipated in Thursday’s discussion
but abstained from voting, according
to Dean of Students Lewis G. John,
chairman of the SAC.

John said that the SAC agreed with
the SCC’s finding that Sampson was
guilty of a major offense under
university rules because he inflicted
bodily injury. The only two penalties
that may be given for such an offense

are suspension and expulsion, unless
the case involves ‘‘unusual extenua-
tion.”’

John said the SAC could not find
any extenuating circumstances. It
did not ask for a specific penalty,
John said, only that the initial penal-
ty be reconsidered.

A varsity football player and pole
vaulter, Sampson on Saturday
vaulted a school-record 14 feet six
inches indoors at Virginia Military
Institute. When asked Wednesday if
he would appeal the SCC’s decision to
the SAC, Sampson politely said he did
not want to talk about the case.

Sampson told the Phi two weeks
ago that he did not shoot Atkin’s
daughter on purpose, that he had not
meant to hit anyone with the dart and
that he didn’t find out that the girl
had been hit until the next day.

He wrote her an apology.

The incident occurred after the
W&L-Roanoke basketball game on
Jan. 15. Sampson said he shot the
dart from a second-floor window of
the Graham-Lees dormitory toward
some Roanoke fans who were mak-
ing degrading comments to incite the
W&L students. He estimated that the
Roanokers were between 50 and 75
yards away.

Sampson said he knew he could not
shoot the dart that far but thought
that it might intimidate them.

University Proctor Charles F.
“Murph” Murray said the dart was at
least four inches long.

French novelist

By CATHERINE McCUBBIN
Staff Reporter

 

A best-selling French novel has
made ‘‘Washington and Lee” a
household word in France, and in-
spired comparision with “The Cat-
cher in the Rye” and “The Great
Catsby.”” “‘L’etudiant etranger,’’ or
“The Foreign Student,” concerns the
experiences of Philippe Labro, who
attended Washington and Lee Uni-
versity on a scholarship in the 1950’s.

Labro, a prominent French jour-
nalist, had written two previous
novels, as well as directing several
films, one of which was shot in the
Lexington area. His latest work con-
cerns a young man coming of age in
the atmosphere of privilege and con-
formity which characterized Wash-
ington and Lee in the 1950’s. Labro’s
prose evokes scenes familiar even to-
day:

“*...whiffs of green grass and Pabst

After swearing in four new
members, the Washington and Lee
Board of Trustees will consider a
possible tuition increase while ia
Lexington this weekend.

The most important business on
the board’s agenda will be to look at
the preliminaries of the 1987-88
budget and to consider another in-
crease in tuition.

“It is not that they will approve
next year’s budget,”’ said Farris P.
Hotchkiss, who recently was named
secretary of the board. That budget
will not be completed until the
spring, Hotchkiss said, with the final
vote scheduled for May,

The trustees do have to decide next
year’s tuition because this informa-
tion must be available for the high-
school seniors who are considering
W&L, Hotchkiss said.

Hotchkiss said he did not know how
large a tuition increase the board
was considering. W&L President
John D. Wilson said he would make a

Although Labro never mentions
Washington and Lee by name in the
book, he does refer to several sur-
rounding women’s colleges, such as
Hollins and Sweetbriar. He also
refers to many of his companions as
well as professors by name. He men-
tions O.W. Riegel, then chairman of
the journalism department, and jour-
nalism Professor Paxton Davis hav-
ing a particular influence on his life
at Washington and Lee.

Professor John Lambeth, who has
translated parts of ‘‘L’etudiant
etranger”’ into English, remarked on
the book’s ‘‘wonderful sense of action
and description.’’ He noted Labro’s
“sense of humor and acute eye for
telling details about a place.’’ In all,
he said, ‘‘L’etudiant etranger’’ is “‘a
very good and well-written book.”

“L’etudiant etranger’’ has won
four literary awards in France, in-
cluding the prestigious ‘“‘Le Prix In-
terallie.’’ Now in its seventh printing,
the book is at the top of French best-
seller lists. At last count, 118,000
hardcover copies had been sold. The
book is scheduled to be translated in-
to English and published in the

declined to comment further.

In 1985, the board increased tuition
8.9 percent from $6,515 to 7,100. In
1986, it was increased 7 percent to
$7,600.

The board meeting is set to begin
tomorrow evening and to last until 1
p.m. on Saturday. A dinner honoring
former board Secretary James
Whitehead and his wife will be held
Friday night.

The four new board members were
scheduled to be on campus today for
orientation. They are Dr. William
Gottwald, Richard Haynes, Patricia
Leggett and Vaughan Morrissette.
They were named in the fall, replac-
ing Calvert Thomas and the Rev.
Christopher Keller Jr., who both
retired.

When the four are sworn in, the
board will have 27 members. Twenty-
four are expected to attend, Hotch-
kiss said. The maximum number of
board members allowed by W&L is
30.

The board’s next meeting is
scheduled for May 23 and 24.

 

 
 

OPINION
Destructive

Visitors to Washington and Lee are often captivated by the
simple elegance of our Colonnade. Its gracious and noble
facade are indicative of the good that is Washington and Lee;
its apparant sturdiness, a bulwark against the ravages of

 

time.

Not only the Colonnade, but the entire university is a part
of American history. Countless graduates have left Lex-
ington instilled with the ideals of honor, ideals which best
define the purpose of the University and which set
Washington and Lee alumni apart from graduates of other
universities. The University’s significance to the nation’s
history is of such magnitude that in 1972 it was declared a
Registered National Historic Landmark.

Recently someone decided an addition was needed to the
Colonnade, an addition which took the form of a painted ‘‘87.”’
Class pride is admirable, but there are better ways of ex-
pressing it than by anact of vandalism.

Those responsible consider themselves, as evidenced by
their enrollment in the University, to be honorable, but, by
their action, appear to contradict that assumption.

Upon first glance, the painting appears to be a typically
collegiate act. It is, however, something one would expect of
students at State U., not those of Washington and Lee. The
act shows a lack of respect both for the University and those

associated with it.

There was a time when attending Washington and Lee
marked a man as being polite, gracious and respectful -- i
meant having a sense of who you were and how you fit into

society.

Those adjectives cannot be applied to those responsible for
this despicable act, nor to those who tolerate it. If they are
applied to them, then all that Washington and Lee once stood
for is, like the society written about by Margaret Mitchell,

gone with the wind.

Honor means effort

MY VIEW

By Chris Carter

 

Certain events of last week not-
withstanding, the following rumina-
tions are inspired by two recent ar-
ticals: Jennifer Spreng’s My View of
the ‘“‘Ring-tum Phi’’ of two weeks ago
and an artical in the Jan. 22 edition of
the “W&L Law News.” Miss Spreng
asked, ‘Does any truth exist? I doubt
it.” The artical from the “Law
News” reported a survey of Law
Students’ beliefs in the Honor
System. I find both highly disturbing.

Although the poll of law students
indicates that 86% of the students
polled believe ‘‘the Honor Code is
working here in Lewis Hall,” only
44% of the second year class believes
that the Honor Code is “‘an integral
part” of their law school experience.
Less than half of a law class believes
that honorable behavior is conducive
to becoming a lawyer?! I would like
to think that the poll was simply
grossly statistically inaccurate, but I
have a horrible feeling that it’s ac-
tually somewhat close to the mark.
The Honor System askes no more
than that students live honest and
trustworthy lives; frankly, I hope I
never have any of these second year
students as my lawyers if they don’t
find truth and trust to be very impor-
tant.

One of the students who responded
negatively to the poll asked, ‘(How
can one be honorable in a com-
petative environment?” I’m afraid I
don’t understand her question. Sure-
ly a trial is a competitive situation,
yet I hope that any lawyer presenting
a case would act honorably by follow-
ing the ethical standards of the ABA
rather than doing anything — up to
and including breaking the law — in
order to win ‘the competition.” I
realize that Law Schools are suppos-
ed to be competitive, but again, I’m
not sure that I would ever want as my
counsel anyone who is more concered
about winning than about winning ac-
cording to the rules, or more impor-
tantly their doing what is ethically
and morally right. Those who cannot
handle the competition of law school
and act honorably ought to question
their attending it.

The concerns raised by Miss
Spreng’s colum are somewhat differ-
ent from, but just as disturbing as,
those of the Law School poll. Her
comments were principally concern-
ed with the Iran/Contra issue. As
long as she simply questions whether

ed, she is on relatively safe ground
although I have somewhat more faith
in the American Political system
than she. But when Miss Spreng
generalizes to question whether truth
exists and to indicate that in fact it
does not, that she questions much of
what she sees and hears, she brings
the Honor System dashing in to the
scene of the crime and makes me ask
her the same question which I put to
the law students — do you really
think you belong at this school?

If Miss Spreng does not believe that
truth exists, how does she propose to
tell it? Shall we assume henceforth
that all her work is plagiarized even
though she has signed the Pledge?
More importantly, shall we just
scrap the Honor System altogether
since we will never be able to know
the “‘truth” about potential violaters
the Honor System? I hope the answer
to all the above is ‘‘no!”’ I hope that
Miss Spreng, when she speaks,
speaks the truth to the best of her
ability. This does not mean she need
always be right — only that she try to
be so. We do not expect the Executive
Committee, nor a Student Body
Hearing, to be able to explain to
everyone’s complete satisfaction
how and why, in the most minute
detail, a certain event happened — I
think only God could do that. But we
do hope they can answer part of that
question, and answer it well enough
for a decision to be made, even
though a lot of work may be neces-
sary in order to gain enough of an
understanding to make that decision.

Perhaps what I really resent about
the two articles in question is that
both imply a disgusting laziness. It’s
easy to say that the Honor System
doesn’t work, or has some bugs, or to
play the game if you scrap the rules.
It’s also easy to say that truth doesn’t
exist; this saves the hours and days
and months sometimes necessary to
discern it. But I, for one, would
rather believe that we can determine
the truth and believe what others say
than live in the sort of meaningless
world Miss Spreng describes. I also
believe that the Honor System has
been an integral part of my under-
graduate experience, although to say
it has been meaningful is not to say
that is has always been easy. I hope
that Miss Spreng and the second year
law students in question, who, after
all, form a very small minority of the
University population, will think
about the implications they believe
and will come to the conclusion that
the pursuit of truth, though difficult,
is possible and is important
regardless of one’s career or age, or
anything else.

IFC representative
defends newly
adopted bylaws

 

MY VIEW
By Jeff Kelsey

 

Recently a great deal of criticism
has been leveled at the IFC and at
Associate Dean of Students ‘‘Buddy”’
Atkins over the new IFC by-laws. As
an IFC representative I have heard
the arguments on both sides and it
seems that many people still do not
understand the importance of pass-
ing many of these by-laws.

First, the question of liability for
fraternities makes these by-laws
necessary. In our increasingly liti-
gious age, a drunk driving accident
can result in drawn out law suits
resulting in millions of dollars in
awards to the victims. If such a suit
were filed against a whole fraternity
at W&L that house would die from the
financial burden. The basic problem
lies in the fact that fraternity houses
are not designed to serve alcohol
under the new drinking age laws. No
one checks ID’s at a fraternity party
and I can not really foresee a change
in this policy. Obviously, the loss of
kegs at parties is not going to keep
underage people from drinking. But
from my point of view that is not the
purpose of the new by-laws. The pur-
pose is to put the burden of respon-
sibility on the individual. If an
underage person wants to drink he
has to find someone old enough to buy
alcohol for him or he can employ a
fake ID (although the latter is very

risky given the EC’s statement on
fake I.D.’s). Regardless of what the
individual does, he has to take the in-
itiative and not rely on the fraternity

to provide for him. The liability is ef- ‘

fectively removed from the officers
and members of the fraternity so that

the individual is solely responsible *

for his own state of intoxication.

Dean Atkins has presented many
other ways for the individual houses
to limit their liabilities and many of
the techniques are incorporated in
the by-laws. But to say that Dean
Atkins has railroaded these by-laws
through the IFC is unfair. Yes there
was pressure to revise and ratify the
by-laws, but that pressure came

from other parts of the administra- |

tion. If the truth were known, I ven-
ture to guess that much of the faculty
and administration would favor do-

ing away with fraternities alto- ,

gether, thus avoiding the headaches.
Dean Atkins, on the other hand,
understands the importance of the
fraternity system in all aspects of
school life, and I believe he prodded
us into taking some initiative so the
University would not seek to take
control of the IFC. It is obvious to me
that Dean Atkins has the fraternities’
best interests in mind.

In conclusion, I wish we still had
kegs as much as anyone else; and

buying beer every weekend is becom- |

ing expensive. However, with the
new drinking age fraternities just
can not afford the risk of kegs. The
parties will continue irregardless
and the fraternities will remain the
center of the W&L social life.

To The Editors:

Having once been an advocate of coeducation
at Washington and Lee and having lobbied for its
implementation, I find it no longer bearable to
keep my guilty conscience silent. The fact is that
now I have witnessed coeducation, I no longer
support it.

The issue of coeducation did not die on July 15,
1984, nor is it a non-reversible state. So let us
reexamine, once again, our little experiment,
this time with the aid of hindsight. The main
argument against coeducation was that it would
break 235 years of all-male tradition at W&L.
The Board of Trustees obviously refused to ac-
cept anything simply on the grounds that it is
traditional. Their decision speaks for itself.

The main reason for going coed is that it would
help boost sagging intellectual involvement and
increase enrollment. But what I have witnessed
the past two years is neither. Women in the
classroom have only brought the courting ritual,
once reserved for the weekend, into twenty-four
hour-a-day existence. Men once dedicated to the
art of collaboration and intimate relationships
with their professors, now cringe and blubber
dotingly, mesmerized by the presence of their
mother image three seats over.

The “tradition”, that word which we so often
speak of but rarely define, now absent, has
become apparent. It is that unique opportunity
which a college offers to strive for truth in a
fraternal atmosphere following the footsteps of
the country’s greatest leaders. What I have
witnessed the last two years is the emasculation
of one of the country’s few remaining masculine
reservoirs, now polluted with the poison of
cleavage and Eau de Cologne.

In essence, what has happened at W&L is what
would happen if women were allowed into the ar-
my: the battlefield would become a bedroom, the
weight room a dancing floor, and the newspaper
a gossip column. I am not a chauvinist, nor do I
dislike women, it’s only women at W&L that I ob-
ject to. I am simply offering my dissatisfaction
with a college ruled by overzealous ad-
ministrators who end up turning a perfectly fine
academic institution into a post-high school
country club complete with birthday dinners and
the latest in debutantes.

Perhaps our administrating body should take a
refresher course in Econ 101. A low supply of all-
male liberal arts colleges yields a high demand,
whereas a large supply of coed, aristocratic
finishing schools returns a low demand. Our all-
male tradition is what sets us apart from all the
other small liberal-arts colleges and to renounce
it is a wish to complacently exist with the rest of
the masses.

Is Washington and Lee a democratic com-
munity or one masked with democratic ideals
but actually governed by an elite few? Perhaps
our administrators fancy themselves a mon-
archy, Each man has a vote in this institution,
not just a few hand-picked starched shirts who
can but their way onto the Board of Trustees. If I
am mistaken in believing I represent the student
bodies opinion, then I am glad to be one of the
graduating few who knew W&L as it once was,
than as it is now and will never be again.

To the college administration all I ask is that
they heed the path of the Coca-Cola Company,
who finally realized that the public like the old
formula better and that mistakes are not irrever-
sible. If the women here object, one can only
scoff at their presumption for thinking they

Fight for your rights

To The Editors:

Ed Klank is at it again! Although his latest ar-
ticle smacks of J.J. (jaundiced journalism), we
support his stand on this, a most serious pro-
blem. Although none of us are in danger of rot-
ting away (we don’t jog), we sympathize with
said Mr. ‘‘Rash.”’ It is time the male side of the
student body stood up for its rights. There is a
storm cloud on the horizon that bodes ill for male
institutions at Washington & Lee. Think of it! To-
day, no rash ointment, tomorrow, no fraterni-
ties. The male members of the student body
must now rise and push to secure their ever-
shrinking share of the student rights pie!

Klank irritates sophomore

To The Editors:

After reading another of Mr. Klank’s truly
poignant articles, I am amazed that a person
with his writing ability and co rehension of the
English language is allowed to have his articles
printed in this newspaper, much less any news-
paper in America, I think his talents should be
used elsewhere, for example I notice that the
Ring-tum Phi does not publish a menu for the up-
coming week in the dining hall or Cockpit. Per-
haps after his Crusade for Cruex is complete he
could devote his efforts to this next venture.

Sincerely,

Changes disturb student

To The Editors:

Addressing the article in the Jan. 8th issue of
the Ring-tum Phi entitled “USA Today says
W&L ‘choosy’.’’ I think Mr. Hartog shouldn’t try
to justify coeducation by the high retention rate
of students remaining at W&L after their
freshman year. Washington and Lee has been a
well liked school before coeducation was ever
thought up. Coeducation hasn’t bothered me as
much as the snowball effect of the changes that
have occurred at this University since my

freshman year. From minor changes such as the
changing of the name of the “Cockpit” to the
“GHQ” to the major changes like increasing the
enrollment (which has forced some freshman to
live in closets) and the extreme push to knock
fraternity parties out.

As you can see in the article on the same page
of the Jan. 8th issue of the Phi entitled “W&L
ranks 8th in national survey,’’ shows that
graduates from W&L (before girls have ever
completed 4 years here) have been very suc-
cessful. I don’t feel a school is a great school
because according to surveys and statistics they
are one of the ‘“‘choosiest colleges”’ in the nation.
It is the education and atmosphere that colleges
offer that makes them great institutions. Prior to
coeducation W&L was known as a good school
with successful graduates, but now it seems as if
everyone wants it to be known as an Ivy League
school that has students with high SAT scores
(which don’t reveal anything personal about a
student.)

I hope students, faculty, and alumni read this
letter and submit their opinions because no one is
commenting on how the attitude of W&L is
changing.

Tommy McBride ’88

More on Klank

To The Editors:

I certainly must agree with Mr. Klank that the
supply store is horribly misguided for not carry-
ing antifungal creams. No doubt Mr. Klank has
probably ‘“‘rubbed himself raw’ on more than
one occasion.

What surprises me, however, is the fact that
while Mr. Klank is so concerned about others’
groin afflictions and a possible plague of Tinea
Cruris he neglects his own case of chronic oral
diarrhea. May I suggest a mouthful of Kaopec-
tate or Donnagel once or twice a week?! Or at
least before he writes his next column!

Please extend to Mr. Klank my sincere wishes
for an improvement in his apparently terminal
condition.

ford, the challenge of Washington
and Lee’s production of ‘“‘Cabaret”’ is
largely a conceptual one.

Parker, choreographer for the pro-
duction, and Radford, the show’s
costume designer, face the challenge
of vividly portraying the city of
Berlin in the 1930s, a period that saw
the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi
party.

The subject of pre-World War II
Berlin is not new to Parker, an ac-
tress, director, choreographer,
singer, and playwright who is cur-
rently working out of New York. In
fact, one of the two plays she has
» Written is called ‘Berlin 1922.”

Parker became involved with the
* show at the request of director
, Joseph Martinez, who is associate
professor of drama at W&L. Parker
’ and Martinez were classmates for
, three years at the Royal Academy of
Dramatic Arts in London.
¥  “]’ve wanted to work with Joe for a
long time, and when the opportunity
presented itself recently, I couldn’t

and I share the same vision of
theatre, a vision which could best be

Her vision of ‘‘Cabaret’’ is no ex-
ception. Parker is choreographing

with what she describes as ‘‘a con-
ceptual approach.”

‘
For seven years Gladys Steele has

’ been giving the homeless of Lex-
, ington a roof over their head, a warm
meal in their stomach, and someone
who would listen and understand
» their troubles.

When Andrew McThenia, a law

professor at Washington and Lee,
» decided he wanted to help the
homeless, his wife introduced him to
Steele. What has become of this rela-
tionship is Lexington’s first official
homless center, Gladys House.
* McThenia had been holding
meetings with local church officials
and any other interested citizens
’ when Steele first decided to attend
the meetings. About a month ago,
after sitting in on the meetings and
realizing the homeless needed a
place, Steele called McThenia and of-
fered her home as shelter for the
homeless,

“It was getting cold and I knew
that they would need a place to stay,”
* said Steele.
» Steele said she knew how the

homeless felt, because at one time
* these people were her ‘‘drinking bud-
+ dies.”’ Baptized this year at Victory

Baptist Church, Steele relies on her
* past experiences and a new faith to
» help her deal with the homeless, ‘‘her
friends who she is there to help.”’

Steele and McThenia don’t claim
+ full credit for the shelter saying it
was a community effort.

“‘T never dreamed so many people
y would be willing to help,” said Steele.

Many of the Lexington community
" churches have joined in the effort to
«help the homeless by giving money
and time.
Private citizens and companies

ture of the carefree, devil-may-care
attitude pervasive throughout Berlin
in the 1930s.”’

Approaching ‘‘Cabaret’’ concept-
ually came easily for Parker. In her
experience as an actress and direc-
tor, she has been very interested in
Brechtian theatre, an approach that
is not unlike the style of the current
production of ‘‘Cabaret.”’

“The mood of this style of theatre
is one of alienation,’ said Parker.
“In it, the actors confront the au-
dience, in effect bringing the stage
down to the audience and involving
them in the action. It’s quite unlike
musical comedy.”’

Brechtian theatre, said Parker,
began in Germany in the 1920s and
1930s, with the creation of the
“Berliner Ensemble.” This time
period provides the setting for
“Cabaret’’ as well.

For Radford, the show’s costume
designer, ‘‘Cabaret’” is no _ less
challenging. Her job was to create
designs that not only reflect the time
period and attitudes of pre-war
Berlin, but also have a ‘“‘punk-funk
look to them.”’

“‘The costumes have been designed
so that, while being slightly ana-
chronistic, they capture all that char-
acterized Berlin,’ said Radford.
From the nightclub costumes to the
stylized clothes of the Nazi youth,

The city council helped by waiving
the requirements to establish a
shelter, citing a cold weather
emergency until March, said Steele.

Local contractor Woody McDonald
and electrician Sid Brown have
donated their time and labor at cost
to remodel the house.

After the remodeling, Gladys said
that she will have her own part of the
house and there will be room for
about 10 cots upstairs.

Other important volunteers to the
project are the people who come over
and stay with the homeless at night
and make life easier for Gladys.

“At first Uncus (McThenia)
wanted it so I didn’t have to do
anything, but I wanted to be around
to help,” said Steele.

Steele said that she wanted to con-
tinue to do the cooking, stay around
during the day and be there at night if
her help was needed.

“T know alcholics, which most of
these people are, through no fault of
their own, and I want to be there
because I have the experience to help
them,” said Steele.

She relates most of the problems
people have with alcohol to the fami-
ly.
“If people could see and under-
stand the people I help, they would
know that arguing and fussing do no
good, but love and support does
help,” said Steele.

“T haven’t had any problems with
these people; they know and respect
my rules as well as me,” said Steele.

She has only three rules. Posted on
the wall next to the stairs they read:
“No alcohol or drugs in the house, no
firearms and no smoking above the
first floor.’’

“T have learned more about myself
since I started to deal with the
homeless,” said McThenia.

Both Steele and McThenia think

everything has been designed to be
similar to the original styles, yet ex-
aggerated to emphasize the unique-
ness of the time.

“Some of the costumes may be a
little advanced for this area, but they
remain accurate representations of
pre-war Berlin,’’ continued Radford.
“The nightclub outfits had to be
entertaining. They, like many of the
other costumes, are sensuous, but do
not cross over into vulgarity.”’

“If the members of the audience
bring anything away with them from

Snowstorm
damages
buildings

By GEORGE G. SPARACIO
Staff Reporter

 

 

Most of the damage to the
Washington and Lee campus from
the past snowstorms was caused by
melting snow. The buildings with the
most damage were Howe, DuPont
and Reid Halls.

James L. Arthur, the Superinten-
dent of Buildings and Grounds, said
that the reason for this problem is
that these particular buildings have
“secret” gutters, meaning that they
are hidden from view. Exposed gut-
ters, as are found on Washington and
Tucker Halls, are much more effi-
cient, but the style of the building
warranted ‘‘secret’’ gutters. Arthur
said that when the snow accumulated
on the roofs, it melted, then froze in
the gutters. The gutters pulled apart
with little drainage occuring. In addi-
tion, the icicles put a strain on the
gutters, causing some to fall down.

Reid Hall was the worst damaged,
according to Arthur. There is rain
leakage at least once a year accord-
ing to R.J. deMaria, Professor of
Journalism. There was leakage in
both the WLUR and Cable Nine
studios.

Two members of Cabaret rehearse a scene.

   

‘Cabaret,’ ’’ said Radford, “I hope it
would be a perspective of what Ger-
many was like in the 1930s. Its people
were futilely trying to escape from a
reality that surrounded them in their
daily lives.”

Local theatregoers will be able to
see the results of these professionals’
work when ‘‘Cabaret”’ is presented at
the university’s General Headquar-
ters Feb. 6 - 11, at 8 p.m. The show
will be preceded by a German-style
buffet that will include potato and

Student workers wallpapered
Washington and Lee with band
posters earlier this week in a final ef-
fort to attract a big crowd for this
weekend’s Muscular Dystrophy
Association Superdance.

The ninth edition of W&L’s multi-
round fight against neuromuscular
diseases will begin with registration
at 7:30 a.m. Saturday. The 18-hour
dance marathon will begin at about 9
a.m. in the Student Activities
Pavilion.

Dancing will continue throughout
the morning, with breaks for special
events to keep the dancers moti-
vated. WLUR-FM will hold a 20-hour
radio marathon in honor of its 20th
anniversary, providing music for the
dancers and live interviews from the
pavilion. The radiothon will begin at
6a.m., and the disc jockeys will take
requests and dedications for a small
fee to be donated to the Muscular Dy-
strophy Association.

Although the admission price first
was reported at $8.50, adviser Fon-
tanne Bostic said the price will be on-
ly $8. Tickets are good for the entire
dance.

They'll be followed by Covacus at 7
p.m. and the very popular White
Animals at 10:15. They will perform
until about 1:30 a.m.

Pie throws begin at 9:30 p.m.

Bostic said that Associate Dean of
Students Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy”’ Atkins
and Lacrosse Coach Dennis Daly had
agreed to be on the receiving ends of
the pie tins. Other pie throws may be
added, Bostic said.

Organizers of the dance have set a
goal of raising $30,000 for MDA.

A year ago about 150 individuals
danced in the event, which raised
more than $34,000 for the Muscular
Dystrophy Association.

Superdanceco-chairmen Jim
Barker and Tom Thagard anticipate
that 300 dancers will participate in
this year’s event.

Various prizes, including trips to
the Virgin Islands, Georgetown, and
the Canaan Valley, will be awarded
to the dancers who receive the most
pledges.

Beer will be served to those of legal
drinking age. Proper college identi-
fication is required.

Further information about the
Superdance may be obtained by con-
tacting Bostic at 463-8448.

MY VIEW
By John T. Wiltse

It had been a long term and a long
drive home. It was hard to believe
that Christmas was only four days
away. I knew I would have to brave
the stores sooner or later — it could
wait to the afternoon, though. You
see, I always enjoy the first ‘sleep
in” of a break — no schedule, no
pressure, no classes. With a cup of
hot chocolate by my side, I began a
leisurely stroll through the morning
paper to get caught up on area news.

Then I saw the headline: ‘‘Newing-
ton Man, 21, Killed in Accident.” I
swalled hard before reading further
— even with 30,000 people in town
most names at least ring a bell. Sure
enough, it was Eric. We had gone all
through grade school together. He
went to a private Catholic high school
so I hadn’t seen him for over seven
years — nevertheless, this took me
by surprise. The article merely said
it was a one-car accident — I knew
the stretch of road, he was only a
minute from his house.

The calling hours were that after-
noon — what to do? It had been a long
time but something told me I should
go. Eric’s face and laugh were as
clear as if I had seen him yesterday.
His father was my music teacher
back in middle school and I also knew
one of his older brothers. Eric’s
father was always so proud of his
sons. Even if they wouldn’t recognize
me after all these years, Eric would
know I was there. He would do the
same for me. So, I went down to the
basement to get that suit I keep at
home for these times that aren’t
planned for. I’d go pay my respects
to Eric in between some of those
Christmas stops.

My mind kept drifting — how did
such a thing happen? My question
was answered by a high school
classmate I bumped into at one of the
stores. Her brother had responded to
the accident as a volunteer fireman.
Eric had tried to negotiate a curve at
over 80,m.p.h. and never made it -
the car blew up when it struck a tree.
He had been drinking with some of
his friends following a basketball
game at his alma mater.

As I signed my name at the funeral
home there was only one thought in
my mind — ‘‘what a waste.’’ My age.
A bright, pleasant individual. Only
four more months of college. Sudden-
ly, all my problems over the last thir-
teen weeks seemed so irrelevant.
Eric was dead. The look in his
parents’ eyes told the story —
Christmas would never be the same.
As I left, I thought about his friends
at Marquette University in Wiscon-
sin, wondering what they would think
when Eric didn’t return.

The question of why didn’t haunt
me, though. The answer was simple.
Eric didn’t care enough about
himself and those he left behind. And
the people he had been out drinking
with really weren’t friends. No one
had cared enough to look after Eric.
Clearly, there was a lack of love all
around.

What a waste. I took that suit back
down to the basement at the end of
the day. That’s the worst part
knowing that I will see the same
headline sometime in the future.
Damn, won’t we ever learn? Eric
would hope so.

When you break away this year,

It's touring the island on our breezy mopeds.
(Do remember to keep left!)

It's jogging on quiet country roads—including an
early morning 2-k “Fun Run” from Horseshoe Bay. It's
exploring the treasures in our international shops,
playing golf on eight great courses, and tennis on over
100 island-wide courts

But most of all, it's the feeling you get on a tiny,
flower-bedecked island, separated from everywhere
and everything by 600 miles of sea.

Hoops rebounds from loss

 

By MIKE SHADY
Assistant Sports Editor

 

Just when your are about to give up
on this team they do something that
brings a smile to your face.

On the heels of a defeat to Hamden-
Sydney, a game the Generals should
have won, the Washington and Lee
basketball team rebounded nicely
two days later to beat the then 16th-
ranked Wasps of Emory and Henry,
82-73, last Thursday night in the
Warner Center.

Coupled with a 84-70 home victory
over Lynchburg last Saturday, the
Generals find themselves in fourth-
place in the Old Dominion Athletic

“We stayed within our of-
fense,”’said head coach Verne Can-
field, “‘and when it didn’t work, we
reset it.”

Senior Jefferson Harralson turned
in a performance that comes ex-
tremely close to perfection. His
numbers read 29 points on 11 of 12
shooting, 5 assists, 8 rebounds and
even a blocked shot to boot. What was
evev more impressive was how con-
trolled he was on the offensive end,
many times passing up good shots in
order to dish off to teammates for
easier baskets.

“We were very unselfish,’ said
Harralson. ‘‘It’s very fun to play that
way. This was a real big win for us.”’

The Generals won the game from

Official discrepancy

““Would you like to step outside?”

I looked at the owner of the voice that was questioning me. It belong-
ed to a gray-haired old man, say 55-years-old, who was extremely
overweight. To be honest with you, the guy was a fat ugly slob.

Yes, ladies and gentlemen, Our hero was suddenly face-to-face with
the worst possible danger known to mankind — an irate country bump-
kin whose hometown basketball team had just lost.

It was an interesting conversation, for the most part. He wanted to
know what my problem was. I wanted him to prove to me he had a
brain. Yes, it was definitely one hell of a conversation.

You see, the only reason for the confrontation was the fact that the
man’s behavior during the basketball game appalled me. And he
wasn’t the only one. There were several other so called adults in the
stands for the opposition as well who were behaving in much the same
fashion.

Their actions? Well, in their eyes, every (and I mean every) single
call the officials made against their team was absolutely wrong.
Phrases such as “‘you suck ref” and ‘‘you guys are really giving them
this one’ were some of the many priceless gems spewing from the
mouths of these people.

I’m sure you're asking ‘so what?’ and also hoping that this isn’t
some tirade saying that fans should sit in their seats and politely clap
after each point. Far from the point. The problem was not with the ex-
cessive ref-berating but more with the lack of support for the team
itself. Only a few (and I mean a few) times did these people ever cheer
for their own team. Isn’t that the sole reason for going to a basketball
game in the first place?

On the road, in a sparsely filled gym, is not the time nor the place 0
let the official know what you think of his mother. The recent game
was an embarrassment for the both the people making the comments
and the surrounding people who had to listen to them.

One of the officials who did the game summed it up best. During a
timeout late in the game, shouts and screams were echoing throughout
the quiet gym and most of them were directed at the officiating. I look-
ed at the ref and shaking my head asked him if he could believe what
was happening. He smiled at me and said he couldn’t believe these
people were adults and that the students were acting 100 percent bet-
ter. Usually its the students, not the parents, that yell the obscentities.

Which brings me to my final statement. When our students go to a
game, it is a totally different situation. Sure, sometimes insults fly,
foul language is used and officiating is seriously questioned. But these
things cannot be helped. What really counts is towards the end of the
game, our fans (mainly Fiji’s) know it is the players who need the sup-
port, not the guys in the pin-striped shirts.

My question to those ignorant fans? Does your basketball team ever
get beat, or is it always the officials’ fault when they lose?

NOTES: Did anyone (who is not brain dead) watch the Pro Bow] last
weekend? Baseball, basketball and hockey are bad enough, but does
anyone care about a sport when the season is already over’...
Fascinating piece on the Golden State Warriors’ Chris Washburn in
Sports Illustrated this week. I wonder who changes Chris’ diapers
when he’s on the road?... I don’t think there has ever been a broadcast

head coach Dean Smith are. If I hear the phrase ‘Blue Heaven’”’

same amount of field goals. W&L
shot 90 percent (26 for 29), a much
improved statistic after some of their
recent efforts. The Generals led by as
little as three, 74-71, with two minutes
remaining, but some clutch free
throws by Harralson and sophomores
Lee Brading and Manny Klump iced
the game.

One could almost expect come sort
of an emotional letdown for the
Lynchburg game after Emory and
Henry. After all, Lynchburg came in-
to the contest dead last in the ODAC
with a 1-4 record. But W&L proved to
be too much for the over-matched
Hornets as the Generals slowly pull-
ed away throughout the game.

Brading led all scorers with 28
points, 18 of them coming in the sec-
ond half. W&L also received assis-
tance from a surprising source as
junior Lou Trosch poured in a career
high 16 points.

“Tt thought Lee and Lou played
very good games,” said Canfield,
“These guys have not been getting
the recognition that other people
have.”’

Lynchburg did expose the
General’s inability to defend a three-
point shooter. Peter Soens went 4 for
6 from downtown en route to his
team-loading 25 points.

“We’re still not zeroing in on the
Opposition’s potential three-point
shooters,” said Canfield.

Swimmers win three

From Staff Reports

 

Last week, the Washington and Lee
aquatics program enjoyed some

fast swims.

On Wednesday night both squads
squared up against Mary Washington
College, and again, the men won
while the women lost.

The men, now 7-1, swam exhibition
(non-scoring) for the second half of
the meet, and won 81-67. The Mary
Washington mens’ squad, however,
has more than tripled in size from
last year’s team of three.

Although the women lost to MWC,
124-84, they once again put on quite a
show. Led by sophomores Nancy
Whalen and Elizabeth Miles, the
women continued to swim personal
bests.

Miles qualified for Division III Na-
tionals in the 1650 yd. freestyle while
Whalen, who has been getting faster
every meet, broke the one minute
barrier that she has been aiming for
all season long.

Weekend wins against Shepherd
and Gettysburg brought the men’s
swimming team record to 6-1. The
women’s team beat Shepherd and
lost to Gettysburg to bring their
record to 4-3,

On Friday night, the men were im-
pressive against the against the

a

Shepherd Rams, whe upset the tra-
veling Generals last year, winning
88-58. Remillard said that the team
“‘was prepared, no matter how they
swam.” Shepherd was not the same
team as last year, having lost
several swimmers.

Against Shepherd, for the first time
ever, the W&L women had more
swimmers than the opposition. Rem-
illard said that ‘‘we took our licks last
year,” and the three-woman team of
Shepherd witnessed the turn-around
first hand.

Like the men, the Shepherd women
had lost a number of swimmers,
mainly to injury. It would seem that
even they couldn’t have helped, as
W&L won, 73-42.

On Saturday both teams faced the
Gettysburg Bullets, and the wins
were split. The men avenged last
year’s loss by a score of 117-68, while
the women lost to a sound Gettysburg
squad, 102-57.

The men’s varied line-up caught
the Bullets by surprise and Remil-
lard, who was looking for a close
meet, felt that his swimmers saw’
Gettysburg ‘‘crumble before our
eyes.”

The Generals won all but two of the
eleven individual races, and another
second in the 400 yard freestyle relay
to close out the meet.

Remillard said that it “‘was a great
whole meet.”

Wrestlers defeat Virginia State, 32-18

 

By DAVID EMRICH
Sports Editor

 

After two weeks of inactivity, due
at least partially to the big snow
storm, the Washington and Lee
wrestling team returned to the mats
this week with a win over Virginia
State and a home loss to Scranton.

Yesterday afternoon, the team
went on the road to Virginia State
and came away with a 32-18 victory.

Virginia State, for all intents and
purposes, spotted the Generals 12

team points at the start of the con-
test, forfeiting the first two bouts.

They were never able to climb out
of the hole, as the Generals added
wins from seniors Jeff Mazza (10-0),
Tim Walker (15-4), John Lowe (14-5),
and a technical fall by junior Steve
Castle.

Despite the win and the team’s im-
pressive record this season, W&L
head coach Gary Franke still
believes that there are things the
team could do better.

“We can still improve,” said
Franke. ‘‘We can become more cons-
cientious of the team score and what

our opponents are doing.”

Last Saturday, the Generals hosted
Scranton. The Scranton team proved
to be rude guests, beating W&L 32-15.

The meet was the first time the
Generals had seen action since Jan.
17th. The Generals were supposed to
host the W&L Invitational on Jan. 24,
but the snow put that tournament on
hold.

“As coaches we like to say that
type of thing [the inactivity] hurts
us,” said Franke. “‘Maybe that type
of break is more refreshing, maybe it
heals instead of hurts.”’

“T don’t think the layoff hurt us at

all,’’ concluded Franke.

Despite this, only three Generals
had their arms raised at the end of
their matches against Scranton, they
were Castle, who won by decision;
Mazza, who pinned his opponent; and
sophmore Richard Redfoot, who also
pinned his opponent.

“T ama little disappointed with the
way some of our wrestlers perform-
ed,’’ said Franke after the match.

This Saturday the Generals host a
triangular meet with Gallaudet and
Washington and Jefferson. The meet
starts at 1:00 p.m.

Individual performances highlight Relays

 

By JIM LAKE
Staff Reporter

 

The odds were certainly against a
record setting afternoon for Wash-
ington arid Lee’s Phillip Sampson in
the VMI Relays last Saturday.

The freshman pole vaulter knew
that the meet would feature Division
I athletes from throughout the south-
east. Consequently, Sampson said
that he really hadn’t expected to
place. “I just wanted to get up on the
pole and have a couple of godd
vaults. I wasn’t really intent on
vaulting really high. I just wanted to
get a little confidence.”’

Also, Sampson had twisted an
ankle while warming up for the start
of competition. ‘‘I was kind of unsure
about how my ankle was going to
hold up,”’ he said.

Nevertheless, Sampson set a
school record in the pole vault in his
first meet as a collegian, placing
fourth in the event by vaulting 14’-6”
a full six inches better than the school
record set by Gene Fellin nearly five

Head coach Norris Aldrige ‘was
really pleased” with Sampson’s per-
formance. Before the meet, “I
thought that he could clear 13-4,
maybe 14,”’ said Aldridge. ‘‘But now I
think that he’ll go even higher [than
14-6] before the year’s over.”

Looking at other W&L athletes, Al-
dridge said that he was also pleased
with the performance of Tom Mur-
ray. The senior was the only other
W&L athlete to place in the meet; he
took fourth in the shot put. Murray’s
last throw ‘‘was probably long
enough to get him third place, but he
scratched on it,”’ said Aldridge.

The Relays provided some of the
toughest competition that the
Generals will face all year, including
scholarship athletes from Clemson,
Virginia Tech, East Tennessee State,
and. many other Division I schools.
Aldrige said that he saw the meet as
a chance for his athletes ‘‘to get used
a ata al more than anything
e

In the running events, Aldridge
said that several W&L athletes per-

missed sixth place. Richard Moore
and Scott Rippeon ran well in the
distance events, and John White had
a “pretty good” 53.9 in the 400, he
said. “We had some good individual
performances for this early in the
season,” said Aldridge.

The W&L head coach said that the
field events featured good perfor-
mances for this early in the season,
said Aldridge.

The Generals will travel to

tion,” said Aldridge. Old Dominion

Music, acting key to play

 

By CHRIS CARTER
Drama Critic

 

I'wo observations: First, one can-
not judge the outcome of a dramatic
production from observing a dress
rehearsal. Second, the first observa-
tion notwithstandanding, ‘‘Caberet,:
presented by the music and Drama
Divisions of the Department of Fine
Arts, should be an excellent show
Well-cast and thoughtfully directed,
if it turns out not to be the Drama
Department’s best-performed pro-
luction in the last few years,
Caberet”’ is certainly the most am-
bitious. Director Joseph Martinez
‘leverly decided to use W&L’s own
tavern, the GHQ, as the stage, since a
large part of the action takes place in
a Berlin night-club.

Set in Pre-War Nazi Germany,
‘Caberet’”’ uses the play within a
play technique in its depiction of two
very different couples in love, but
unable to marry. As one would ex-
pect, the play has serious political
implications; sometimes Martinez
overemphasizes these themes, for-
getting that the most persuasive peo-
ple are often the most subtle, but
generally, he keeps the hammer
from pounding the head too hard.

Ginger McNeese and Tibor Ed-
mond should please everyone with
their very fine portrayal of the elder-
ly Frauline Schneider and Herr
Schultz, whose engagement is cut-off
by her fear that she will suffer at the
hands of the Nazis for his being
Jewish. Both have a strong sense of
their characters and maintain them
throughout the show. The second cou-
ple, ex-patriot Americans Sally
Bowles and Clifford Bradshaw, pro-
vides a younger and philosophical
‘ounterweight to the older politically
motivated German couple. Greg
Lunsford is a welcome return to the
W&L stage, putting in his ever-
professional performance, and Nan-
*y Stone is. ort literally, amazing
in her depiction vi a night-club singer
who refused to believe that life is
more than a whirl of parties, lovers,
nd caberets.

Presiding over the entire show is

have had in mind when he wrote the

play upon which this musical is bas-
ed. And music is a key word here, by
the way. The singing is fine through-
out, though as always happens, just a
bit ragged in the big dance scenes.
The orchestra, made up of members
of the W&L Instrumental Ensemble
and directed by Professor Robert
Stewart has obviously worked long
and hard on what is clearly not the
easiest of music. The best-known
piece from ‘“‘Caberet’’ is, of course,
the ever-popular theme song, but
others, such as “Don’t Tell Mama,”
should also be a delight for
newcomers to the show. Finally, the
dancing, staged by professional
choreographer Dian Parker, is
vigorous and leaves no holds barred.
One of the main reasons one goes toa
real ‘‘Caberet’’ is, naturally, for the
scantily-clad dancers doing the Can-
Can; again, no one will be diasp-
pointed on this count

Criticisms? Well, its hard to say

since I did only see a dress rehearsal,
which is bound to be a bit rough yet.

I’m sure that by showtime, the kinks
in scene changes and music cues will
all be worked out. The make-up, how-
ever, may irritate some viewers. All
but the two couples are heavily made
up in a garish cross between Punk
chic and Barnum & Bailey: some-
times it’s rather effective, but I re-
main unconvinced. The same com-
ment might be made about director
Martinez’s decision to use slides to
reinforce the political message. It’s
not that they’re ineffective -- just
rather unnecessary. These are m‘~or
points, however, against the very
superior acting which is what really
sustains the show.

“Caberet’’ opens February 6 and
runs through the 11th. Since the show
is reported to be sold-out, you should
call and get on the waiting list now. A
German cuisine dinner is being serv-
ed before the show from 5:45 to 7:30,
and German beer will be served dur-
ing the two intermissions. If you
can’t make it to Vegas and a real
caberet anytime soon, ‘‘Caberet’’ is
not a bad substitute.

Beastie Boys: Bad belch humor

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Entertainment Editor

 

The Beastie Boys are this year’s
consumer rap-trap; a rock group
with a record, ‘“‘License To III,” that
is not music — not even, believe it or
not, interesting pop culture — but,
rather, a relentless, air-tight
marketing concept. It is a comedy
album that is not really all that fun-
ny. It is a record with no socially
redeeming qualities whatsoever.
(And remember, in the case of, say,
Van Halen, this used to be a compli-
ment

For those who don’t know already,
the Beastie Boys are currently the
hottest rap group in the country. Of
course, popularity among the rap
ranks lasts about as long as the life-
span of the fruit fly, but there you
have it. The Beastie Boys, however,
are different from the rest of the rap
rabble. Indeed, they have seized
upon a rock n’ roll truth that goes
back as far as Elvis: take a suc-
cessful black music genre, find some
white people to copy it, and then sell
the whole package to the suburbs.
It’s worked for the King, the Rolling
Stones, the Bee Gees, Madon-
na...stick with the tired and true.

But in addition to being white, the
Beastie Boys are also roughly the
same age as their audience. They
dress like their audience. They talk
like their audience. And after dows-
ing said audience with a six pack or
two of Budweiser, it is probably safe

to say the Beastie Boys even smell
like their audience.

What snotty-nosed fifteen year old
kid could resist? Why, the whole key
to the Beastie Boys is not that they’re
so great they deserve our respect,
but rather that they are so bad, so
normal, so obnoxious, it could be any
of us. (God forbid.) But this should,
of course, make you wonder why
anyone would want to shell out eight
dollars to hear a bunch of middle
class jerk-offs do what you or I could
do better, for free. Wonder indeed.

‘Aw, but where’s your sense of
humor?” you ask. Hey, I’ve got a
sense of humor; its these Beastie
Boys who are lacking in that depart-
ment. The funniest joke they’ve had
was wanting to call their record
“Don’t Be A Faggot.” (Their record
company vetoed the idea, incidental-
ly.) As it stands, ‘License To IIl’’ is
only funny if you’re the kind of per-
son who thinks a belch at the dinner
table is a laugh riot. And if that’s so,
don’t come eat at my house.

But let’s look at the record in ques-
tion. I listened to this whole thing, I
swear it. It wasn’t easy, but all thir-
teen tracks got a listen (although, I
must confess, by side two I began
playing ‘drop the needle’ quite a bit).
Another neat bit of marketing the
Beastie Boys have seized upon is that
fifteen year old kids go wild over
heavy metal, so that’s what much of
this record sounds like. Of course,
even heavy metal occasionally

   

boasts a melody (or at least a riff),
but the Beastie Boys couldn’t be
bothered with technicalities like that

This is a rap record, remember?

The raps concern, almost ex-
clusively, the Beastie Boys and all
that it means to be a Beastie Boy.
They like girls, drink Budweiser, doa
lot of angel dust, carry guns
(although pistols on this record
might also refer to a certain part of
the male anatomy, and vice versa),
hang out at White Castle, watch a lot
of television, and make a lot of
money. The hits are all here, if you
want them. ‘“‘Fight For Your Right”
(‘to party!’’ the Boys scream in a
drunken chant) has become some-
thing of the Buddy Atkins theme song
‘round here; ‘‘Paul Revere”’ is about
the only legitamately funny track on
the record; ‘Slow Ride,”’ with its
calypso horns, is the only one with a
hook; and ‘“‘Rhymin and Stealin’’ is
the only one, for some reason, that I
even liked.

Of course. ‘ecause the Beastie
Boys are such an easy-to-assemble
pop package, it won't be long before
every middle class, drunken, high
school drop-out has a rap record on
the charts. And that means that by
the time the Beastie Boys release
their second record, the appeal! will
have worn off. (See: the Knack) In
the meantime, if you must, find some
poor fool who has already bought this
platter and tape it from him. You can
always erase it ina few months.
