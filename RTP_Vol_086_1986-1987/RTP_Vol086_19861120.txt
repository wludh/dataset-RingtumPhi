The procurement scandals within
the United States Department of
Defense will not be solved until the
public forces Congress and the ad-
ministration to instigate those
changes, said Pentagon watchdog
Dina Rasor in a lecture in Lee Chapel
Monday night.

“It is up to Congress, the politi-
cians and the public pressuring the
politicians to change. I don’t believe
until we change administrations that

~we will have any changes, because
Casper Weinberger is simply not in-
terested in changing the way things
are,” Rasor told an audience of
Washington and Lee students and

munity.

Brandt Wood, the junior class Ex-
ecutive Committee representative,
and Christopher de Movellan,
sophomore class representative, at-
tended an Honor Symposium James
Madison University last Thursday
night.

Representatives from George
Mason University, Mary Baldwin
College, the Virginia Military In-
Stitute, as well as from JMU and
W&L, participated in a panel discus-
sion which was the focus of Honor
Awareness Week at JMU.

Each school was allotted time at

the beginning of the discussion to pre-
sent a brief overview of its Honor
System. According to Brandt Wood,
the other schools were interested in
the single sanction system used by
both VMI and W&L.

Wood stated that the other schools
were also concerned with how aware
the W&L students are of the Honor
System, the extent to which the facul-
ty supports it and how much faith
there is in the Honor System. He ad-
ded that answers were often given
from the White Book, and he attri-
buted a large part of the success of
the Honor System to the fact that it is
completely student run.

Wood’s impressions of the discus-
sion were that VMI and W&L had the

most to share with the other repre-
sentatives because of the single sanc-
tion. Wood noted that VMI’s Honor
System does have the fourth point,
which states that failure to report a
breach of the Honor System is con-
sidered an honor violation.

This, too, was a topic of interest to
the audience because of the problem
encountered by many schools where
students do not report honor viola-
tions. Wood said that W&L does not
have this problem because the
students realize how important the
Honor System is to W&L. “The
students realize that their freedoms
are in jeopardy if honor violations go

More than twenty brothers of
Kappa Sigma fraternity became ill
following Monday’s Thanksgiving
dinner at the fraternity house.
Tuesday night, several brothers
began experiencing stomach pains,
vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea.
Fraternity members and _physi-
cians have attributed the cause of
the sudden illness to either a
highly contagious virus spreading
throughout the house or _ food
poisoning.

Alan Scarisbrick, president of
Kappa Sigma, said he is not sure
what caused the sickness, but
believes it was caused by a virus a

“‘We must take more seriously the
need for education in ethical leader-
ship. There are no substitutes for
directors and managers of moral
stamina,” said Paul, an_ ethics
teacher at a prestigious Virginia
university.

Paul is not a member of the W&L
faculty, but a character in a dialogue
written by Elmer H. Johnson, key-
note speaker for last weekend's
Business Ethics Institute. Johnson,
vice-president and general counsel of
General Motors Corporation, used
the Plato-like technique in his lecture
“The Virtues of Managerial Effec

couple of fraternity brothers picked
up prior to Monday’s meal. He
said if it was anything more than
that, it was probably just a bad
batch of food, and ‘‘not the cook’s
fault.”’

University physician Dr. Fred-
erick A. Feddeman, however,
believes the sickness is ‘‘probably
due to food poisoning.’’ Feddeman
said that the symptoms and the
time period between eating poison-
ed food and showing the symp-
toms, which is usually about thirty-
six hours, fits. He added that some
people are more resistant to it
than others, which is one explana-
tion why some people who ate din-
ner did not become ill.

The number of Kappa Sigma
brothers reporting to the infirmary

tiveness’ on Friday night to il-
lustrate some of the problems ac-
companying the advent of the busi-
ness ethics field.

Johnson, through the discussion of
his characters, pointed out many
questions even business leaders have
trouble answering. For exampl- for
what ultimate purpose does th —r-
poration exist? In the dialogue, Mar-
tin, a chief executive officer, or CEO,
of a major corporation, believes it ex-

ists solely for the maximization of
profits of all stockholders. Conse-
quently, any interference, whether
legal or contractual, that hinders this
purpose should be minimized. In
other words, government and other
checks on big business should be kept

toa minimum

Tuesday night grew to the point
that only the sickest could remain
overnight.

Kappa Sigma food manager Jef-
frey Branflick, who is suffering
from the illness, said he thinks it
is only a virus, and not food
poisoning, causing the trouble. He
said that although he has never
had food poisoning, the symptoms
he is suffering from ‘‘seems like a
basic stomach virus.”

Branflick also said that as food
manager, he works closely with
cook Linda Wooding, and that all
of Kappa Sigma’s food is fresh, for
“she is a very competent cook.”
He also pointed out that Wooding
and two fraternity brothers were
suffering from a virus with the
same symptoms Monday.

Are we to believe this argument,
which some would argue is reflective
of the economic idealogy of the cur-
rent national government? ‘‘No,”’
said Hilary, who in the dialogue is a
corporate law experate at one of the
country’s top law firms. ‘‘Corpora-
tions today have no owners; they
have stakeholders, which include
stockholders, employees, manage-
ment and even the public. Business
has the obligation of protecting all of
its stakeholders, as they all are af-
fected by any decision the company’s
board of directors makes.”’

Whether one holds this view or not,
Johnson's dialogue pointed out many
of the problems associated with large
multi-national corporations

“One of the questions business

profit organization which in-
vestigates waste, fraud and mis-
management within the defense con-
tracting industry. Rasor stated in her
speech that the Project has four ma-
jor guidelines. ‘‘First, we look at
military procurement. It is not the
Project on Foreign Policy, or the
Project on Arms Control. Instead, we
are looking at the defense budget and
spending machine. Second of all, we
are nonpartisan. Third, we are not
going to discuss the strategy of
nuclear weapons, but will look at
nuclear delivery systems. Lastly, I
decided at the beginning that we
won't take classified documents. It’s
against the law, and the Pentagon
would use that to discredit me
against the people inside, my
sources. If I leaked classified
documents, I would show to those
people a basic disrespect for the
security of the country.”

Rasor obtains her information

from a network of ‘‘concerned’’
sources within the defense depart-
ment which she calls the ‘Pentagon
Underground.” She divides those
sources into two categories. ‘‘One I
call the ‘more bucks’ underground,
the ones concerned that we are pric-
ing ourselves out of existence with
weapons, and the other is the ‘less-
bang,’ in the sense that every new
generation of weapon has become so
complex and so expensive that it will
never become realistic on the bat-
tlefield,’’ Rasor said.

The sources include ‘‘the average
airman who sees a spare part that’s
overpriced to men who sit in the
Secretary of Defense’s office. We
have a very elaborate network of how
to get the documentation to us with
me not having to reveal where it
came from.”’

The information is then released to

Comedian Brett Butler performs at Friday night’s New
York Laff Off in General Headquarters.

GM Vice-President uses dialoge to discuss ethics

leaders must ask themselves is ‘Do
we have to be this big to be this
good?’ "Johnson later commented,
“Many companies are simply too
large to be close to their employees
and customers.”’

The dialogue used Japan as an ex
ample of a country whose businesses
place a value on employee-based

management philosophies. Such
philosophies, said the character
Paul, are grounded on the dignity of

the workplace. Employees work in
an atmosphere of teamwork; work

ing conditions are good, and spirit is
high. ‘“‘Consequently, their level of
productivity yields results that can
not be matched by our more ‘results
oriented’ managerial style used in to

day's corporations,’ added charac

ter Paul.

Under the pressure of such a
results-oriented system, Johnson
suggested that managers are forced
to hide problems in the company
from the board of directors, decreas-
ing the efficiency of the company and
increasing the pressures on manage-
ment in an already high job-risk
situation.

Another problem, is that of ac-
countability: who is to blame when
such accidents occur? Johnson, in a
discussion after the lecture, explain-
ed that while Board of Directors and
CEO’s are the persons most responsi-
ble, it is often hard to carry out such

OPINION

The Ring-tum Phi, November 20, 1986

 

Misbehavin’

Two separate incidents occured last Thursday and Friday
night that reflect poorly on the student body. On Thursday
night several students threw a party in the library. On Friday
night at a ‘‘Laff off’ sponsored by the SAB, several students
heckled one of the comedians to a point where she refused to

continue her performance.

The party in the library Thursday night is simply an abuse
of privileges. W&L students are fortunate to have access to
the library 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The rules of
the library concerning food and drinks, pets and talking are
clearly posted. While it is a breech of regulations, students
sneaking cups of coffee and candy bars into the library seems
more justifiable than throwing a keg party.

These students had to go to great trouble to get the keg and
sneak it into the library. Perhaps the thrill of the ‘‘verboten”
enhanced the party atmosphere (the forbidden fruit is
always the sweetest). Whatever the motivation, it is inex-
cusable. The students who threw that party had no intention
of studying, and probably disturbed those students who
wanted to use the library for what it was intended. Students
have the right (and need, some would argue) to let off steam
by partying, but there are plenty of places to party besides

the library.

The incident Friday night at the G.H.Q. involved a comed-
ian and students. The performers did arrive three hours late,
and by the time they started the show, the audience was fair-
ly rowdy. This group of students yelled obscenities and was
generally obnoxious. It doesn’t matter if the students were
drunk or sober. Their behavior is unacceptable. It is reassur-
ing that some apologized for their fellow students behavior,
explaining that W&L students weren’t usually this bad.

These events are isolated cases, but misbehavior is fre-
quent among the student body. Because these students are
enrolled at Washington and Lee, their behavior is often taken
to be representative of the entire student body. If the library
closes during the early hours of the morning or the SAB can-
not offer certain events, the whole W&L community suffers.
Students’ behavior affects everyone at W&L and students
should thik about the consequences of their actions before
they do something of the spur of the moment.

Not the real thing

 

MY VIEW

By Chris Carter

 

Let’s get one thing straight right
now. I am not the voice of a new
generation. I do not wear white se-
quined gloves, and 1 do not sleep
in a high-pressure ‘oxygen chamber
to preservé my beardless complex-
ion. You got it--I’m a Coca-cola
man, always have been and always
will be. When they came out with
that new Coke junk I just knew we
were all going to Hell in a hand-
bag, but thank the good Lord, the
people made their voices heard
and now we all have the Classic
Coke back. A friend of mine told
me recently that when Coke
Classic came back out it was one
of two times in his life that he had
cried. I said I knew what he
meant.

It will come as no surprise to
you then that I’m madder than a
wet hen. What Gerry Darrell has
done is worse than taxation
without representation--they’ve
taken away our Coke!! Not just
from the D-hall or the Co-op, but
everywhere, The nearest Coke is
now at Sweet things or Stop-in.
(Lloyd’s has always been a Pepsi
place-and you always thought it
was just the food.) I don’t know
about you, but at two in the morn-
ing when that paper due the next
day is still three pages from being
a rough draft and nothing will do
but some real honest to God high-
caffeine Coke, Stop-In seems a bit
far to walk when you're used to
going to Reid Hall.

of my best friends are Pepsi-
drinkers. But I don’t like the stuff,
and I don’t like having it forced
down my throat. Put Pepsi
machines on campus; just leave a
Coke machine too. There’s already
two machines in the D-hall, so
there’s no reason one of them
couldn’t be changed and the other
one left.

Not wanting to jump to any con-
clusions before climbing up onto
my high horse here, I’ve asked all
my friends what they think about
the change-over. I have yet to find
anyone who likes it. I was talking
to Gail in the Co-op today when
they were making the change. She
said that not only did she not like
Pepsi, but she hadn’t met anyone
who did. Now Gail’s a lady who’s
pretty in touch with the student
body since she’s probably fixed a
sandwich for everybody on this
campus at least once, so I’d say
we have a fairly scientific poll go-
ing here. The Student Body is in
agreement that Pepsi hurts and we
don’t wantit.

Mr. Darrell is not dumb. He’s
made the change-over just before we
all go home so that there can’t be too
much protest. But he still may not
know what he’s in for. If we can stage
a sit-in in the President’s office over
something as trivial as coeduca-
tion, just think of what we students
may be moved to do in the face of
something as earth-shattering as
this! I suggest that while you’re
home over the break, you write a
long letter to Mr. Darrell telling
him just how you feel about his
criminal behavior, explaining that
if you had wanted the caffine buzz
of wimps you’d have gone to
Hampton-Squidney—and then you
better go out and buy a few cases
of Coke to bring back to school
and get through exams on.

Senior examines press rights

 

MY VIEW
By Timothy McMahon

 

It never ceases to amaze me how
quickly Thanksgiving vacation ar-
rives, and yet, amid the mad rush of
Fall Term, there always seems to be
something that sparks controversy
(or at least scuttlebutt) along the Col-
onade.

Last year, for example, coeduca-
tion and the question of drunken
disregard for the Honor System
made the headlines. This year, how-
ever, we witnessed a new Fall
wrinkle: the headlines made the
headlines.

We have all heard and read enough
about the Ring-tum Phi, what it has
done wrong, and how its stories
should or should not be presented.
The case of the Interfraternity Coun-
cil and its temporary banning of Phi
reporters was the best-known, but

certainly not the only, such instance.

Looking back at the IFC conflict,
both sides had plausible, if not
justifiable, positions. And now that a
somewhat uneasy calm has returned
to our campus, a few observations
seen warranted.

As a member of a fraternity, I
understand the position that no
fraternity, nor organization charged
with governing the fraternities,
wants bad press. This position could
seem even more understandable
when the vast majority of stories and
editorials about fraternities appear
negative and contain factual:errors.
Further, when said stories are writ-
ten by non-Greeks, the impression
could arise that some sort of anti-
fraternity atmosphere exists in the
press.

But I am also a journalism major
and the News Director for WLUR,
and I feel qualified to look at the
situation from a journalist’s position.

The press at times is, yes, ar-
rogant. We have a responsibility to

inform the public, and we become
defensive when anyone tries to block
our access to information which is
vital to that responsibility, especially
organizations representing more
than 60 percent of the student popula-
tion.

The flipside to this argument is
that responsible reporting means ac-
curate reporting. Inaccuracies,
rightfully, should be prevented to the
greatest extent possible, and not only
through access to information, but

’ through careful scrutiny and presen-

tation of all the relevant facts on any
given issue.

Editorials, meanwhile, should seek.
not just to inflame those who may be
in the wrong; they should be an in-
formed and informative interpreta-
tion of facts. Opinions are vital to
editorials, but they must be fully in-
formed opinions.

We claim the right to express our
many and varied opinions. In claim-
ing this right, however, we must be
responsible to the public. The media,
after all, are not just sources of infor-

mation; they are forums for the ex-
change and interplay of opinions
from journalists and non-journalists
alike.

When inaccuracies do occur, the
press should recognize and correct
them. If a person or organization is
wronged by a story or an editorial,
that person should inform the press
of the inaccuracies, and a correction
should be printed/broadcast stating
the past inaccuracy as wrong and
presenting the correct information.
This should be done immediately to
prevent time from giving the inac-
curacy an air of truth.

Do not get me wrong: I do not con-
done press mistakes. No good jour-
nalist does. What I am saying is that
a free press must be allowed to make
mistakes in the pursuit of truth. That
same free press, however, must cor-
rect any and all mistakes and remain
responsibe to the public it serves.
The first is the right we demand; the
= is the responsibility we must

Reader wants more student diversity

 

MY VIEW
By Tom Brickel

 

In reading Dana Bolden’s ‘‘Letter
to the Editor’ last week, I’ve become
convinced that as taboo as the issue
that he raises is, the lack of minority
students, especially of black
students, is a problem Washington
and Lee must address. I use ‘Wash-
ington and Lee’ in the broad sense,
for students and faculty, as well as
administration, play a part in this
problem, for better or for worse. In
the past, it’s been for worse, if one ex-
amines the past relationship between
black and white students. I’m hoping
this is changing, though, and will con-
tinue to improve.

I would like to extend Bolden’s
argument beyond the scope of
blacks, though. Washington and Lee,
in spite of its recent strides in
coeducation, suffers from a lack of
diversity, not only of racial diversity,

To The Editor:

 

 

 

Judging from the remains, there must have
been a number of people having a sloshing good
time in the Smoking Study on Lower Level 3 in
the Library on Thursday night. It was no joke on
Friday morning when the Library custodial staf!
had to clean up spilled beer, melting ice, and dog
poop. Do we have to have Library monitors pa-
trolling the building to insure decent behavior?
Or do we have to close the building to insure de-
cent behavior? Or do we have to close the build-

As a result of this homogeneity, at-
titudes have at times been harsh and
condescending toward those of lesser
economic status. Sometimes this has
only been subtly expressed; at other
times, it has been quite apparent.
Last year’s basketball game against
Roanoke College was my first ex-
posure to such attitudes: in an at-
tempt to insult the fans of the oppos-
ing team, students chanted self-
explanatory phrases such as ‘‘wel-
fare’ and ‘“‘food stamps’’ at them,
among other choice verbal descrip-
tions.

Although they evoked laughs, and
many took these to be harmless at-
tempts at demeaning the enemy,
these words are just slightly in-
dicative of pervasive attitudes. And
when millions rely on welfare and
food stamps for daily food and
shelter, I find the taunts just slightly
disturbing.

Obviously, W&L needs to adjust not
only its attitudes toward blacks and
minorities, but also towards those
less blessed with good fortune and
wealth than we are.

Diversity of race and region are
admirable goals, but I wonder if the
character of this school would
change once these alone are achiev-
ed. The admissions office must ask
itself this: instead of striving for
minorities and non-Southerners in
terms of percentages, won't diversity
be better achieved if economic

variance is considered equally worth
the recruitment effort?

The second point on which I would
extend Bolden’s argument regards
his view that the administration must
effect a change in direction in terms
of black admissions. While this is
true, some administrators have tried
extremely hard to bring diversity to
the school, the foremost being Dean
of Minority Affairs Anece McCloud.
Having discussed this problem with
her, I’ve come to respect her im-
mensely for her dedication to the
issue. It would be admirable if more
administrators followed her lead,
though.

But teachers and students play a
major part in changing attitudes and
school policy as well. Pressure ex-
erted by the faculty could play a
significant role in pressing for more
diversity. It would be in their interest
to do so, for being teachers at W&L,
they didn’t come her to publish, cer-
tainly, but rather, to teach. It should
hardly matter to them the back-
ground of the student, so long as he is
motivated to learn. Diversity can
surely be achieved without sacrifice
to academic standards. If that’s the
case, I can’t imagine any teacher op-
posed to diversity.

Students, though, will play a far
more important role, should change
be desired. The administration is
currently in a Catch-22 situation with
regard to its students: prospective

blacks and minorities see a homog-
enous student body, reflecting back-
grounds often very much unlike their
own, and they’re subsequently un-
willing to become entrenched in
them. It would be analogous to an
average W&L student prospecting
Howard University. I believe most
students would feel uncomfortable in
that situation. This is what the Ad-
missions Office has to contend with,
and if students both black and white
realize this and work to be more
receptive to change, prospective
students may pick up on this feeling
on their visits here.

I agree with Bolden that the lack of
minority students is indicative of
neglect by this school, and a signal
for necessary change. It can be
visibly seen in the composition of the
student body, and we haven't even
begun to touch upon the lack of
minority representation in the ad-
ministration and faculty.

But though I share Bolden’s hopes,
I feel diversity on a wider scale
would the more desirable solution.
Historic will be the day when W&L
can claim to have complete religious,
racial, economic, and regional diver-
sity. In the meantime, it would be ad-
mirable if students, teachers, and ad-
ministrators became more sensitive
and responsible to the needs of
the ENTIRE student body. If this
happens, anything will be possible in
our future.

Control policy

The Washington and Lee Department of Student Health
released their birth control policy. It states that “anyone
wanting to go on birth control pills is to see the school
physician for an exam and a pap smear and the physi-
cian will write a prescription for birth control pills. The
exam is free, but the cost of the pap smear, which is
done at Stonewall Jackson Lab, and the prescription of
birth control pills is the responsibility of the individual.”’

Students are also given the option of going to the
Rockbridge Health Department where you receive an ex-
amination, pap smear, counseling and a year’s supply of
birth control pills for $43.00.

Diaphragms are also fitted by the University Physician
at no cost except the cost of the diaphragm, which the in-

Dehydration and dysentery caused
by bad water are the leading killers
of children in Guatemala, according
to Bruce Herrick. Herrick recently
returned from a three week visit to
the Central American nation.

Herrick, the head of the Economics
department at Washington and Lee,
visited Guatemala this summer with
a five member team sent by the U.S.
Agency for International Develop-
ment.

“They're doing as well as they can
with the limited resources they have,
although it’s at a standard far below
that of the United States’, said Her-
rick, describing the Guatemalan
health care system studied by the
team.

Herrick said about one in five
Guatemalan children die before they
reach their first birthday, and the
average life expectancy is 60 years,
compared to 76 years for the United
States.

een

‘‘Most of the hospitals and doctors
are concentrated in the capital’’, said
Herrick. He added that language bar-
riers, bad roads and a guerilla move-
ment in the mountains have made
good health care difficult.

Bad water, inadequate heating and’
undernourishment contribute to the
poor health of many Guatemalans,
causing upper-respitory diseases
such as bronchitis and pneumonia.
“There have been a quarter million
cases of malaria in recent years, and
malaria often leaves you permanent-
ly dehabilitated, which has a huge
economic impact”’, Herrick said.

“We have urged a focus on health
care of children, a focus on preven-
tive rather then curative medicine.”
said Herrick, who thinks that health
education campaigns, a healthier
diet for children and better pre-natal!
care will improve the situation. Her-
rick said more clinics in the rural
areas of the country are needed, but
cultural differences between the
Spanish-speaking ‘‘landinos”’ and the
native Indians creates problems.
“There are 24 Indian languages, and

Herrick.

Guatemala has been sporadically
ruled by military juntas for the past
thirty years, but an elected president
took office in 1985. ‘‘I think the army
officers aren’t comfortable with run-
ning the country, the burdens of ad-
ministration are difficult, and
they’re not prepared for them,”’ said
Herrick, explaining the Army’s deci-
sion to hold elections.

“The early 1980s were a time of
grim human rights abuses, and
thousands of people were slaughter-
ed,’ said Herrick. International at-
tention to the situation has lessened
political violence in Guatemala, ac-
cording to Herrick.

Herrick said the new president
recently fired a 600 man internal
security force linked to death-squad
activity, but hasn’t moved to pro-
secute Army officers for previous
crimes. ‘He would lose his office if
he did that,”’ said Herrick.

Looking for
year?

Searching for some super music?

Dying to dance the day — and
the night — away?

If so, then be sure to reserve
Saturday, Feb. 7, for Washington
and Lee University’s ninth annual
Muscular Dystrophy Association
SuperDance,

Beginning at 8 a.m., dancers will
fill W&L’s Pavilion to rock to the
tunes of local favorites Covacus;
Spiedel, Goodrich, & Lille; and the
White Animals. The dancing won’t
stop until 18 hours later, at 2 a.m.
Sunday.

Eighteen hours may seem a long
time to kick up your heels, but
previous SuperDances went on
—and on — for 30 hours. Changing
the length from 30 hours to 18
hours was the idea of Fontanne S.
Bostic, the dance adviser.

The business manager at

the party of the

the

school’s print shop, Bostic attended
the Jerry Lewis Telethon in Las
Vegas, where she talked with other
college dance advisers. Most of
them, she said, have opted for
shorter dances in order to attract
more dancers and thus more
money for the MDA.

And SuperDance is one event in
which money is unabashedly the
name of the game. At the Labor
Day telethon, Bostic presented
Jerry Lewis with a $25,000 check,
making W&L the number one per
capita contributor among the na-
tion’s colleges and _ universities,
said W&L SuperDance Co-Chair-
man Tom Thagard.

“But we want to keep doing bet-
ter,’ Bostic said. Last year, the
dance raised more than $30,000
before expenses. The goal this year
is $34,000, which will be raised
through pledges and spectator
tickets. Fach dancer must have a
minimum of $100 in pledges, and
spectator tickets will cost $10
apiece.

One spectator who won't be pay-
ing is Josh Cross of Blacksburg.

 

Josh is the poster child for the
Roanoke District of MDA. Josh,
who suffers from muscular dys-
trophy, tries to attend all the fund-
raisers for MDA in the District.
His presence at past W&L Super-
Dances has inspired dancers to
hold out for just one more song...
and one more...

W&L’s SuperDance began nine
years ago at the suggestion of the
Roanoke District of MDA. Since
then, the school’s ‘‘Longest Party”’
has grown not only in size but
quality. This year’s dance will of-
fer many prizes, including a trip to
the Virgin Islands for the dancer
with the most pledges and a trip to
Washington, D.C., for the dancer
who collects the most cash. Spec-
tators will be able to participate in
other prize drawings.

Those who wish to dance for
“Jerry’s Kids’’ can obtain packets

mation about the SuperDance from

The following suggested party
guidelines were given out at Tues-
day’s Interfraternity Council
meeting.

Do not allow people to drink or
congregate outside of the house.

eHave people monitoring the
party for those who are very
drunk or becoming out of control,

eCard non-brothers at the door.
eHave someone who is 21 serve
the alcoholic beverages.

All monitors should be sober in
case something goes wrong, so a
rational person will be able to han-
dle the situation.

eHave trashcans at the door to
help cut down on trash.

eHave a couple of people stay
after the party to clean up the
yard.

eServe non-alcoholic beverages
at the party.

Serve food at the party.

Collect keys at the door, and
only return them to sober in-
dividuals.

eTurn the music down earlier.

Turn the taps off earlier.

Close the windows and doors of
the house.

eKeep people off the porches or
off the property if they are caus-
ing too much noise. If they persist,
get them into the house or call the
police if necessary.

¢Close parties to brothers, their
dates, and invited guests.

Some of the reasons to follow
these suggested guidelines are:

ODAC makes changes Rasor

 

by MIKE SHADY
.ssistant Sports Editor

 

At the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
erence’s twice-yearly meeting this
past Monday and Tuesday, the
athletic directors of the 13 ODAC
schools approved two of the three
Sections of the sports limitations
proposal. But the most highly
debated issue, the elimination of
all out-of-season practices and
direct coaching supervision was tabl-
ed for next year’s spring meeting.

The athletic directors voted 12-1
in favor of the limitation on the
maximum number of contests or
dates each sport can schedule. The
Starting dates for each of the three
sport seasons were also passed by the
following votes: 11-2 for the fall date
of Aug. 20; 13-0 in favor of the winter
date of Oct. 15; anda close 8-5 for the
Spring season date of Feb. 1.

Due to a lack of input by the in-

question regarding out-of-season
practices was postponed. The com-
mittees were supposed to study
how the limitations would affect
their respective sports and then
base recommendations on their
findings. But not enough information
was available for the athletic
directors to make an official final
vote, said Mark Mandel, sports in-
formation director for the ODAC.

The new regulations will be im-
plemented at the beginning of the
fall sports season in 1987-88.

The maximum number of games
or dates for each sport are: foot-
ball — 10 games; soccer — 22;
basketball — 26; cross country —
9; baseball — 30; women’s swim-
ming — 12; lacrosse — 14; tennis
— 30; and track — 10.

Both soccer and tennis were the
only sports in which the number
was changed from the original pro-
posal. Soccer's schedule was orig-
inally set at 18, but was raised to
22, while tennis’ number was bumped
from 20 to 30.

Bowls bowled over

News item .... Fiesta Bowl officials have offered both Miami and Penn
State $1.2 million to play for the National Championship on Jan. 2,
1987.

News item .... A Cotton Bowl official termed the deal between the
Fiesta Bowl and the two independent universities “prostitution,” and
claims that the deal is bad for college football.

Who is that guy kidding!? Prostitution? Bad for college football?
Please. The only things hurt by the deal are the major bowls, namely
the Orange, Cotton, Rose, and Sugar. For the first time since the BYU
fiasco the National Championship won’t go to one of the teams par-
ticipating in one of the major bowls, and it’s their own fault.

For years the major bowls have monopolized the college football
bowl scene by offering big bucks to the participants on their bowls.
What’s more, the major bowls also have contracts with the major con-
ferences saying that the winner of a certain conference must compete
in a certain bowl. Generally, all this insures that the major bowls will
get the top teams in the nation to play for them on New Year’s day.

This year, it’s different. The two top tanked teams in the nation
are independents and, as such, are not bound to any bowl. Miami and
Penn State are free, as they are every year, to “‘shop their services’’
and sell themselves to the highest bidder. Obviously, because of their
rankings, their “services” are worth a lot more this year.

So the Fiesta Bowl officials, seeing the opportunity at hand, went to
their sponsers and asked for the extra money that would allow them to
bid for the two top ranked teams in the nation. Then, after the deal had
been made, they decided to move the game to Jan. 2. That nifty piece
of marketing made sure that the battle for the mythical College Foot-
ball National Championship will not have to compete for viewers with
the other bowls, whichare played on New Year's Day:~

The Fiesta Bowl officials, seizing the chance of their collective
lifetimes, have beaten the major bowls at their own game, at least for
one year.

Predictably, the officials of the other bowls are unhappy, Would you
be happy if you had been upstaged so thoroughly? The major bowls ex-
pended a lot of effort in an attempt to make sure that they would have
a stranglehold on the best teams (and consequently the most money)
in the nation. Then, just when they thought that they had every
possibility covered, the Fiesta Bowl, Miami and Penn State barreled
through a huge loophole and upset the pat little world of the major
bowls, in the process earning themselves a lot of money.

What we have seen is an example of the free enterprise system in ac-
tion. A group of businessmen (right or wrong, major college football is
business) thought that they had the market monopolized. Then
another group of businessmen came along and through shrewd
negotiations, quick actions, and a little luck, pulled off a tremendous
coup that yanked the carpet from underneath the monopolists.

Prostitution? Bad for college football? I think not. This year, the two
best teams had the option to play wherever they wanted, and they
availed themselves of the opportunity. What’s wrong with that? This
year, the college football establishment'is going to have to take a
backseat to a previously minor bowl. This year, the Fiesta Bow] is go-
ing to cut into the profits of the major bowls, and this has the officials
of the four major bowls seeing red.

finishing third out of all the teams
competing in the Regionals. ‘The
team should be proud of themselves
because they do it, I don’t. Cross
country is a self-motivating event,”’
he said.

Miller also believes that the W&L
men continually got better all season,
while it seemed that their opponents
peaked earlier in the season and then
leveled off.

Miller doesn’t want to make
predictions about the National Cham-
pionships on Saturday. He said that
the caliber of some of the other teams
is not known, and the course is un-
familar, but Miller feels that the
three competing W&L men should
represent themselves well.

Washington & Lee’s women’s team

By JIM LAKE
Staff Reporter

 

Despite an excellent passing game,
the Washington and Lee Generals
closed out the 1986 season with their
worst defeat of the year, a 34-point
shutout by the Gators of Allegheny
College. The loss left W&L with a 2-7
overall record, quite a contrast to
last year’s 7-2 campaign.

Offensively, the Generals produced
some statistics that do not in any way
reflect the final score. W&L recorded
14 first downs, only 3 less than
Allegheny. Quarterback Jon Thorn-
ton closed out his career with what
Fallon called ‘‘a really fine day.”

finished their second season with a
3-6 record, and improvement over
last year’s 1-5 record. The women
finished seventh at the South-
Southeast Regionals. Sophomore
Stephanie Smith finished the season
by leading the Generals with a 28th
place finish in a time of 25: 26.

Miller says that the women’s team
has improved vastly over last year.
They competed with nine women this
year and the only time they dropped
any was when two women didn’t
compete at the Regionals. The
freshmen did a great deal to help out
the young women’s team. Miller said
that it will take a while to get the
women’s team used to winning con-
sistently. Jim Phemister from the
law school helped coach the women’s
team and is gradually taking more of
the load from Miller’s shoulders.

The senior completed 17 of 35 passes
for 203 yards and only 1 interception.
Consequently, many of the W&L
receivers had successful afternoons
as well. Three seniors accounted for
most of Thornton’s completions: the
ODAC’s leading receiver, Randy
Brown, caught 6 passes for 83 yards
to lead the Generals, while Bobby
Wilson had 4 receptions for 57 yards
and Paul Youngman hauled in 3
catches for 33 yards.

Unfortunately, the W&L ground
game can best be described as dis-
mal. The tough footing ‘‘seemed to
play against us when we needed it the
most,” according to Fallon. The
Generals netted only five yards
rushing all afternoon, due mostly to 5

sacks by the Allegheny defense.
Senior Kevin Weaver managed only
45 yards on 18 carries in his final
game asa General.

The Gators started their scoring
early in the game on a 1-yard run by
Ray Konopka with 9:37 left in the
first period. In the second quarter,
Gator running back Curtis Brown
scored his only touchdown of the day
ona 16-yard carry, and the Allegheny
lead stood at 14 at the half.

The third quarter remained score-
less until Doug Carr carried for the
Gators third TD from 21 yards out
with only 2:15 remaining. Ed Taylor

period, and Dan Andrews closed out
the scoring with 5:03 left in the game
ona 2-yard plunge.

Needless to say, Fallon was sad to
see the 1986 season end with a 34-
point shutout. “‘] felt really bad for
the 16 seniors that (ended their
careers) on a losing note.

But then again I’m really proud of
those seniors, because they went
through a senior year that was rather
difficult for them. They hung in
there, and through their leadership, I
think that, although we didn’t have a
winning season, we did have a good
season, in that our attitude was good
from the start to the end, and I think
we got as much out of our people as
we could possibly expect to.”

 

Let’s talk:

Last week, W&L Athletic Director Bill
McHenry announced that the NCAA had
declared Chris Coffland ineligible for fall sports,
because Coffland is enrolled in only 10 credit
hours for this term. This violates NCAA rule 5-1
c, which specifies that an athlete must be enroll-
ed in 12 credit hours during the semester in
which he participates in athletics. As a punish-

sit out as many as seven games next season, the
number of games in which he played this year.

If the rule is applied in this manner, what ef-
fect does it have on a school with three terms, as
compared to one with two?

Well, first of all, the NCAA is saying that
athletes on a trimester system must take 36
credit «sa year, whereas those on a semester
syste eed take only 24. Just how fair is that?

Furwmermore, this interpretation implies that
students at W&L (or any other school on a 12-12-6
calendar), must take a minimum of 12 credit
hours in each of the three terms to be eligible for
varsity athletics. Now, how many of us are going
to take twelve hours next spring? None! There-
fore, in accordance with the ruling in the Cof-
fland case, all W&L spring athletes who have
competed since the adoption of rule 5-1 c were
(and will be) in violation of NCAA rules, and
should be declared ineligible. According to this
ridiculous and asinine interpretation, all W&L
athletes who participate in lacrosse, baseball,
tennis, and outdoor track after the beginning of
the spring term are in violation of NCAA

ment for.this offense, Coffland may be farced to.

 

OPINION

This stupid manner of enforcement is as baffl-
ing to Generals head football coach Gary Fallon
as it is to everyone else. ‘‘I just can’t understand
the NCAA. I know they have their rules and
guidelines to go by and that they have to enforce
them, but I just don’t think that there’s a whole
lot of common sense being used in their deci-
sion,”’

Fallon points out that most universities re-

 

Hey, NCAA! Now is the time to get your priorities straight

athletes second, whose professors would not
even consider passing a failing athlete to
preserve his eligibility, and whose coaches
wouldn’t even bother to talk to a prospect who
didn’t have high enough SAT scores and grades?
As Fallon said, ‘‘Washington and Lee is not in the
practice of doing anything under the table or
anything unethical. In fact, they’ve got a record
that is just untarnished, and for them to even be

quire an-annual course load-of 24-hours,-or-12.per-....-.put..into.this. light, is.an.embarrassment to the

term, whereas W&L demands a minimum of 27
hours, or 12 in each of the first two terms plus
three in the third. (In Coffland’s case, the faculty
agreed to allow him an underload of 10 hours this
term, with the stipulation that he would enroll in
no fewer than 14 hours during the winter, to bring
his annual total to the required 27.) Clearly, W&L
is not below standard; in fact, Washington and

Lee’s minimum exceeds the national re-
quirements.
Another aspect of this is the idea of

Washington and Lee being accused of wrongdo-
ing. Be serious! We all know that the coaches,
fans, and athletes at many NCAA schools have
been found guilty of gambling, score-fixing,
kickbacks, bribery, and even felonies. The use of
steroids and narcotics is far from rare at many
NCAA schools, Gifts to athletes by alumni and
fans, bogus courses, and sub-moronic admission
and grading standards for athletes are reported
regularly.

With violations of this magnitude going on,
why does the NCAA punish a school whose
academic standards are among the highest in

whole institution.”’

The fact that the NCAA would make an exam-
ple of Coffland is in itself amazing. ‘“‘There’s no
question” but that Coffland is one of the most
devoted athletes at W&L, according to Fallon.
It’s so meaningful for him to be able to play foot-
ball,” says Fallon. ‘Because he’s not a pro pro-
spect, (Coffland knows that) he only has one
more year of football, and he certainly wants it
to be a year without any events like this in front
of him.”

The point of all of this is simple: NCAA, get
your priorities straight! Empower various com-
mittees to interpret the rules as they see fit, and
let them decide when an athlete isn’t making
progress towards his degree. And go after
legitimate, serious violations, not petty ones.
When there are clear violations’ act quickly and
forcefully, so that there will never be another
Len Bias. And give Chris Coffland his eligibility
back, immediately. A devoted student-athlete,
his team, and his university have suffered a
severe injustice; don’t do any more damage, and
don’t let this happen to anyone, anywhere, ever
