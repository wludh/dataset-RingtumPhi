Kimbrough dies
after long illness

By MARGARET PIMBLETT
Staff Reporter

 

A memorial service for Professor
Emory Kimbrough Jr., the chairman
of the Washington and Lee sociology
department, will be held in Lee
Chapel at 4:30 p.m. on Friday. Kim-
brough died Thursday, January 8, at
his brother’s home in Clarksville,
Tennessee. He was 52 years old.

A native of Clarksville, Kimbrough
received his A.B. degree in sociology
from Davidson College, and his M.A.
and Ph.D. degrees from the Universi-
ty of North Carolina. He was a
member of Phi Beta Kappa and the
Alpha Tau Omega social fraternity.

Kimbrough joined the Washington
and Lee faculty in 1962 as an instruc-
tor of sociology, and was promoted to
associate professor in 1966. He
achieved the rank of professor in

1969. Kimbrough was named depart-
ment chairman in 1967 and held that
position until his death. Kimbrough’s
courses included general sociology,
American social institutions, the ci-
ty, population, social theory, current
issues in sociology, and organization
theory.

Professor of Accounting Jay D.
Cook; who has taught at W&L since
1953, said, “My wife and I treated
Emory like family, since he wasn’t
married. We traveled with him to
visit family and to see Europe. He
was very close to our two sons.
Emory was a very honorable man,
but was a very private person. He
was difficult to know well, but we
knew him so long we discovered
many things about him.”

Kimbrough was the author of
several articles and monographs, in-
cluding a recent paper comparing

Phi business manager relieved of

SSS eS
By MARGARET PIMBLETT
Staff Reporter

 

Greg Turley, business manager of
the Ring-tum Phi was relieved of his
duties at a special meeting of the
Publications Board Wednesday
afternoon.

The board made its decision after a
discussion of his bookkeeping, ac-
counting and sales practices for the
paper. The meeting was called
following the Executive Committee
meeting Monday night, at which the
Phi's budget report was met with
questions and comments from the
E.C.

Senior Representative Andrew
Caruthers said the ideal ratio should
be 60 percent advertising and 40 per-
cent news copy in the paper, but that
in the last issue, it was more like ten
or 15 percent advertising. ‘‘How can
you afford to put out a paper?” he
said, sey answered that the previous
week’s low advertising ‘‘was based
on, for one thing, one of my advertis-
ing salesmen isn’t working anymore.
Another thing is that it was a slow
week, and we were pressed for
time.”’

He continued, ‘You can look at

some of the other papers during the
year, you can see we've had lots of
advertisements. We’ve had _ the
advertisements to run eight pages,
but haven’t had the news to fill eight
pages.”

Ring-tum Phi Editor Sean Bugg
said last night, ‘‘I can remember one
or two issues earlier in the year when

we.didn’t have enough copy for the .

ads which were sold, but we have had
three or five issues recently when we
had to hold copy because not enough
ads were sold to pay for an eight-
page paper.”’

Caruthers also questioned the
check deposit procedures of the Phi.
Turley said that a deposit had been
made earlier Monday by News
Editor John Pensec. According to
Pensec, ‘I deposited over $2,000
worth of checks. Before break, there
were about $500 worth of checks in
the Ring-tum Phi office.”’

Pensec’s deposit was for $2311.50,

Vice-President Brandt Surgner
said that he had looked over the Phi’s
ledger, in which checks are recorded.
He said, ‘‘We were shaking our heads
because it wasn’t at all up to date. I’d
never seen books kept that way in my
life.”

The billing procedures for local

advertisers was questioned by
Caruthers, who recommended that
the Phi use tear sheets for organiza-
tions and businesses in Lexington. He
said a number of businesses already
owe the Phi money. “‘That’s not just
one week’s issue. Why haven’t they
been sent tear sheets and why
haven’t they paid their bills? You’ve
got $1200 that should be collecting in-
terest. You’re $4000 in the hole right
now. At $667 an issue, it looks like
spring term isn’t coming out.”

Last night after the Publications
Board meeting, Turley said, “I
thought I was doing a good job in
relation to the situation I had at the
beginning of the year, with outstand-
ing bills (from the 1985-86 academic
year) that needed to be collected,
outstanding revenue that needed to
be paid, no money in the treasury,
and no ads salesmen back from last
year to help out.”

Turley said he had not felt pressure
earlier to increase the amount of ads
sales, “but now I was being pres-
sured by the E.C. and the Phi. It was
very sudden. I hadn’t been warned. I
hadn’t been given an ultimatum.”

Publications Board President Sean
Butler, who was not at the special
meeting Wednesday, said, ‘‘We had

It’s highly unlikely for a person to
die from first-time use of cocaine, a
drug and alcohol expert from Char-
lottesville told an audience in Lee
Chapel on Monday night.

But coke is so addictive, said
Daniel J. O'Donnel, that a person
with unlimited access will choose it
ahead of the food and water needed to
survive.

Cocaine is a stimulant that speeds
up the heart and increases blood
pressure, but it’s unusual to have a
fatal reaction from a small dose, said
the director of medical services at
Mountain Wood Treatment Center of
Charlottesville.

The greatest. danger is that it is
highly addictive, he said. Users build
up a tolerance and need more and
more of it. When the coke does not
seem to work any more, the users

The 116th annual celebration of
Washington and Lee’s Founders’ Day
will take place next Monday, bring-
ing with it an abbreviated class
schedule to allow for a special noon
assembly in Lee Chapel.

Founders’ Day was established by
the Board of Trustees of Washington
College, which resolved on the day of
Robert E. Lee's funeral that his
birthday, January 19, should always
be celebrated at the college.

The assembly marks the sixty-
third anniversary of Omicron Delta
Kappa, the national collegiate
honorary fraternity which was found-

O’Donnell, who also is a clinical
associate professor of psychiatry at
the University of Virginia, said he
rarely treated cocaine users who
didn’t have problems with other
drugs, including alcohol.

O’Donnel said he wanted to dispel
two major myths about coke—that it
is not addictive and that is is an
aphrodisiac.

Coke is very addictive, he said, On-
ly nicotine gets into the bloodstream
faster. And although cocaine may
heighten sexual awareness on a
short-term basis, it does not do so for
an extended time.

Although he opposes substance
abuse, O’Donnell did not preach at
all. His talk, which was titled ‘The
Agony and the Ecstasy—Designer
Drugs,’’ examined the effects of
coke, ecstasy nd other popular
drugs. '

Ecstasy, which is a chemically
modified form of amphetamine, was

students to recognize superior
leadership achievements in various
aspects of campus life. Twenty-three
students and four honorary initiates
will be tapped at the convocation, but
their names are kept secret until the
announcement at the assembly.

Most initiates are senior under-
graduates or third-year law students,
but a small number of students are
selected as juniors, The basic re-
quirements for selection, according
to this year's ODK president, Joe
Krastel, are exemplary character;
responsible leadership and service in
campus life including athletics,
government, the media, the arts, and
social and religious activities;
superior scholarship; and genuine

been illegal for about 1% years, he
said. Like cocaine, it is high addic-
tive. It is similar to LSD in that it can
cause hallucinations and ‘‘bad
trips.”

O’Donnell’s lecture was co-spon-
sored by the Alcohol and Health
Awareness Committee at W&L and
Mountain Wood, a treatment center
for drug and alcohol abuse.

Carol Ann Calkins, chairman of the
committee’s education subcom-
mittee, said she was pleased with the
lecture. She said she was thinking
about suggesting to the subcom-
mittee a follow-up discussion with
someone who had gone through a
rehabilitation program and no longer

_ used drugs.

Pensec said, ‘“‘We had been con-

supposed to attend. It was not sud-

OPINION

The Ring-tum Phi, January 15, 1987

 

Tribute

The Ring-tum Phi notes with sadness the death of Emory
Kimbrough Jr., and extends its condolences to Dr.Kim-
brough’s family and to the Washington and Lee community.

Dr. Kimbrough first joined the W&L faculty in 1962 and was
named chairman of the Sociology department five years
later. He taught until leaving Lexington early last Fall. Kim-
brough, a member of Phi Beta Kappa, authored several ar-
ticles in addition to teaching and studied at Oxford Universi-

ty.

A memorial fund which has been set up in Kimbrough’s
name is a fitting tribute to a man who gave so much to the
University.

Social frats

In last week’s Ring-tum Phi, Associate Dean of Students
Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy”’ Atkins was quoted as saying, ‘‘The obliga-
tion of a specific fraternity is to get as many people as possi-
ble to stay in Lexington and study. What the hell do you want
to do, party five days a week?”

Atkins, class of ’68, was a member of the Student Service
Society, a forerunner of Student Recruitment, the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon social fraternity and the Mongolian Minks.

The University’s Policy Statement on Fraternities, con-
tained in the 1986-87 catalog, states that ‘‘Social fraternities
at Washington and Lee are a valuable and integral part of
both the University and Lexington communities; as such,
fraternity chapters have important privileges, as well as
responsibilities to those communities.”

The key phrase is ‘‘social fraternity.”’

Atkins’ quote leads us to believe that he views fraternities
as academic study halls, not social outlets for W&L students.
This shows a lack of understanding of both the University’s
and the fraternities’ functions.

The University is the academic institution in student’s
lives. It is the responsibility of that institution to stimulate
the undergraduate’s intellectual and academic growth. If
W&L is not capable of fulfilling this job, then it is not the high
caliber school it is considered to be.

Fraternities at W&L provide a much needed social outlet
for students; a walk through Lexington will reveal very little
in the way of post-classroom relaxation. This is a problem af-
fecting all who live in Lexington, professors as well as
students.

While the Student Activities Board organizes Fancy Dress,
Wednesday night concerts in the GHQ in addition to other
concerts throughout the year, it is both unreasonable and
unrealistic to expect it to provide the bulk of W&L social ac-
tivity. Fraternities pick up the slack in the social schedule
and without them the majority of weekends would be devoid
of organized social activities.

Fraternities perform another service by acting as a con-
duit by which bonds of brotherhood and friendship are form-
ed, bonds which cannot be solidified while playing a
“‘charade.’’ Whenvever a fraternity sponsors an event, social
or charitable, such as the recent IFC food drive, it not only
gives brothers a feeling of accomplishment and pride as a
group, as well as providing a valuable service to the com-
munity, it is valuable PR for the University. Or is this a
charade, too?

Obviously fraternities have an obligation to the university
and to Lexington. But to say simply that students need to be
watched to make sure they study is doing a disservice to,
among others, the Admissions Office, which surely does not
admit students that it feels need to be watched.

Remember, “‘All work and no play make Jack a dull boy.”

Student says ‘truth’ hard to discern

 

MY VIEW
By Jennifer Spreng

 

The headline for the front-page
Richmond Times-Dispatch story on
Jan. 11 read, “Reports say CIA
operated illegally in aiding contras.””

My question is: Is anyone really
surprised?

Quite frankly, I’m not.

I haven’t really followed the

Iran/Contras/CIA/Regan/North-etc.
fiasco very closely. When I was in
high school, I used to get extremely
concerned about every little potential
scandal. I used to study all of the
reports in newspapers and news-
magazines in order to figure out the
truth. I was quite the little activist.

I guess I’ve really changed in that
respect.

To be very blunt about it, I am no
longer interested in the truth about
the Iran deal or any other such silly
charade. I think the whole concept of
impeaching President Regan is very
amusing, I really wish we could just
sweep all of this garbage under a rug
somewhere and forget about, it, with
the warning to whoever organized
the fool’s errand that it had better
never happen again.

I really don’t think that the truth
will ever be discernable. The more I
try to follow this business, the more I
realize that the whole thing has total-
ly been blown totally out of propor-
tion. Democrats are trying to bring
down the Republicans. Republicans
are desperate to shift the blame to
anybody but tneir major Presidential
candidates. Part of the problem is

that nobody’s interested in any truth
that doesn’t serve his purpose.

So I have to ask this question: Does
any truth exist? I doubt it. There is
certainly no truth that any govern-
ment commission will be able to fer-
ret out, no matter how much they
swear they know what really happen-
ed. The liberal use of the Fifth
Amendment alone makes that an im-

possibility.

The real problem is the nature of
evidence itself. Imagine a number of
witnesses to a car wreck at a four-
way stop. One says that the yellow
car was at fault. The other says that
there was no yellow car. Another
remembers serious injuries and lots
of blood. Another doesn’t wish to ad-
mit to himself that his jaywalking
caused the accident, so he describes
a head-on collision, that won’t make
him feel guilty. A fifth witness

couldn’t watch as victims were being,
removed from the cars, so he reports
that no one was hurt.

Lies? Not at all. Witnesses in that
situation believe that they are telling
the truth. Yet, what is the truth? It is,
a difficult problem, yes?

All of this speculation has been’
causing me to question much of what
I see and hear. If the facts are all
relative anyway, who cares what
they seem to mean. No matter how
conclusive evidence appears, there is
always another interpretation. Cer-'
tainly in those situations, it becomes
exceedingly dangerous to becor
overly judgemental about any’
even a slightly befuddled presi
who’s maybe an easy mark. I
the only healthy policy is to as
the best of everyone, and hope
eventually it does not bec:
necessary to believe the worst.

Rasicm is not confined to the south

 

MY VIEW
By Jeff Kelsey

 

I read with a great deal of interest
Tom Brickel’s ‘‘My View”’ last week
concerning the Howard Beach inci-
dent. I too followed the events of this
tragedy with a sense of outrage and
shame that such senseless violence
can occur in this nation. Yet there
was another event connected to the
Howard Beach incident which I found
equally disturbing. New York Mayor
Ed Koch, when commenting on the
incident, said he expected such
things in the Deep South, not in New
York. As a resident of that particular
region, I was incensed to think that
Koch could make such a slanderous
comment especially when the pro-
blem occurred in his backyard, not
mine. After all, Koch is an experienc-
ed politician, a man who controls a
city budget which is greater than the
Gross National Product of most na-
tions of the world. One would expect
a little more tact and a greater sense
of reality from such a man, yet Koch
demonstrates no such tact and

possesses a blatant disregard for the
reality of the situation. Racism is not
simply a regional problem but a pro-
blem built into all aspects of our
society. Blacks, Jews, orientals,
hispanics and every other ethnic
group have experienced their share
of bigotry throughout this country.
Koch evidently chooses to ignore
racism in other sectors, focusing in-
stead on the traditional scapegoat for
racial tensions, the South.

No doubt, many of you are thinking
that Koch’s comment was essentially
harmless and only my wounded pride
goads me into attacking him so.
While indeed my sense of honor did
spur me to write this article, there is
also something inherently dangerous
in Koch’s comment. First, the
Howard Beach incidenf represents a
senseless act of violence which oc-
curred simply because Michael Grif-
fith and his friends were black. In
responding to the situation Koch
seems equally eager to condemn peo-
ple simply because of demographics.
How can he really be surprised at the
Howard Beach affair when he holds
such biases himself? I wonder where

    

Mayor Koch gets his information
concerning Southern attitudes living,
as he does, well above the Mason-
Dixon line? I do not recall seeing any
lynchings or beatings at home over
break nor would I expect such oc-
currences as commonplace. Perhaps
the spirit of the season simply in-
fected me so I failed to notice the
overt racism which Mayor Koch
knows exists in my hometown.

Also, besides illustrating Mayor
Koch’s brased opinion his comments
perpetuate false ideas about
southern life. The condescending
tone of his comment reflects the at-
titude that the North holds a moral
superiority in race relations over the
South, To say that such an attitude is

hypocritical is a gross understate-
ment, especially in wake of what hap-
pened at Howard Beach. Koch seems
to have an ‘‘Easy Rider’ image of
southerners where we all drive
around in pick-up trucks, chewing
tobacco and shooting hippies for fur. ,
To perpetuate such attitudes
magifies regional differences a
does nothing to solve the problem-
the Howard Beach affair.

I would not be hypocritical er.
to suggest that racism no longer
ists in the South; however, for N
Koch to imply that such w.
violence is commonplace or expe eu
in the South is an insult which cannot »
be taken lightly.

Senior callsIFC revisions‘an embarrassment’

Leanne ee

TO the Editors:

The revised IFC constitution discussed in
Samuel Foley’s article in the January eighth Phi
should stand as an embarrassment to Wash-
ington and Lee.

While no one can deny the problems of poor
scholarship and possible alcohol abuse that the
new rules attempt to correct, the willingness of
Dean Atkins and the Alcohol Awareness Com-
mittee to side-step the ethics of proper procedure
in search of a solution is disturbing,

The method of forcing through revisions to the
constitution by threatening even stricter sanc-
tions from the Alcohol Awareness Committee if
the new rules are not passed is, plain and simply,
coercion. This has no place in a supposedly self-
governing fraternity system.

And what of these stricter rules that are being
held over the heads of the fraternities? If we
assume Dean Atkins’ and the AAC’s intentions
are legitimate, we then, naturally, assume that
the purpose of these rules is to impose no more or
no fewer restrictions than needed to correct the
problem. If this is the case, they are being
remiss in their duty to offer a compromise, as
Jimmy Holmes’ comments suggest they have.
Could it be that the severity of the rules with

 

 

which the fraternities are being treated come not
from the necessity of a solution to any problem,
but rather from the need for a crowbar with
which to force the desired outcome of a ‘‘vote’’?

The introduction of these sorts of underhanded
politics into the important decision making in
which the IFC has been involved over the past
few months will make the final vote little more
than (to borrow Dean Atkins’ phrase) a “‘stupid
charade.”

Finally, to answer Dean Atkins’ question, no,
most students at Washington and Lee do not feel
the need to party five days a week. But it is possi-
ble, sir, that an objection to the revisions could
legitimately come from another desire. Some-
where at the heart of honor is autonomy, We can
see this in the simplicity of the guidelines that
General Lee laid down for student conduct.
Although the gentlemanly ideal that Lee put
forth is not always met these days (as it was not
in his), its continued existence and support is an
integral part of this university. It is what brought
many of us to Washington and Lee in the first
place, and it is the thing with which most of us
would like to leave.

Mark Trainer '87

Frats are more than parties?
To the Editors:

The “stupid charade’ we have been playing
for years appears not to be that of fraternity life,
but rather in Dean Atkins’ perception of it.

Social life is hardly the only thing that frater-
nities provide. Has Dean Atkins ever heard of
Community Service Projects, Intramurals, or
any of the other activities of fraternities? Hov
quickly has fraternal participation in such
worthwhile causes as assisting the flood victims
and organizing blood drives been forgotten?
Neither of which, by the way, involved parties of
any sort.

Dean Atkins seems to forget that like the rest
of the student body, fraternities are comprised of
real human beings. We eat, sleep, breathe, study
and yes; we even sometimes party. But if we
were to party as much as Dean Atkins implies,
none of us could fulfill even the most minimal
academic standards at W&L (3 days a week is
quite sufficient).

It was a hard decision to speak out against
such an eloquent argument from a Dean of an in-
stitution of higher learning, but if we follow Dear,
Atkins’ demands, soon we may not be able to
take enough time off from studying to go to class.

Peer counseling to begin

 

By STACY MORRISON
Staff Reporter

 

Peer counselor training has been
completed, and will begin next week,
according to Dr. James Worth, uni-
versity psychiatrist.

The new program, similiar to peer
counseling groups at other univer-
sities, is a new idea for W&L. ‘‘The
idea has been in the back of my head
for a long time,” said Worth, but he
gave peer counseling program
stronger consideration after assum-
ing the chairmanship of the subcom-
mittee on counseling in the Alcohol
Awareness group. Worth said, ‘I
asked myself, ‘How can W&L provide
for students who have questions, pro-
blems and needs dealing with drugs
and alcohol?’ ”’ He concluded that a
great number of students would feel
uncomfortable setting up an appoint-

ment with a professional psycholo-
gist but hopes students will see the
peer counselors as ‘low-risk, no
titles, not employed by the universi-
ty” and easier to confide in. Another
plus, added Worth, is that the
counselor’s receive no compensation
which creates ‘‘a greater potential
for trust.”’

However, the peer counselors are
“not mini-psychiatrists. They are in-
tended for one, two, or three visits,”
said Worth.

The counselors main job “is to
listen, to assess whether it would be
good for them (the students) to see a
professional member of the staff and
to act as temporary relief,’ Worth
said.

The counselors will be available, or
on call, twenty-four hours a day. A
student can reach a counselor in

 

 

Washington and Lee University
has received a gift valued at more
than $600,000 from the late John G.
Hamilton, a 1932 graduate of the
university. The gift, made shortly
before Hamilton’s death, will be used
to create a named endowment for the
support of Washington and Lee’s
Reeves Center for Research and Ex-
hibition of Porcelain and Paintings.

Opened in 1982, the Reeves Center
houses Washington and Lee’s collec-
tion of ceramics and Chinese export
porcelain and many of the universi-

ty’s paintings. It also serves as an .

important study center for students
interested in the decorative arts.

“This major addition to Washing-
ton and Lee’s endowment will pro-
vide the means to improve and ex-
tend the excellent programs for
students in the Reeves Center,”’ said
W&L President John D. Wilson in an-
nouncing the gift.

Hamilton, who died Nov. 14, was
the former chairman of the board of
Redpath Inc., based in Denison, Tex-
as. He was long involved in the pro-
e-ems sponsored by the Reeves

er. He lived in Cincinnati for

1y years and was a resident of
Buca Raton, Fla., at the time of his
death.

several ways. Posters and cards that
have each counselors name and
number will be circulated around
campus, Worth said. Also, a student
can go to Carol Calkins’ office and
get the name and number of a
counselor from her. A third manner
of reaching a peer counselor is a
hotline, an idea thought of by the
students, said Worth. The hotline will
be open 7-11 p.m. daily and will allow
for a greater amount of anonymity.
Worth has high hopes for the hotline.

Worth’s goal for the peer counsel-
ing program is to have a peer coun-
selor from every fraternity, and to
have them available in Gaines Hall
and Woods Creek Apartments. ‘‘The
hope is that we can have people out
there who are recognized as brained,
caring people.”’

Tien

Dr. H.C. Tien, president of Chinese™

Computer Communications, Inc. .of
Lansing, Michigan, will present a
lecture entitled “PX Computerized
Chinese: The Rosetta Stone of the
U.S.-China Communications”’ in Nor-
then Auditorium in the University
Library on the campus of Washing-
ton and Lee University. The lecture,
at 8 p.m., January 15, is free and
open to the public.

Tien is an interdisciplinary scien-
tist who is a medical doctor, psy-
chiatrist, neurologist, linguist, and
computer expert. Among his ac-
complishments in the computer field
is a Chinese word processing system
that can produce some 20,000 Chinese
characters throught simple touch-
type processing on a standard key-
board.

Tien’s work represents a major
breakthrough that may have a far-
reaching effect on China’s economy
and trade, as well as on its still untap-
ped scientific and technological
potential. The lecture will be directed
not only to those with special concern
for computers, but also to those in-
terested in our future relations with
China itself, and especially to the
business community that may well
become the real pioneer in the search
for better understanding.

Murphy tells IFC ideas
for ‘rennaisance’

By SAMUEL FOLEY
Staff Reporter

The horizon is much brighter for
the future of fraternities on the
Washington and Lee campus. This
was the message conveyed by Col-
onel Paul Murphy, the president of
the Alumni fraternity council.

Murphy told the IFC represen-
tatives that they can expect more
support from the alumni. Murphy
apologized for the fact that fraternity
alumni support has been so weak in
recent years and said that he and the
council were trying to catch up as
fast as possible.

He also told the representatives
that the council would seek to get the
fraternities national leaderships to
give more help to the houses at
Washington and Lee.

Murphy outlined some of the goals

he would like to achieve in 1987
—strengthen the housing corpora-
tion’s participation with the frater-
nities, meet with university officials
to exchange views on the fraternity
system and encourage individual
houses to begin to develop a
renaissance program.

Murphy said, ‘‘The houses are in a
sad state of repair and need serious
renovation.”’

Two methods for funding this
renaissance were discussed at the
meeting; one would entail a universi-
ty fund-raising campaign the other
would involve a limited partnership
tax shelter deal similar to the one
that was used to rebuild the Phi Gam-
ma Delta house.

IFC President Chris Saxman said,
“If we do it right from the beginning
it could be a great success. It could
really strengthen the fraternity
system at W&L.”’

Travel discount offered

Dallas, December 22, 1986 — Col-
lege students traveling to Atlanta
from any destination served by
Trailways Lines, Inc. and _par-
ticipating carriers in the United
States, for the Martin Luther King,
Jr. Student Conference, will receive
a 30 percent fare discount when
traveling round-trip, announced
Robert Buschner, vice president of
marketing for Trailways Lines, Inc.

With a current student I.D. card,
college students may purchase a
Trailways ticket anytime from now
until the January 17 conference, but
tickets must be used for travel be-
tween January 14 and 22.

“This conference, sponsored by the
United States Student Association,
the Martin Luther King, Jr. Federal
Holiday Commission and the Martin
Luther King, Jr. Center for Non-

Violent Social Change, has been
designed to work with college
students with programs that com-
memorate the life of Dr. King and the
civil rights movement,’’ said Tom
Swan, president of the United States
Student Association.

‘The conference is a wonderful op-
portunity for students from around
the country to gather and discuss
some of the national and social issues
that are affecting their lives. It also
provides them with the opportunity
to voice their opinions in hopes of
making a difference in the world one
day. The Trailways Corporation has
always been a strong supporter of the
King Center, in Atlanta, and the crea-
tion of a Federal Holiday commemo-
rating the life of Dr. King. The 30%
discount fare they are offering to
students to attend this conference is
another example of that support.”

posium at Washington and Lee entitl-
ed ‘‘The procurement of America’s
Defense: 1986 and Beyond.”’ The

 

 

 

symposium brought together experts
from the Defense Department, Con-
gress, the media, and the defense in-
dustry to talk about the problems of
Pentagon waste.

Falk and two other students—
Steven Pockrass, '87, and Timothy
McMahon, ’87, later published
transcripts of the symposium.

to womanhood is captured in the col-
lection of photographs by Sally Mann
to be exhibited January 12 to
February 12 in Washington and Lee
University’s duPont Gallery.

In the collection, ‘‘ ‘Sweet Silent
Thought:’ Photographs of Twelve-
Year-Old Girls,’’ Mann strives to
depicit the ‘‘changing image of the
young women in society.”’

Mann’s portraits of adolescent
girls have been exhibited around the
country, including one-woman shows
at the Martin Gallery in Washington,
D.C., the Focus Gallery in San Fran-
cisco, and the Marcus Pfeifer
Gallery in New York.

The photographs were the topic of
a seminar last year at Southern
Seminary Junior College in Buena
Vista entitled ‘‘Images of
Adolescents: Aesthetics and Ethics.”’

“Sweet Silent Thought’ will be
published as a book in the spring of
1988 by David R. Godine. The book is
made possible by a grant from the
Winston Foundation.

One photograph from the collection
is featured in a major publication
and travelling show entitled
“Mothers and Daughters,’’ spon-
sored by Aperture Foundation of

Swimmers slide by Briar and R-MWC

Sweet Briar team to beat this season in ODAC

By MATHEW HORRIDGE
Staff Reporter

 

So far, 1987 has proven to be a year
in which hard work pays off and the
good guys win.

The squeaky-clean Nittany Lions
toppled the Miami Hurricanes for the
national championship. A battered
Washington Redskins team man-
handled the Chicago Bears. Add to
that list the Washington and Lee
women’s swimming team.

Generals ‘physically’ beaten by
Greensboro after Invitational win

3y MIKE SHADY

Assistant Sports Editor

 

The Washington and Lee basket-
ball team was defeated. It’s as sim-
ple as that.

Coming off a weekend in which the
team won the W&L Invitational Tour-
nament, the Generals lost to an ex-
tremely talented UNC-Greensboro
squad by the score of 73-61 Tuesday
night in North Carolina.

“We got beat, physically,” said
head coach Verne Canfield. ‘“‘They
havea very fine ball club with a lot of
nice players. They are a team that
wants to go Division II next year and
they are only a few players away
from that.

‘‘We didn’t get the outside shooting

we needed and the game was very up °

tempo — we can’t play that way,” he
said.

W&L, after two consecutive games
of shooting 50% or better from the
field, could manage only a meager
39% against Greensboro. Senior Jef-
ferson Harralson, the game’s leading
scorer with 24 points, and junior
Steve Hancock were a combined 12 of
36.

“We were intimidated,” said Can-

field. ‘‘They put a couple of our early
shots into the bleachers and we tried
to adjust our shots instead of taking it
right at them.”

Canfield attributed the poor shoot-
ing performance to the Greensboro
deferise. ‘They totally took it too us
defensively,”’ he said. W&L trailed
by nine at halftime, 38-29.

A main concern for Canfield after
the game was not the General’s out-
side woes but the physical well-being
of his players, especially for tonight’s
game with archrival Roanoke Col-
lege. “‘We are physically bruised and
banged up,”’ he said.

The loss stops the General’s win-
ning streak at three games after an
impressive showing in last week-
end’s tournament.

W&L held off Newport News Ap-
prentice in the opener 85-78. The
Generals led by as many as 13 at one
point and were paced by Harralson
and Hancock who scored 25 and 22
points respectively. Senior Fred
Bissinger also played an outstanding
game scoring nine points on 4 for 5
from the field, dishing out four
assists, and holding Newport News at
bay late in the game with two key
jumpers.

Turnovers were the difference be-
tween the two teams as Newport
News coughed it up 23 times. The
Generals took much better care of
the ball, totaling only 15 pastries.

The win slated W&L in the finals
versus Philadelphia College of Phar-
macy and Science, a 63-62 overtime
winner over Kean College. Philadel-
phia was anything but impressive;
however, they had a few surprises for
WA&L in the final.

With the Generals playing an ag-
gressive man-to-man defense, a less
talented Philadelphia ran a motion
offense that confused W&L. Revers-
ing the ball quickly around the
perimeter, Philadelphia was able to
run backscreens and hit players
down low for easy baskets. Even with
their success in the paint, Phila-
delphia still trailed 31-27.

“Tt was an offense we’ve never fac-
ed,”’ said Harralson. ‘‘In the second
half we started anticipating and com-
ing away with steals.”’

“We played two different zones and
just called attention to what they
were doing,” said Canfield. ‘‘Credit
to them, but we didn’t take anything
away defensively.”

Wé&L hopes to shipwreck Maroons

By JIM LAKE
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee basket-
ball team will face perennial rival
Roanoke College tonight at 7:30. The
Generals’ expect one of their largest
crowds of the season for tonight’s
game at the Warner Center.

The Maroons, with all five of their
starters back from last season, were
ranked fifth in the nation in Division
III before losing their last two
games. Generals’ head coach Verne
Canfield describes Roanoke as
“smooth, poised, and experienced.”’
The Maroons come into tonight’s con-
test with a 6-2 overall record, in-
cluding a ten-point loss to NAIA
member Anderson College in their
last game. Tonight’s game will be the
conference opener for Roanoke, as
well as the Maroons’ first game in
over five days.

Roanoke leads the ODAC in team
defense, allowing an average of only
61 points per game. Individually, the
Maroons feature the ODAC’s leading
rebounder, junior forward James
Pennix, who averages ten boards per
outing. Their leading scorer is
sophomore forward Taylor Livic, a
56% field goal shooter who averages
13.5 points per contest.

While Roanoke may have the best
defense in the conference, their of-
fense is dead last, with an average of
less than 69 points per game. The
Maroons, who shoot 46% from the
field, are the worst free throw
shooting team in the ODAC; they are
only 69% from the line for the season,
despite 83% shooting from junior
guard Bill McCormick.

Canfield expects Roanoke to come
out in a box-and-one defense, with
one player guarding senior forward
Jefferson Harralson in a tight man-
to-man and the rest of the Maroons
playing a zone. Because of tight

coverage on  Harralson, the
Generals’ head coach says that
“Steve Hancock must score” for
W&L to be successful.

The Generals are still recovering
from a very physical game against
UNC-Greensboro. Canfield says that
junior forward Gary Schott will pro-
bably be hampered by a thumb in-
jury for the rest of the week, but
sophomore guard Manny Klump
should be over a sprained ankle in
time for tonight’s contest.

Off the court, tonight’s game is ex-
pected to feature the return of ‘‘The
Unknown Fans,”’ who always seem to
show up for the Roanoke game. Can-
field says that he is looking forward
to the enthusiastic support of ‘‘those
guys with the bags.”’ The Generals’
head coach says that his team “‘real-
ly appreciates the support’’ that the
student body has given throughout
the season. ‘‘It really means a lot to
the players,’’ he says.

ed off the biggest upset of 1987 by
edging Sweet Briar, 71-68, ina double
dual meet last night at Cy Twombly
Pool.

Freshman Debbie Grove said the
victory was ‘‘definitely sweet.”’

The meet’s outcome was decided
by the last race of the night, the 400-
yard freestyle relay. The Generals’
team, made up of sophomores Eliza-
beth Miles and Nancy Whalen and
freshmen Kris Amoroso and Grove,
soundly defeated the Sweet Briar en-
try.

The Vixens have been the con-
ference champions for the last four

years, and W&L head coach Page
Remillard was very happy with the
victory.

“Our game plan was to swim our
butts off,’’ Remillard said, ‘‘and if
they made a mistake, we'd be there.”

The Generals also faced the Ran-
dolph-Macon Woman’s College team
in last night’s meet and soundly
defeated the Wildcats, 105-37.

The Generals had a very sound
night, racking up seven first-place
finishes, eight second-place finishes
and five third-place finishes.

Miles had the best individual effort
of the evening for the Generals,

 

 

winning the 200-yard freestyle, the
200-yard backstroke, and the 500-
yard freestyle races.

Freshman Heather Logan record-
ed victories in the 100- and 200-yard
breast stroke races, and Whalen won
the 100-yard freestyle race.

Freshman Beth Stutzmann placed
third overall in the one meter spring-
board competition, and sophomore
Alston Parker placed second on the
three-meter springboard.

The men’s and women’s teams tra
vel this weekend to face Frostburg
and Georgetown.

Junior Lou Trosch wins the opening tip in Friday’s game against Newport News
Apprentice. The Generals went on to win 85-78.

Canfield’s plan for the second half
worked as the Generals packed the
defense inside and forced Philadel-
phia to bomb away. After shooting
41% in the first half, Philadelphia
plummeted to 35% in final period.

Stamina also played a large role as
Philadelphia only dressed nine

players for the game. Towards the
end of the contest, the Generals
began to wear Philadelphia down and
pulled away for the tourney cham-
pionship.

“Everybody feels that we can win
close games now,”’ said Harralson.

‘‘We have that winning attitude. We
not only come into a game thinking
we can win but expecting to win.”
Hookshots: Harralson and Hancock
were named to the All-Tournament
team... The Generals have a three
game homestand before embarking
ona three game road trip...

Heisman Trophy proves to be Testaverde’s - downfall

I know everyone’s sick of reading about college foot-
ball, especially what Sports Illustrated called the ‘‘In-
creda Bowl,” the big one, the National Championship,
the bow! to end all bowls. But here’s one more column
on the 1987 Fiesta Bowl. After this, you can forget about
college football until next season (or at least until
spring practice starts).

I didn’t hate Miami in September. In fact, I admired
their exciting offense, their spectacular quarterback,
and their underrated defense. Sure, coach Jimmy
Johnson ran up the score on Notre Dame in 1985, but
every football coach in America dreams of beating up
on the Irish. And besides, Tennessee returned the favor
on New Year’s night of 1986. So there was really no
reason to hate Miami, until...

The December 1 issue of The Sporting News had a
cover story on Vinny Testaverde that revealed an awful
lot about the Miami QB. According to TSN, Testaverde
was committed to winning the Heisman Trophy. In fact,
he wanted it so badly that he ‘‘spent preseason practice
wearing a shirt decorated with a picture of the trophy,
just to keep his mind focused.’’ Miami kicker Mark
Seelig told TSN that Testaverde keeps a picture of Doug
Flutie in his Miami apartment with the words ‘‘Heis-
man Trophy” in the middle.

Miami fans will quickly respond, what’s wrong with
that? And, to an extent, they’re right. It’s great for
someone to want to succeed. But a team should be an
athlete’s first priority. Testaverde seemed to want to be
great for all the wrong reasons. Maybe my concept of
sports is outdated, but I always thought of college foot-
ball as a team sport, with all the players working
together toward a common goal: the national cham-
pionship. I find it very difficult to admire a football
player (or any athlete, for that matter) who is playing

for individual honors. Testaverde seemed to be so
obsessed with winning the Heisman that, for him, the
Fiesta Bowl would be purely an after-thought (And,
judging from the way the Miami QB played, it may well
have been).

But my faith in college athletes was rewarded. Twen-
ty pages later, in the very same issue of The Sporting
News, a story on Penn State runningback D.J. Dozier
reassured me that there is at least one team-oriented
athlete left in America. TSN called Dozier ‘‘the calm in
the middle of a media storm.”’ In the Nittany Lions’
first nine wins, he gained only 657 yards ‘‘because (head
coach Joe) Paterno doesn’t believe in piling up an in-
dividual’s statistics at the expense of the team.’’ And
Dozier seemed to agree with this philosophy; he told
TSN that “I didn’t come to Penn State to win a Heisman
Trophy. I came in the hopes we could win a national
championship.”

Skip to the night of January 2, 1987. For the rest of his
life, Testaverde will have to remember his ‘‘decision.”’

Hurricane tailback Alonzo Highsmith has already
gained 120 yards on only eight carries, and Penn State
has been dropping everybody to cover the Miami
receivers, Miami backup quarterback Geoff Torretta
told SI that, ‘‘from the five yard line, Alonzo could have
flown over.’ The head coach says, ‘Run it.” The assis-
tant coaches say, ‘‘Run it.”” The backup QB says, “Run
it.” But Testaverde wants to pass. Later, Johnson
would tell SI, ‘‘We were all very frustrated, but we gave
in. He wanted to throw it, and he felt good about it, so we
went withit.”’

Skip to January 5, 1987. See Testaverde, holding his
Heisman, looking at the sports page from Saturday
morning, staring at the headline, ‘“‘Penn State tops

Miami,”’ imagining what could have been. Now see
Dozier, standing with his teammates, holding their
NCAA National Championship Trophy, looking at the
very same headline, remembering what was.

Maybe, just maybe, if Testaverde hadn’t been so
damn cocky, he would've listened to his coaches and
given the ball to Highsmith on second and goal, and
Penn State would have been denied a national title once
again. Instead, Testaverde was sacked for a six yard
loss, forcing him to throw on third down. After an in-
completion, the ‘‘Increda Bow!”’ boiled down to one ‘‘In-
creda Play,” in which the athlete that The New York
Athletic Club called ‘best college football player in
America’ threw his fifth intercention of the night, a
perfect spiral which landed right in the hands of the
receiver — Penn State linebacker Pete Giftopoulos.

Every once in a while, an event in sports proves to be
more than just a game; athletics can provide a wonder-
ful allegory, a valuable lesson for us all. As Sports Il-
lustrated pointed out, the 1987 Fiesta Bowl featured a
team of athletes working together with excellent
coaches to defeat a stronger opponent. It seems that the
“Increda Bowl"’ lived up to it’s billing, in that it has
done more than entertain us; it has also taught us a
lesson about the value of dedication and teamwork.

So congratulations to D.J., and to Coach Pa, and to all
the rest of the Nittany Lions, You've earned it, And con-
grats to Vinny, too, for winning the Heisman. But just
one question, Vinny: how does it feel? I bet D.J. doesn’t

envy you a bit, but I bet you're just a little jealous of
him, aren’t you? To my way of thinking, individual
honors are nice, but I'll go along with Dozier and Pater

no; I’drather have a National Championship.

Paul Newman hustles a hit

“The object of 9-Ball is to sink the
balls in consecutive order and then
drop the nine. A player can make
eight trick shots, blow the nine, and
lose. Then again, he can make the
nine on the break—and win.’’ Con-
trol. Everybody wants it; very few
have it.”’

In 1961, ‘“THE HUSTLER,” Robert
Rossen’s film about a wandering pool
player that takes on the legendary
Minnesota Fats, received countless
Oscar nominations and was acclaim-
ed as one of that year’s best. Now 26
years later, Paul Newman returns to
his Oscar nominated role as the
wandering ‘‘Fast Eddie’’ Felson in
Martin Scorsese’s blockbuster ‘“THE
COLOR OF MONEY.” It is well cast,
well made, and sizzles with Control.

Newman puts in one of the finest
performances of his career as the
now older and retired ‘‘Fast Eddie.”
The film opens in the bar/pool hall
that he has retired to since leaving
the professional pool circuit. It is
here that he first encounters Vincent
Lauria (Tom Cruise), a wet-nosed,
thick-skulled kid who can shoot the
eyes out of a pool table. Felson seems
himself in Vincent. In him, he sees
what he used to be and what he sup-
posedly can no longer do. Being the
Hustler that he is, Felson persuades
Vincent and his girlfriend Carmen
(Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio) to go
with him on the road. There, Vincent
can learn the ropes, learn the big-
time, learn how to hustle. The
Ultimate Goal—The 9-Ball Cham-
pionships in Atlantic City.

Learning the ropes turns out to be
much harder than anticipated,
though, and Felson and Lauria split,
leaving the film’s climaxing end in
the balance.

This is a great pool movie, but it’s
about much more than just pool.
“THE COLOR OF MONEY” is about
life; it’s about paying the price.
“Pool Excellence is not about Ex-

cellent Pool. It’s about becoming
something, a_ student...of human
moves.’’ Newman's line is exem-
plary of the film’s message.
Everything has a price and everyone
can learn something new. ‘‘The best
is the one with the most”’ but to be the
best, you have to pay the price.

The cinematography in the prac-
tice rooms and pool halls en route to
Atlantic City, as well as the scenes in
the tournament are fantastic and will
probably win the cinematographer
an Oscar nomination, This movie will
do for your pool playing what
“ROCKY” did for your fitness. If you

Film Society draws sizeable crowd

By MICHAEL TUGGLE
Staff Reporter

 

If someone were to describe to you
a group of 250 people at one single
event, what would you think of? A
Fraternity party? A mandatory lec-
ture? A swim meet between two of
the girls schools perhaps? How about
at a showing by the Washington and
Lee Film society? Well believe it!
Last weekend, the film society was
faced with a very pleasant surprise;
200 to 250 people at both showings of
“Erendira’, the award-winning
Spanish film they were showing. ,Ac-
cording to President Rob Merritt, the

film society has been getting about
250 a weekend for its showings, but
last weekend there were that many
for each performance.

The film society tries to show one
film per month, or about nine to tena
year. ‘The films we try to get are
award winners or acclaimed films
that the audience may not get to see
otherwise in Lexington. We try to
provide a program that is culturally
valuable through the film art’ com-
mented Merritt. A meeting of the
film society is scheduled for a few
weeks from now and will be posted.
Merritt welcomed anyone to come
and urges those wanting to see a
particular film to come to the

W&L

meeting and contribute their sugges-
tion.

The film society has two films
scheduled at the present time to be
shown later in the term. The first is a
French film called ‘The Return of
Martin Guerre.”’ The second is a film
that recently appeared on Home Box
Office called ‘Choose Me.’’ They, as
are all film society presentations, are
open to the public free of charge.
However, contributions can be made
by those desiring to support the film
society. Merritt noted that with these
contributions the film society wants
to arrange for a film related speaker
to appear at W&L some time next
year.
