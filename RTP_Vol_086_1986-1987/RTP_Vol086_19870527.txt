Trustees make faculty promotions

 

From Staff Reports

 

The Washington and Lee board of
trustees approved several faculty
promotions during its May meeting
last week at the campus.

Five faculty members were pro-
moted from associate professor to
professor. They are: Philip L. Cline,
Craig W. McCaughrin, J.Holt Mer-
chant, Ronald L. Reese and Gordon
P. Spice.

Two faculty members — Wayne M.
Dymacek and Edward O. Henneman
— were promoted from assistant pro-
fessor to associated professor.

Kathy J. Koberstein was promoted
from instructor to assistant pro-
fessor.

A 1967 graduate of W&L in

 

economics, Cline received his M.S.
and Ph.D. degrees from Oklahoma
State University. He served as
research asssociate at the depart-
ment of agricultural economics at
OSU from 1974 to 1975, when he joined
the faculty at W&L. Cline’s areas of
expertise are the principles of
microeconomics and
macroeconomics, elementary ap-
plied statistics, quantitiative models
for adminsitration and economics,
and mathematical economics.

McCaughrin joined the W&L facul-
ty in 1981. He received his B.A.
degree from Wayne State University,
and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from
the University of Minnesota. Mc-
Caughrin served as an instructor and
assistant professor of political
science at the University of Penn-
sylvania from 1973 to 1981. His

Law school graduation emphasizes lifelong

 

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Assignments Editor

 

Just when they thought it was safe
to put away their pens and paper,
Washington and Lee University’s law
school graduates were told Sunday
that their examination period had not
yet ended.

Standing on the temporary stage
that had been erected on W&L’s
grassy front lawn, President John D.
Wilson reminded the 114 graduates
and their guests about the upcoming
bar exams. So did Sol Wachtler, chief
judge of the New York Court of Ap-
peals and one of W&L’s most
distinguished alumni.

But Wachtler, who received both
his undergraduate and law degrees
from W&L, as well as an honorary

doctorate in 1981, also told the new
alumni that they would be examined
for the rest of their lives no matter
how hard they tried to escape being
tested.

Workers are scrutinized by their
employers and_ supervisors,
Wachter said. Sole practitioners will
find that the defeated client is one of
the toughest examiners. Judges will
have their rulings overturned by
higher court judges. And even chief
judges of courts-of-last-resort will
find their work cut up and attacked
by dissenters, commentators, jour-
nalists and law-review writers.

Dressed in their traditional black
caps and gowns, some holding
wooden staffs — another W&L tradi-
tion — the graduates listened quietly
on the hot, humid afternoon, as a
rain-threatening breeze occasionally

teaching areas include comparative,
developmental, international, and
Soviet politics, political behavior,
and political analysis.

Merchant received his B.A. degree
from W&L in 1961 and his Ph.D. from
the University of Virinia. He joined
the W&L faculty in 1970. His areas of
interest include American and Afro-
American history, the history of the
federal constitution and the history of
the Civil War and reconstruction.

Reese received his B.A. from Mid-
dlebury College and his Ph.D. from
Johns Hopkins University. He served
as assistant professor of physics at
Bates College and visiting assistant
professor of physics at Worcester
Polytechnic Institute and Pacific
University before joining the W&L
faculty in 1979. Reese’s areas of in-
terest include astronomy, electronics

and general physics.

Spice received his B.A.B. degree
from Toledo University, his B.A. and
M.A. degrees from Ohio State
University and his Ph.D. from the
University of North Carolina. He
joined the faculty at W&L in 1975.
Spice’s teaching areas include
classical and baroque music, the
literature and style of vocal music,
fundamentals of voice production
and introduction to music.

Dymacek received his B.S. and
Ph.D. degrees from irginia
Polytechnic and State University. He
served as a_ cryptanalytic
mathematician for the National
Security Agency from 1978 to 1981,
when he joined the faculty at W&L.
Dymacek’s areas of teaching interest
are real analysis, calculus, discrete
mathematics nad graphtheory.

Henneman received his B.A. from

Yale University and his J.D. from the
Harvard Law School. He served as
an associate with theNew York firms
of Kelley, Drye, Newhall, Maginnes
& Warren adn Winthrop, Stimson,
Putnam & Roberts before being nam-
ed associated director of develop-
ment at W&L in 1972. He remained in
that position until 1978, when he was
named to the W&L faculty. Hen-
neman’s teaching areas include
family law, family wealth transac-
tions and estate planning.

Koberstein received her B.A. from
Carroll College, M.A. from Mid-
dlebury College and Ph.D. from the
University of Wisconsin. She served
as instructor in French at Valparaiso
University and Wofford College
before joining the W&L faculty in
1984. her areas of interest include
French and Spanish, and contem-
porary French literature.

Frat renovation study planned

 

From Staff Reports

 

The Washington and Lee board of
trustees has authorized the universi-
ty to begin the first phase of a major
fraternity house renovation effort.

At its spring meeting held in Lex-
ington on Saturday, the trustees ap-
proved a proposal from their campus
life committee that the university
employ an architectural firm for a
feasibility study of the renovation
project.

In addition, the board has

.. eStablished.an ad hoc committee to

examine possible financing options to
perform the recommended renova-
tions.

The feasibility study will involve
on-site inspections of the university’s
17 fraternity houses in an attempt to
identify needed improvements.

Those inspections, which will begin
this summer, will include such areas
as the heating, electrical and fire
safety systems. The condition of each
of the fraternity houses in relation to
all the other houses will be evaluted.

Among the recommendations that

They all could take consolation in
that they had at least passed this first
test, especially Richard E. Whalen,
of East Hampton, N.Y., who was
awarded the John W. Davis Prize for
the highest cumulative grade point
average.

And although Wachtler — who
started the moot court program at
W&L — talked of tests, he was very
positive about their value. Rather
than speak of examiner as execu-
tioner, Wachtler instead said that the
examiner remains a close companion
who spurs one on to higher
achievements.

Even the U.S. Constitution, which
was written in 90 days and now has
lasted 200 years, is being examined,
the judge said.

feasibility study are for im-
provements in space utilization,
modernized kitchen/during facilities
and renovation living spaces. The
study will include a preliminary cost
estimate for all the recommended
improvements.

“This is a necessary first step in
order to get a better handle on what
we are actually talking about in
terms of renovating the various
houses,” said J. Thomas Touchton,
chairman of the trustees’ campus life
committee. ‘‘We antieipate*ther will
be considerable variance between
the renovations required by some
houses as opposed to others.”’

Once the feasibility study is com-
pleted, the trustees’ ad hoc commit-
tee will be in a better position to con-
sider possible methods of financing
the renovations and repairs. That
committee will work closely with
representatives of the fraternities’
house corporations, which are com-
posed primarily of alumni who are,
in effect, the landlords who rent the

“Those who came before us did
their work well,” Wachtler said.
Because lawyers have been responsi-
ble for much of our present state of
affairs, they must expect to bear at
least an equal responsibility for the
nation’s future.

“That responsibility, I believe,
does not include an acceptance of the
belief that the past has done its work
for the present, and that pure liberty,
which is the cornerstone of
democracy, is forever guaranteed,”’
he said. All of the country’s greatest
documents ‘‘are only words, depen-
dent on each generation te give them
a meaning and significance for our
time.”

Wachtler said he did not know how
the founding fathers would have
viewed such problems as Hudson
River pollution or telephone

student members.

“T think it is important that the
university’s students realize that his
board of trustees is interested in hav-
ing our fraternities play as positive a
role in the total university and Lex-
ington communities as_ possible,”
Touchton said. ‘Authorizing this
feasibility study is one indication of
that interest and this board’s com-
mitment to an overall renaissance of
the Washington and Lee fraternity
system.”

The renaissance movement has
begun on several different fronts. A
committee of the university’s alumni
association has been at work
throughout the year and sponsored a
symposium on the campus last fall
when students, administrators and
alumni discussed several important
topics concerning fraternity life.

Approximately 75 percent oj
W&L’s male undergraduate students
are members of fraternities. More
than 225 upperclassmen live in the
fraternity houses each year.

eavesdropping. But he also said that
he did not think the writers of the
Constitution wanted the current
generation of lawyers to interpret
that document without considering
contemporary morality.

He said that the United States had
survived precisely because lawyers
and judges had recognized their
obligation to adapt the law to what
Thomas Jefferson called ‘‘the crises
of human affairs.”

“Time moves quickly,’ Wachtler
concluded, ‘‘and while the present
may seem eternal, all too soon future
generations will be here to appraise
our work as we now appraise the
work of our forebears. When they do,
they will hopefully conclude: This
was our nation, still in its youth, and
that we too passed the test, that we
too did our work well.”’

Lexington blue law issue to be decided in Tuesday vote

 

By MARIE DUNNE
Editorial Page Editor

 

Lexington and Rockbridge voters
will decide if area stores should be
allowed to open on Sundays in a
special vote on Tuesday

Area stores such as Roses and
Maxway began closing on Sundays
starting Jan. 1, after local police
started enforcing the blue law.

The blue law is a Virginia code that
requires stores selling primarily non-
essential items to close on Sundays.
The code contains a provision that
allows localities to repeal its effect in
their area.

According toa story in Lexington’s
News-Gazette last fall, the blue law
was never formally repealed for this
area, even though many stores open-
ed on Sundays anyway. One com-
plaint was all it would take to make
this the police enforce the laws, said
the article.

Acity merchant subsequently com-
plained and the police began to en
force the law at the beginning of 1987

ee ete rere

Several merchants from Lexington
and Rockbridge then formed an in-
formal committee to see about get-
ting the law repealed. According to
Brian Shaw, a member of the com-
mittee, a petition signed by 10 per-
cent of registered voters was needed
to schedule a special vote on the law.
There must also be 60 days’ public
notice before any vote.

June 2 was selected for the vote
because ‘‘that was about the earliest
we could do it,”’ said Shaw.

The News-Gazette has received
many letters to the editor on the Sun-
day closings. Local residents and
businesses seem divided on the issue.

One group favoring the enforce-

ment of blue laws calls _ itself
“Citizens Against Sunday Open-
ings.’’ Gene Williams, manager of
the Lexington Leggett store and
chairman of “Citizens Against Sun
day Openings,’’ was out of town this
week and could not be reached for
comment. The group’s treasurer,
Bryan McFadden, who also works for
Leggett, said, ‘I really have no com
ment to make.’

The committee of merchants in
favor of Sunday openings has launch-
ed a publicity campaign, complete
with bumperstickers and buttons,
calling for the repeal of the blue laws.
The group will have full-page ads in
area papers and run radio ads on
Lexington’s two area_ stations,
WREL and WVLI, according to
Shaw. Roses produced and paid for
large blue-and-white posters that are
hanging in business’ windows.

“We don’t perceive the blue laws
as a religious issue, but an issue of
freedom, freedom to shop on Sun-
days,”’ said Shaw.

Frances Ruley, an employee of
Maxway and member of the commit-
tee, agrees. If a merchant wants to
open on Sundays ‘‘that merchant
should have the freedom of choice,”
said Ruley.

Even local businesses that do not
have to close on Sunday are concern-
ed the law will cause them to lose
revenue.

“What it affects is really what we
can offer in the area as far as our
guests are concerned. We have

weekend guests that come to see the
historical sites in the area, and it’s a
major inconvenience for them not to
be able to shop on Sundays,”’ said
Sandra Hatter, general manager of
Days Inn.

Many of those who support the blue
laws say the county is losing money
by holding a special vote. The elec-
tion will cost less than $10,000 total,
$1,500 for the city and about $7,000 for
the county. Although no estimates
are available, many people feel the
cost of the election is ‘‘just a drop in
the bucket’’ compared to the revenue
already lost from Sunday closings,
according to Maxway manager
Barry Guffy.

“In sales per hour, Sunday (was)
our best day,’’ said Guffy.

A major argument for Sunday clos
ings is that they allow employees to
spend time with their families.

“Tf any employee needs to get off to
their mother or grandmother or
relative, all they have to do is ask,”’
said Guffy, who cited that 90 percent
of Maxway employees are willing to
work on Sundays.

Pat Richardson, senior assistant
merchandizing manager for Roses,
said, “I think basically (the
employees) are supportive of
(repealing the blue law) because it
means extra money for them. They
get paid time and a half on Sundays.
There are always going to be two or
three (who don’t want to work), but
we're not forcing anybody to work on
Sundays. It’s all on a volunteer basis.
We've always had enough people
volunteer without having to draft
anybody.”’

As for the vote this Tuesday, Shaw
said the group of merchants favoring
Sunday openings is ‘cautiously op-
timistic” that the voters will repeal
the blue law. The group is concerned,
however, that voters don’t assume
that support is so strong that the law
will be repealed without their vote

Hatter of Days Inn favors the
repeal of the blue law but says she is
not sure how the vote will turn out.
“because my feeling is that the peo-
ple who are against it are more likely
to go out and vote, rather than the
people who are for it.”’

One more milk
for the road

By Steven Pockrass

So there we were, once again sitting in the old milk bar, downing a
few smoothies during The Final Days.

Then it happened. The question every senior is sick and tired of
hearing: ‘‘So do you know what you’re going to do next year?”

We all hate having to answer that query, yet like some sort of
sadistic cult, we ask each other anyway. Yes, yes, yes dammit! I’ve
got a reporting job. Well, at least through the end of August, but it
might become full-time. And if not? Well, I’m sure I’ll be doing
something. At least drinking milk and chasing chicks on the beach, if

nothing else.

But seriously, folks, what if you really DON’T KNOW what you're
going to be doing next year? Sure, that W&L degree probably qualifies
you to fish out burgers at the local greasy-spoon laundromat. But what
if you want something better?

Well, have I got a deal for you, a bargain you can’t refuse. Now it’s a
well-known fact that we J-types devote our lives to writing, while you
pre-meds, pre-laws, and C-Schoolers devote your lives to mak-
ing money. So let me write about just a few entrepreneurial ideas that
have been floating around in my head and let you take all the credit.

My own favorite is a senior button kit that would answer the dreaded
question. Selections might include: ‘Yes, I’m A Senior; No, I don’t
Have A Job,” Unemployed But Looking,” “Unemployed But Begg-
ing,” “Unemployed But Groveling,” or perhaps simply “DON’T
ASK!”’

For you cuisinary chemists, why not invent a machine that would
put all the sugar and caffeine back into diet sodas when all the real
soda runs out? Or manufacture a fruit juice with 10 percent real soft
drink in it. How about a ‘dorm counselor’s coffee cup” for continental
breakfast, about six inches wide and 12 inches deep?

For you key-punches, let’s see a computer with a ‘‘you-know”’ button
on it. (Source — Ham Smith). That’s the button you push when you
know what you want to do and you want the computer to know it too.

If you’re a back-to-nature type who lives in New York City, why not
develop a ‘‘Make-your-own condom”’ kit? Or how about a home AIDS
test? I can see the ads already. ‘‘Now, in the privacy and comfort of
your own home, you too can find out if you’re one of the millions of
unlucky Americans ....”’

And although I’ve never actually worn a pair of women’s shoes, it’s
always been my contention that the most-loved man in the world will
be the one who invents a good-looking, comfortable pair of women’s
shoes. I’ve seen too many women walking to work in tennis shoes and
watched too many women take their shoes off behind their desks to re-
main blind to the fact that the female shoe market is just waiting to be
conquered.

And what was I doing looking at women’s legs behind their desks,
you may ask. Well, I’d like to tell you but I’m afraid we’ve run out of

I have one paper left to write; I’ve
read the last book, my thesis is hand-
ed in, and I’ve completed my P.E. re-
quirement. All that’s standing bet-
ween me and a diploma is this 15-
page paper, which, I suppose, | will
somehow find the motivation to
finish. After four years we are truly
on the home stretch. I even watched
the law students graduate today just
to get prepped for mine.

Naturally enough, as I get ready to
step across that chasm of the
bachelor’s degree into my futnre of
Reality (and unemployment) I’ve
been doing a lot of thinking about
what this place means to me. This
then is what you’ve dreaded all year
—that ‘‘A Senior Looks Back’’ end-of-
the-year essay with the lamentations
of not having done all that he set out
to do and original comments like
“*You get out of this place what you
put into it!” Well, I'll try not to be
quite that trite.

Four years is a long time, and the
class of 1987 has been through a lot in
those years — everything from
changes in the drinking laws and
coeducation to dealing with all-

‘ 00K ANY YOUNGER...
FouR YEARS AND $40,000 LATER, HE STILL DIDN'T 100 G

talize them — too bad, ’cause here I
go.
For starters there are the room-
mates. I’ve had a new one every year
— you want to talk memories!
Freshman year I lived in the only tri-
ple at W&L with John and Allison. I’d
love to give him a hard time about
how he never had to do laundry for
himself, but then Allison was always
nice to me and would sew buttons
back on my shirts, so I'll just give
‘em best wishes. Then there were
Pete and Woods Creek. We weren't
sure we’d make it through the year
what with the three other crazies
(literally) we lived with, but
sémehow we made it, Pete living on
yogurt (how much money did you
spend on that girl at F.D., Pete?),
and I on fried bologna. Then last year
as I made my one foray into the class
of ’86, there was Bart, the only person
I’ve ever known who could cook
sweet-and-sour pork while discussing
Mozart in Russian and painting a
German countryside in oils. Finally
this year, one of my oldest friends
from freshman year, the self-styled
genetic mutant with no lungs and no

for a year!

Then there’s the gang in the Glee
Club and University Chorus. Five
foreign countries and four years
later, I still have more fun with this
group than just about anyone. An-
drew, Christie, Kristen, Jim, Davids,
and Tom — keep up the good work,
have a blast in England, and drink a
few pints of bitter for me. My life has
revolved around those rehearsals,
concerts in the Chapel and tours, and
I’m really going to miss them and
you.

I think one of the things which is
most unique about W&L is that some
of the best friends we make are with
the faculty. I have enjoyed getting to
know nearly all my professors, and
wish I could have gotten to know
many of them better. But two pro-
fessors stand out in my mind as peo-
ple who have really been important
to me. Professor Craun of the
English Department has given me
more than my fair share of good ad-
vice over the years and I only hope
that when I have students of my own

nighters and the Cold Checkplace, time for anything non-logical except some day I will take the time and-
but not all of us are fortunate enough a pizza, Mark. Hats off to all of you concern over them that he has over
to have a column in which to immor- _ for lots of fun and putting up with me

Club and Chorus has probably been
the biggest constant in my W&L
career; ‘‘Doc’’ manages always to
combine work and _ pleasure,
resulting in witty lectures and fun yet
productive rehearsals. I can’t im-
agine not being able to walk into his
office at 9:00 to ask just one question
and leave at 10:30 — only to realize
that I forgot to ask him my question.
And more often than not there was no
question to begin with. These two are
what W&L is all about, and I’m glad
to have known them, and more im-
portantly, to have had them as
friends.

From the (illegal) Halloween Hall
Crawl freshman year to the road trip
up to Ohio Wesleyan two weeks ago,
these past few years have been a lot
of memories. But what makes these
memories is people. W&L has some
great people — students and faculty
— and I think they, more than
anything else, make this place
special. To my classmates I say good
luck guys, it’s been a great four
years. And to those who still have
some time left in Lexington, I hope
you leave here with the memories
and the friends that the class of '87
has. And now I suppose I better get

space in this week’s Phi, and besides, it’s time for another milk,
perhaps with a little Strawberry Quik in it. Now there was an inven-
tion.

I know we're out of space, but one quick thought: As you make but-
tloads of bucks off these great ideas, remember me, okay? Checks will
be accepted. Have a good life.

 

 

 

Positive

One criticism that is often leveled at the Ring-tum Phi is
that the paper dwells too often on the negative. Why don’t you
ever write about all the good things that happen at
Washington and Lee, people ask.

Well, Wednesday evening was our chance to celebrate
what’s good about our university. The Ring-tum Phi
presented its annual awards to five individuals who have
made outstanding contributions to the Washington and Lee
community.

Carol Ann Calkins, Jeffery G. Hanna, David W. Sprunt,
Brandt Surgner and Rob Vienneau have all gone above and
beyond the call of duty in their service to their university.
They should serve as an example to all of us.

Of course, there are countless other students, faculty and
administrators who have contributed much to W&L
(including Jefferson Davis Futch and Shayam Menon, who
received the Pusey and Gilliam Awards, respectively, from
‘he Executive Committee Wednesday night).

And there are many others, far too numerous to name in
his limited space. What about the Calyx staff members, who
spend long sleepless nights trying to meet an impossible
leadline? What about the students who drag themselves out
of bed at 6 a.m. to host ‘‘Morning Magazine” on WLUR?

Or how about the members of Contact, who work out the
ndless details necessary to bring nationally known speakers
o the campus? Or the SAB and the Student Telephone Union,
he Mock Convention and the Glee Club? The list goes on and
m

These are the people who make Washington and Lee
pecial. And although we can’t present them all with engrav-
d awards, every, once in a while we ought to sit back and
ive them our thanks.

The editorial cartoon printed in last week’s

poor taste. The residents of Fishbait have not

They deserve more than to be publicly
humiliated and convicted by the campus
newspaper. What useful comment were you

Your cartoon showed not only a serious breach of
trust, but a lamentable lack of style. Is that your
version of satire? Other students have been

openly condemning a group of our fellow

Thanks to everyone

To the Washington and Lee University
Community:

I just wanted to write a quick note and say how
much I have enjoyed interning at W&L this
semester. Everyone with whom I have worked
has been extremely friendly and helpful.

From the fraternities to the residence staff to
the deans and staff, I have been impressed with
everyone’s concern for excellence, both
academically and personally. My realm of pro-
fessional experience has increased immensely
since my stay here.

Thank you again for a great semester and my
hope is that Washington and Lee continues to
reign as one of the premier academic institutions
of the South.

Cartoon is ‘irresponsible’
‘Lu ihe Editors:

Last week’s editorial page cartoon fails far
short of any semblance of humor. The irresponsi-
ble journalistic practices of the cartoonist;
editorial page editor, Marie Dunne; and of the
Ring-tum Phi’s editorial staff as a whole have
once again been clearly illustrated by the prin-
ting of this ‘“‘humorous”’ cartoon. In my opinion,
this was not only an unethical but also a
dishonorable act, although I am defining
“honor’’ here a bit more broadly than simply as
abstinence from lying, cheating, and stealing.

As for myself, the printing of this insulting car-
toon served to destroy the last shred of respect
which I held for your feeble attempts at jour-
nalism which you continue to try to pass as an
ethical, responsible and unbiased school
newspaper.

The unnecessarily malicious nature of the
caricature is further illustrated by the idiotic let-
tering of the ‘‘sign” and the ridiculous depiction
of “a young W&L student.’ (Messrs. Lutz and

 

Kubly are both seniors and Mr. Thompson is a

junior, hardly ‘‘young” W&L students. )

Why did you choose to assault these
gentlemen? There have been much more serious
drug arrests made against which there was no
similar edict issued from the apparently morally
superior editorial department of the Ring-tum
Phi. Are there other reasons for this unnecessary
attack of which we are ignorant?

Finally, it is my belief that a formal apology
should be issued not only to Messrs. Lutz, Kubly
and Thompson, but also to the entire Washington
and Lee community whose intelligence has once
again been insulted by the kind of irresponsible
journalism which has characterized the Ring-
tum Phi all year long.

If you are aspiring to be responsible, credible
journalists, then you are on the wrong track.

Smith on Jackson

To the Editors:

In response to ‘Reader Disagrees with
Jackson’s Platform,’ I disagree with Mr.
Maass’s assertion that Presidential hopeful
Jesse Jackson displayed ‘‘sadly misguided
(liberal) politics,” vis-a-vis the American role in
Central America. Of all the Presidential can-
didates thus far, I believe that Jackson has main-
tained the most reasonable position, urging a
cessation of military operations, and a return to
negotiations buttressed with a commitment for
economic aid.

Notwithstanding the fact that American policy
in Central America is riddled with inconsistency,
arms scandals, and an incompetent President
who tries to moralize the Contra-cause by com-
paring them, most shamefully, to our Founding
Fathers; reality dictates that America not get in-
volved, at least not militarily. To take the com-
parison that Mr. Maass develops when he writes,
“T would hate to see what America would be like
today if the French had adopted the same policy
(non-involvement) toward our fledgling nation in
1779,” I would pose this question to Mr. Maass
—Did the French send in official troops to win
the war for us? Yet this is what the U.S. has
begun to do with a troop infiltration of Honduras
in the number of 1,400 troops. These American
troops have begun a commitment to Honduras,
and to the Contras, at a time when the U.S. has
no defined strategic goals in the area. And if they
have been defined (i.e. in the Pentagon ex-
clusively) then they have yet to be presented to
the American people to be embraced or rejected.

Why is involvement of the American people so
important? Consider this quote by Colonel Harry
Summers in his book ‘“‘On Strategy: The Viet-
nam War in Context,” printed by the Army War
College: ‘The failure to invoke the national will
was one of the major strategic failures of the
Vietnam War. It produced a strategic vulnera-
bility that our enemy was able to exploit.’’
Besides those various wealthy individuals who
have illegally contributed to the contra-scam
fund, there has been no indication of national will
in terms of America’s role in Central America.

Nevertheless, the administration has commit-
ted itself and the country to the Contra-cause

plagued by lack of direction, lack of any better
alternative government, lack of international
support, and finally and most importantly —lack
of any moral imperative. Basically, we have
committed ourselves in a very undemocratic
way, toa group of terrorists, coming from an old
tradition of terrorists and high-handed despots.
Their aim is to topple the present authoritarian
left-wing regime, and establish their own
authoritaria right-wing regime (even conser-
vatives agree on this one). The net benefits,
however, do not outweigh the costs involved, the
many young American lives that will be shed for
no real benefit. Yes, Mr. Maass, I do agree with
Mr. Jackson when we say something has gone
awry; in this case, the way in which America in-
volves herself abroad militarily. One drop of
American blood shed in that region, is one drop
too many.

Caruthers thanks Menon
To the Editors:

As a W&L student I wanted to write and thank
Shayam Menon for serving as President of the
Student Body this year. The job is an extremely
demanding and time-consuming one, and it can
detract greatly from a senior’s final year at
W&L. Nevertheless, Shayam has exemplified the
ultimate in commitment and dedication to the
University. In fact, his zealousness during his
three years on the Executive Committee, as well
as simply all four years here at W&L, has been
contagious.

Over the past year, he has dutifully expressed
student opinion to the faculty, administration,
and Board of Trustees in an impressive and ef-
fective manner, while at the same time eliciting
nothing but respect from all parties — something
which is rare. I take this time to toot his horn for
fear his service to the W&L Student Body will go
unappreciated. He has commanded the entire
E.C.’s respect and admiration. I want to thank
him for a job — and a W&L career — well done.

Sincerely,

Diversity, Variety needed for school activities

NEWS ANALYSIS

 

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Assignments Editor

 

Does Washington and Lee provide
a wide enough variety of student ac-
tivities? Not according to some of the
people who are responsible for stu-
dent activities at W&L.

Student activities take many forms
here: fraternity functions, film socie-
ty films, athletic club contests and
others. Although the fraternities are
funded by student dues, almost all
the other organizations receive stu-
dent tax money allocated by the stu-
dent Executive Committee. Each
student pays $100 a year in student
taxes, $25 of which goes to pay for the
Student Activities Pavilion.

Far and away, the organization
that receives the greatest portion of
the tax money is the Student Ac-
tivities Board, which this year
received $46,000 out of a total of
$133,650.

The purpose of this article is to
reflect the thoughts of some of those
people who help make decisions
about the diversity of activities here
at W&L.

The board of trustees is the
ultimate custodian of all aspects of

the new drinking laws — for groups
that want alcohol.

John said he goes to many
meetings, especially to discuss pro-
gramming under the new drinking
laws. ‘‘We obviously need to come up
with more imaginative and creative
programming without alcohol as the
focus.”

Many student activities come
under the umbrella of Leroy C. ‘‘Bud-

Atkins is responsible for the

Atkins said he thinks the SAB
replicates much of what the frater-

said he thinks the SAB needs to pro-
vide some activities for students who
don’t enjoy fraternity parties. “I
think there’s a great need for diversi-

THE SAB

Glynn M. Alexander Jr., head of
the SAB, said he too would like to see :
more diversity inthe programming. -

But that’s easier said than done.
Although he was executive director
of the SAB last year, he said it took
him until January just to feel comfor-
table with what he was doing. He said
it’s very easy to get in a rut and
decide to stick with the standard
forms of entertainment.

Alexander said it is hard to get a
wide variety of music at a small, out-
of-the-way school because “working
with one date is really hell.’”’ Other
colleges have bands on weekdays.
They put on shows for the whole
school, but they don’t expect the
whole school to attend.

The SAB used to show movies, but
“the interest for that just plum-
meted,’’ Alexander said. It’s become
much more feasible for a student to
go to a video store and watch movies
at home ona VCR.

Like Atkins, Alexander said he
thought the SAB should try to have
more activities that are relatively in-
expensive and would provide enter-
tainment for smaller groups. The
SAB shouldn’t be afraid of failing,
and the students shouldn’t be afraid
to try something new.

‘You at least try something once,”’
he said.

Seniors key

track team’s
winning years

 

 

By JIM LAKE
Staff Reporter

 

For five W&L seniors, four years of
track competition at Washington and
Lee have brought nothing but suc-
cess.

Since coming to W&L in the fall of
1983, Ash Andrews, John Burl-
ingame, Tom Murray, John Carder
and Matthew Steilberg have spent
most of their afternoons from
January through April trying to run a
little faster, throw a little farther,
and jump a little higher.

And, for each of them, the hard
work has paid off.

“This group of seniors we have has
just had phenomenal success since
they’ve been here,” said head track
coach Norris Aldridge. ‘‘They have
not lost a dual-, tri-, or quad-meet [in
four indoor and four outdoor seasons
and ] have won six of the eight titles
that it was possible for them to win.”’

Since 1984, W&L track teams have
not lost a single regular-season meet,
compiling a 27-0 record, and have
placed no lower than second in eight
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
Championship meets, winning all but
two of those contests.

A four-year letter-winner in cross
country, Andrews is an economics
major from Floyds Knobs, Ind. “He
did an excellent job’ competing in
distance events in a conference that
“has always had outstanding
distance runners,’’ said Aldridge.

Burlingame, an economics major
from Metairie, La. was the ODAC in-
door long jump champion in 1986 and
1987 and missed first place by haif an

inch in 1985. Burlingame also ran the
400 meters and was on W&L’s con-
ference champion 400-meter relay
team in the 1987 indoor season. Un-
fortunately, a recurring hamstring
injury kept Burlingame from com-
peting for conference championships
outdoors in 1985, 1986 and 1987.

The ODAC and school record-
holder in the shot put, Murray was
the conference champion in that
event indoors in 1986 and 1987 and
outdoors in 1985 and 1987. He was
presented the Captains’ and Coaches’
Trophy for dedication and loyalty at
last week’s All-Sports Barbecue.
Murray, also an economics major, is
from Princeton, N.J.

Steilberg won the ODAC pole vault
title indoors in 1985 and outdoors in
1986. An English major from Rich-
mond, he also performed well this
year, clearing 13 feet and taking
third place at the ODAC indoor meet
and second at the outdoor meet.

In 1987, Carder took over as the
Generals’ leading vaulter. The
chemistry major from Roanoke
finished second in the indoor pole
vault and was the conference cham-
pion in that event for the outdoor
season.

Although they did not run as
freshmen, Aldridge commended
three-year letter-winners Kevin
Weaver, who ran on five ODAC
championship relay teams, and
Steve Pockrass, who ran cross coun-
try for four years and was a
wrestler during his freshman year.

“The seniors are really to be con-
gratulated for their effort,’ said

Aldridge. ‘‘We’ll really miss then Boyd, Tom Murray, Ash Andrews, Steve Pockrass, John Burl-

next year.”’

When Jefferson Harralson ar-

he was six feet, four inches tall
and barely earned a varsity letter
for playing basketball. By the
time he finished his senior season,
he had grown to his present height
of 6’ 6” and had scored 1,219
career points, placing him 11th on
the all-time career scoring list. It
is for his incredible final season
that Jefferson Harralson has been
chosen as the Phi’s Athlete-of-the-
Year.

Check out the numbers. Har-
ralson scored 524 points (a 21.0 per
game), grabbed 198 rebounds
(7.8) and dashed off 48 assists
(1.9). He led the team in scoring in
19 of the Generals’ 25 games and
in rebounding in 17 contests. He
connected on 172 out of 330 field-
goal attempts (52.1 percent) and
nailed 147 out of 198 free throws

But it was on Jan. 27, 1987, when
Harralson entered the W&L
record books. With exactly 10:52
remaining in the first half of an
away game versus Hampden-
Sydney, Harralson buried a 10-
foot jumper for his 999th and
1,000th career points.

“TI kind of expected it,” said
Harralson of reaching the
milestone. “If I didn’t get it, I
would have been disappointed. I
guess when I look back it will be
more of an accomplishment.”

What can be viewed as a major
accomplishment is the way Har-
ralson’s game has progressed
through his four years on the court
here at W&L. Harralson, who
began playing basketball in
Princeton, Ky. when he was eight
years old, was a member of the
Generals’ squad during his
freshman year. But ‘‘member’”’ is
about all you could call him.

“T had no idea what to expect in
Division III,” he said, “‘There are
no Division III schools in the area
I’m from.

“But I went to the gym to play
and I saw a bunch of slow, white
dudes. I said to myself, ‘I think I
can play with these guys.’”’

Playing behind three other

 

freshmen, however, Harralson
saw precious little playing time
and even considered quitting the
team. He decided to stick it out
one more year and, after the fifth
game of his sophomore season, he
had earned a starting position.
With that hurdle cleared, Har-
ralson turned his attention to scor-
ing more points.

“T didn’t think I had to [score a
lot of points],’’ he said, ‘“‘but coach
{Canfield] felt I should step to the
forefront. I always played better
as acomplementary player.

“By my senior season,” he said,
“T felt like I was the guy that had
toscore.”’

But, although he attained his
achievements by himself on an in-
dividual basis, Harralson didn’t
hesitate to cite as his most
memorable basketball experience
a team accomplishment.

“My junior year in the ODAC
tourney quarterfinals, we were
behind 13 points at halftime. Then
they scored four straight points to
take a 17-point lead, two of them
coming on a slam dunk. But we
ended up beating them by eight
points.

“That comeback was the finest
team effort I ever saw. It was
definitely the game I will
remember the most.”’

Coach Norris Aldridge, whose
track teams won two conference
titles and went undefeated in 1987,
is The Phi’s Coach-of-the-Year.

Aldridge came to Washington
and Lee in 1969 as an assistant in
football and track and field. He
took over the leadership of the
track program in 1971. Since then,
W&L track teams have compiled
a record of 94-42. And, since 1976,
his squads have never suffered
more than three losses in a single
season, compiling a record of
63-15, or an 80.8 winning percen-
tage. W&L is riding a streak of
four consecutive Old Dominion
Athletic Conference titles in in-
door track, and an Aldridge-
coached team has not lost a track
meet since 1983.

A native of Natural Bridge,
Aldridge was a standout quarter-
back at Natural Bridge High

School for three seasons. He went
on to earn three varsity football
letters and a degree in business
administration from the Universi-
ty of Richmond.

The year 1987 saw W&L track
teams blow away the ODAC, tak-
ing the indoor championship by 48
points and the outdoor title by 55
points. But, typically, Aldridge

 

gives all the credit to his athletes.

‘“‘We really had some outstan-
ding performances,” he said.
W&L “‘lost a lot of good people
from last year,’’ and two con-
ference championships really
were not expected, but this team
“twas able to come together’’ ex-
ceptionally well.

The indoor season began with
a record-setting performance by
freshman Phil Sampson in the
VMI Relays. In his first meet as a
collegian, the rookie pole vaulter
cleared 14’6’’, a full six inches bet-
ter than the school record.

In the ODAC Indoor Champion-
ship meet, held at VMI, W&L
crushed the conference, taking
first place in five events and
finishing in at least one of the top
four places in every event but one.
Junior Andrew White won the 55-
meter hurdles, ran on two relay
teams, and took second place in
the 400-meter run. He was named
ODAC Runner-of-the-Year, and
Aldridge was named conference
Coach-of-the-Year in indoor track.
Murray set new school and con-
ference records in winning the
shot put, and senior John Burl-
ingame took first place in the long
jump. Junior John White scored in
four individual events and ran on
two winning relay teams.

The outdoor season began with

a trouncing of Roanoke College in
which W&L won 11 of 17 events
and swept four of them. Junior
John White and Andrew White
won two events, and freshman
Wes Boyd won the 100-meter dash
in his first college track meet.

The Generals prepared for the
ODAC Outdoor Championships by
participating in the Catholic In-
vitational.

The outdoor conference meet
once again demonstrated W&L’s
affinity for large margins of vic-
tory. The Generals embarrassed
the ODAC, taking one of the top
four places in every event but one

and winning nine of the day’s 17 . [

events. Once again, Andrew White
led the Generals, winning the 110
and 400-meter hurdles and runn-
ing on the victorious 1600-meter
relay team. Boyd won the 100 and
200-meter runs and placed third in
the long jump. Murray set a new
outdoor conference record and
again won the shot put, and Moore
took the conference title in the
1500-meter run. Carder won the
pole vault, and McCormick again
won the high jump.

Not surprisingly, Aldridge was
again named ODAC Coach-of-the-
Year. His 6-0 dual-meet record
and two conference titles in 1987
demonstrate outstanding ability
and talent on his part.

Here’s to a job
well done

This is going to be hokey, but what the hell.

The Ring-tum Phi has honored two people this week — Jefferson
Harralson and Norris Aldridge — for their outstanding contribution to
Washington and Lee athletics over the past academic year. In singling
out these two individuals, however, we run into a problem. Every
athlete who participated in intercollegiate athletics for W&L is just as
deserving of receiving such praise.

But what exactly am I trying to get at here? Well, I guess I am say-
ing that, whether or not your picture made it in the Phi as Athlete-of-
the-Week, you all have earned some recognition for the time, effort
and dedication you have given to your respective sports teams.

As the lacrosse amd men’s tennis teams play in the limelight, we
sometimes forget about the people who play the so-called ‘‘minor
sports.’’ Cross country, track, wrestling, golf, women’s tennis and
swimming almost inevitably take a back seat to football, lacrosse,
men’s tennis, basketball and water polo.

I remember David Emrich wrote a column earlier in the year in
which he too expressed his feelings about the dilemma of the unequal
amounts of coverage given one sport over the others. “Second to no
one”’ was the headline and nothing could be closer to the truth.

Why should an athlete who sacrifices just as much time for one sport
not receive his or her due while someone else is grabbing the
spotlight? It sometimes just doesn’t seem fair.

I was talking with a basketball player the other day and this person
(who didn’t even play a whole lot of minutes) was estimating that dur-
ing the season he spent an average of five hours a day (including
weekends) practicing and sitting in meetings.

Five hours a day? Add five more hours and you are holding down a
steady job. And basketball players are not the only ones. I think it’s
safe to say every sport here requires at least three hours a day,
without even considering the amount of time taken up for traveling to
away games.

When you consider these time demands, it becomes even more
amazing to see the list of those athletes who have obtained a 3.5 or
higher GPA for one of the two semesters. I’m positive the number is
just as high for those who make the Dean’s List.

In order to rectify the problem, throughout the fall, winter and spr-
ing sports seasons, David Emrich and I have tried extremely hard to
make sure each team was awarded equal coverage in The Phi. This
task was very difficult, considering the fact that certain sports are
more popular than other ones. Is your lead story the football team’s
great comeback or cross country winning yet another dual meet? I
hope the job we did was good enough and my apologies to those people
who feel their teams were slighted.

I guess the purpose of this final column is to say ‘“‘great job’ to all
the hundreds of athletes who have worn a Generals’ jersey on the play-
ing field or courts. In terms of winners, we had four Old Dominion
Athletic Conference team champions, three Coaches-of-the-Year, two
Players-of-the-Year, six all-Americans and two teams come oh-so-
close to capturing W&L’s first national championship. The athletes
have represented this University well with exemplary sportsmanship
and hard work. To all those who were involved, you have every right to
be proud of yourselves.

(I said it was going to be hokey)

Notes... Turning our attention to the world of the professionals, the
New York Mets are beginning to realize that it ain’t so easy when you
are the defending champions (I think I predicted this somewhere but I
can’t recall exactly where). Dwight Gooden is back, but the loss of
Bobby Ojeda and the inconsistency of Sid Fernandez and Ron Darling
have made the most feared starting rotation seem very tame... Final-
ly, I think a special thanks is in order for Skip Bertram, Perry Hayes
and Mathew Horridge for their efforts in taking sports pictures for The
Phi. Their work was top notch and added a positive dimension for our
sports pages this year
