Staff Reporter

 

Acting Police Chief Lt. Beard ap-
peared at the Inter-Fraternity Coun-
cil meeting Tuesday evening. Beard
became the acting chief after Chief
L.O. Sutton resigned last week citing
philosophical differences.

“T certainly want to continue a
good relationship with you fellas,”
said Beard. He then invited the
members of the IFC to share their
grievances with him.

For about thirty minutes the IFC
representatives laid their complaints
before the acting chief. Several
members complained about the
policy the police have on issuing a
noise violation.

Beard took note of the complaints
from the IFC members and tried to
clarify the operating procedures that
his department would follow.

In dealing with noise violations,
Beard said that before midnight an
officer will issue a verbal warning. If
the officer has to come back, a writ-
ten warning will be issued. After this
the officer will issue a summons for a

noise violation.

If the officer must come after mid-
night, the verbal and written warn-
ings will be given at the same time.
This , if necessary, will be followed
by the summons.

“Technically the cut-off is at mid-
night when the sound permit ex-
pires,”’ Beard said.

Beard also stressed that an officer
can close down a party at any time he
feels the party is out of control.

Beard also addressed the subject of
an officer’s entrance into a fraternity
house, He said he had no problem
with an officer being asked to wait at
the door while a house officer is sum-
moned, provided the party is not too
disruptive. ‘‘I have no problem with
that as long as the person who greets
him cooperates. I certainly want to
meet you half-way. If you go the
other half, everything will be fine,”’
he said.

Before Beard left, he acknowledg-
ed the pressures and problems that
face fraternities and said, ‘“‘You’ve
got to be more responsible. I’m not
saying that you are not responsible.
I’m saying that for your own good
you have to be more responsible.”

NCAA rules Coffland ineligible; W&L plans

 

By STEVE POCKRASS
Assignment Editor

 

Washington and Lee University
running back Chris Coffland was rul-
ed ineligible to play football last
week by the National Collegiate
Athletic Association because he was
not registered for 12 academic
credits this fall

The decision is being appealed

“It’s insane!’ said W&L Athletic
Director William D. McHenry, his
face reddening as he karate-chopped
at his wooded desktop yesterday
afternoon. ‘‘It’s ridiculous!”

McHenry was dumbfounded by last
Thursday’s interpretation of an
NCAA rule after he routinely called
to confirm Coffland’s eligibility. The
cause of the dispute is W&L’s non
traditional academic calendar, in
which the first two terms last 12
weeks, and the third lasts six
Because of the calendar, W&L
students take fewer credit hours per

term than students at many other
schools.

NCAA bylaw 5-1-C requires that a
student-athlete ‘‘be registered for at
least a minimum full-time program
of studies as defined by the institu-
tion.’’ Nine credits are required at
W&L, according to the school
catalog

The bylaw also requires the athlete
te he “fegisterca in 3
minimum of 12 semester or quarter
hours, “or a. similar minimum
academic load as determined by the
NCAA Eligibility Committee in an in-
stitution that determines registration
other than on a traditional semester-
or quarter-hour basis or conducts a
cooperative educational program.”

Coffland, a junior from Baltimore,
is considered a full-time student in
good standing at W&L. But the NCAA
has applied its 12-hour requirement
to his fall term, making him ineligi

Lexington Police Chief Lawrence
O. Sutton resigned last week after
nearly three- and one-half years as
the city’s top police administrator.
City manager Joseph C. King made
the announcement Friday morning.

King declined to comment on the
resignation, but Sutton said that “ir-
resolvable philosophical differ-
ences’’ with King led to his decision
to step down. ‘‘I thought a lot about
this resignation,” Sutton said, “‘but I
was waiting to see where he was
coming from and how we could func-
ion together. This was not a spur of
the moment type thing,’’ Sutton said.

King has been city manager since
August 18. He replaced John V.
Doane, who resigned because his

thought that relations between
fraternities and the police will im-
prove. ‘‘I think you are going to see a
change in the attitude of the police
department. They will probably be
easier to get along with. Easier to
talk with. And easier to work things
out with.”

But Atkins warned the represen-
tatives about letting too many
uninvited guests into the parties and
the problems involved in allowing
guests to drink outside of the house.
Both situations could necessitate the
police having to come to the house
and this is a situation both sides want
to avoid.

In other business, the IF'C announc-
ed that its annual canned food drive
would start next Monday and run
through December 10. Last year, the
IFC raised approximately $4,000 in
canned food, and they hope to sur-
pass that figure this year.

In addition, the IFC voted on its
constitution Tuesday evening. After
several minor alterations, the con-
sitution was accepted by a vote of
15-0 with two abstentions in the first
of two required votes.

emption,” said McHenry, now in his
16th year as athletic director. ‘‘Un-
fortunately, I cannot prove this with
any document.”

McHenry and Sports Information
Director Mark Mandel both question-
ed how the NCAA would apply the
bylaw to the school’s spring term,
when no students are registered for
12 credit hours.

The university is sending a written
appeal to the NCAA Eligibility Com-
mittee, McHenry said. W&L Presi-
dent John D. Wilson will make the ap-
peal personally ‘

‘We plan to appeal it and fight it,”
McHenry said. ‘‘We hope to have it
overturned soon.”

Wilson, a standout defensive back
on Michigan State’s 1952 national
champion football team, was out of
the state yesterday and could not be
reached for comment.

“We have not done anything im-
proper,’’ McHenry said

‘We certainly feel that Chris Cof
fland has not done anything wrong,”

wife accepted a position with a
Washington, D.C., law firm.

Following Sutton’s resignation, Lt.
Bruce M. Beard, 42, was named act-
ing chief of police. Beard also served
as acting chief in 1982 and 1983, when
a police theft ring was being pro-
secuted.

Thirteen Lexington police officers
were indicted in the ring, which stole
merchandise from local stores.
Seven were convicted and left the
police force.

Sutton, 56, a former Virginia Beach
policeman, became chief following
the scandal. In a press release, King
cited Sutton for restoring ‘‘a degree
of professionalism’’ to the depart-
ment.

A nation-wide search will be con-
ducted for a permanent replacement,
King said, although local candidates,

including those currently on the
police force, will be considered.

Finding a new police chief could
take three to four months, be
presented to the Lexington City
Council at its meeting on November
20.

King thinks Beard would make a
qualified candidate for the vacancy.
“It’s premature for him to indicate
interest in the position, but | would
hope he would apply.”’ King said.

In his press release, King also in-
dicated that he would ask the City
Council to approve a severence pay-
ment equalivalent to three month’s
salary for Sutton.

Sutton plans to take some time off
for hunting season before he makes
any decisions about his future in law
enforcement. ‘‘At this point, I have
no direct plans,”’ he said

ODAC changes

By MIKE SHADY
Assistant Sports Editor

 

 

The structure of Washington and
Lee’s athletic program, as well as
those of the rest of the schools in the
Old Dominion Athletic Conference,
may be in for some drastic changes.

This Monday and Tuesday, Novem-
ber 17 and 18, the athletic directors of
all 13 ODAC schools will travel to the
Ingleside Country Club in Staunton,
Virginia, for the conference’s twice-
yearly meeting. The meeting is call-
ed to take care of any business
related to the conference.

The foremost issue at this fall’s
meeting is the proposal regarding the
out of season rules and regulations
for each school’s fall, winter and
spring sports.

Three types of rules are scheduled
to be voted upon. They are:

1) The elimination of all out of
season practices. Direct coaching
supervision, the issuance of uniforms
and the top priority given teams for
the use of athletic facilities will all be
discontinued.

2) The establishment of a starting
date for each individual sport. The
fall season will begin no earlier than
August 20; the winter season on Octo-
ber 15; and the spring season on
February 1.

3) The institution of a set max-
imum number of contests or dates a
team may play. In the case of sports
such as cross country and wrestling,
meets and tournaments will be con-
sidered as one date and not as
separate contests with each par-
ticipating team. Some of the propos-
ed numbers are below those already
instituted by the NCAA.

The idea for these curbings
orginated in the mind of W&L’s
Athletic Director William McHenry.
The proposal was first voted on in a
special ODAC meeting, held at W&L,
on May 28, 1986. The idea, however,
had been on the table long before
then.

“The proposal was something we
had wanted to plan for all year but we
had no time,” said Sports Informa-
tion Director Mark Mandel. “‘So we
set aside May 28 for this specific

may come soon

meeting.”

At the meeting, Mandel said the
proposal gained approval by vote but
that it was just the initial stage. The
first vote was “unofficial’’ and only
gave the proposal the opportunity to
be discussed and voted upon ‘‘of-
ficially”’ at the upcoming meeting.

A poll of the athletic directors
revealed that at the present time, six
of the 13 ODAC schools are for the
proposal with one school, Hamp¢en-
Sydney, still undecided.

Lynchburg, Eastern Mennonite,
Emory and Henry, Maryville and
both Randolph-Macon and Randolph-
Macon Woman’s College are against
the proposal. Washington and Lee,
Roanoke, Sweet Briar, Hollins,
Bridgewater and Mary Baldwin are
the schools in favor of the sports
limitations proposal.

Many of the athletic directors
pointed out that sports limitations
are a good idea, but the National Col-
legiate Athletic Association should
have to implement the regulations,
not the ODAC conference.

“The NCAA is sufficient to govern
the conference,’ said Aubrey Moon
of Lynchburg College. ‘“There is not a
severe problem in the ODAC and the
proposal presents a_ definite
recruiting disadvantage.”

“We are NCAA oriented,”’ said Ted
Keller of Randolph-Macon College.
“Tf the NCAA eventually comes out
with the limitations, we would cer-
tainly abide by them. Then it would
be equal for everyone. Each school
should be able to take care of their
own program,” he said.

The athletic directors at
Bridgewater and Hollins both em-
phasized the importance of the con-
ference leading the way for the im-
plementation of new limitations
across the board in Division III.

Hampden-Sydney, whose vote
could prove to be the decisive one,
stil] remains undecided on the issue

‘“‘We have to examine the ins and
outs and facts and figures before we
can make a decision,’’ said Louis
Miller of Hampden-Sydney College

Extensive discussion will precede
the final vote and all views are ten-
(J See ODAC, page 4

 

he stressed.

McHenry also emphasized that
W&L was not under NCAA investiga-
tion and that it had not been forced to
forfeit its first win of the season, a
28-14 triumph at Bridgewater two

weeks ago.

“There is no investigation. There’s
nothing at all.”

Bridgewater Athletic Director

Tom Kinder said yesterday he would
not ask W&L to forfeit the game. Dan
Wooldridge, commissioner of the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference, said
it would not be proper to comment on
the conference’s position until after
the NCAA made its final decision

McHenry said Coffland approach
ed him at the start of the school year

id asked if there would be a pro
_.2m with his taking an underload of
10 credits. McHenry told him that the
NCAA required all atheletes to be
full-time students and that to take an
underload, he would need approval
from his advisor and the Faculty Ex
ecutive Committee

an appeal

The Faculty EC approved Cof
fland’s underload petition on Oct. 6,
contingent upon his taking 14 credits
in the winter term. But when the peti-
tion went before the entire faculty for
approval at its Nov. 3 meeting, Pro
fessor Samuel J. Kozak raised the
eligibility question and the petition
was tabled

McHenry could not attend the
faculty meeting because he was out
of state on family matters.

Coffland told McHenry about the
problem last Thursday. McHenry
then called Steve Horton of the NCAA
legislative services for a ruling

‘He immediately said he was in
eligible,’ said McHenry. “I had no
idea that they would rule that way

Debbie Shoemaker, a legislative
services secretary, told a Phi
reporter yesterday that a depart
mental policy prevented Horton from
dicussing the case with the student

INTENTIONAL SECOND EXPOSURE

o freebies

“This week’s “Talkback” asks the guestion, ‘“‘should the
«t)W&L Student Health Center offer free birth control?”

“This is a touchy question, to say the least (no pun intend-
»-ed). By offering birth control, some argue, students are en-
‘» couraged to take more responsibility for their actions, to

think not only of themselves, but of their partner as well.

“Free prophylactics could be beneficial in preventing the

_ noreading of disease.

“ Others claim the availability of free birth control en-

44 courages students to have sexual relations before they are
_steady. It may convey the attitude that sex before marriage
«or promiscuous behavior is acceptable, an attitude not

everyone shares.

: Moral questions aside, should the Infirmary spend money
"in order to save the student body the trouble of going to the

drugstore?

There is no problem with the idea of providing birth con-
“trol. Indeed, if it were provided, the only excuse for not using
,..it would be sheer laziness (or stupidity). Birth contol should
...be provided to those who need it and cannot otherwise afford
it. Yet the average W&L student certainly can afford to buy
= or her own birth control.

_ The present system is acceptable. The Health Center offers
“prescriptions or fittings for birth control. However, after ob-:

“taining that prescription, students must pay for the pills or

. device. (Incidentally, the Health Center has found that for
..women choosing to take birth control pills, it is cheaper to ob-
‘tain pills through the local Health Department, rather than
buy them at drugstores.) At first, this system seems biased
toward women, but when the new birth control method for
males that consists of injecting hormones into a male’s arm
becomes more widespread, perhaps then the Infirmary could
offer this method.

- If birth control methods are available over the counter, the
Infirmary should not spend part of its budget to provide these
products. It should, however, continue to offer those methods
which require the supervision of a doctor.

—MED
COUNTERPOINT

Free for all

“ The question of whether or not Washington and Lee should
‘provide birth control is, indeed, a touchy one. However, there
re a number of valid reasons that the University should
this service, the first and foremost of which is the
health and welfare of all W&L students.

~ The prevalant reason for the use of birth control is, of
course, to prevent pregnancies. However, in today’s world of
AIDS and herpes, birth control devices can become impor-
tant factors in preserving the health of students. Prophylac-
tics have been shown to decrease the chances of transmitting
diseases through sexual contact. With the threat of the AIDS
epidemic on W&L’s horizon, steps should be taken to prevent
the spread of the disease either heterosexually or homsexual-
‘ly.

Condoms are not cheap; the temptation is too great to ‘‘do
without.” By supplying them, the infirmary is helping to
avoid the spread of diseases as well as unwanted pregnan-
cies. This is not to say that a program warning students of the
‘dangers of AIDS and such should not be started. In fact, it
would only help the students.

» If the University is providing birth control devices for
thales, it is only fair to provide some option for females.
Whether birth control pills, diaphragms or sponges, females
should be afforded the same protection as males.

“If a policy such as this was to be adopted, there would un-
Joubtedly be an outcry about morality on campus being ig-
jored. However, with today’s sexually open-minded
students, the university would be doing a grave disservice to

the W&L community if it completely ignores the issue of free
birth control.

MY VIEW
By Mark Farley

 

 

 

Until recently, I did not mind get-
ting up on weekdays. In fact, I liked
it. Well, perhaps that is not entirely
true. I liked it as much as someone
who had Physics first period could
like it. That is not the case anymore.
Monday through Friday, I loath
mornings.

My hatred grew slowly, but grad-
ually. Every weekend it was nur-
tured. It wasn’t so bad at first. In the

, | could drive in at seven
forty-five and find a space in the up-
perclassman parking lot, the Corral.
And I mean a real space, not a spot
on the grass, or on the curb, but an
actual swath of pavement. I am talk-
ing about asphalt here.

Things began to change as I notic-
ed that the open parking space was a
dying breed. Sightings became rare
and when they happened, were much
talked about. I often found myself
popping the curb and pulling onto the
gravel shoulder to leave my car. I
thought that there was no way that
things could get worse. I was
definitely wrong

A few days ago at a quarter to
eight, my anger and my hatred came
to fruition. That morning, before the
bell had even rung, there were no
spaces in the Corral: no real spots, no
places on the curb, no room on the
grass, not even by the front arch —
all were taken. .

Late for an exam, I parked on Lee
Street that morning, right in front of
my fraternity house. Coming off the
Hill later that day after a long

parking spaces. We need plac *s to

I also have a class Friday after-

completing

is keeping up with the rest of the
class, It dnean’t tell him if he is doing
enough work or not, and so he can
make no time allocation decisions
that might improve his performance
for the remainder of the semester.

Things are also difficult when pro-
fessors just “estimate” grades, or
use curves that
won’t hold up around finals time.
Granted, at least the students know
something about their progress, but
as long as the professor is going to
take the time to make the estimates,
he might as well give the students
some information they can really
use.

Perhaps the worst scenario is the
one in which the professor assigns
grades which are too high or too low.
The obvious result is a bunch of very
worried students who either begin to
work their hearts out, or another
bunch who simply become secure
and work loss.

You may think that at least the

first option is good. You forget th:: '
most students have three of four ‘
other classes, and usually th» +
amount of study time available is fix,
ed. So the more a student studies fc i
one class, the less he gives to ‘h |
others. However, if a_ stud
receives bad information, he misal ' \
cates his time, and studies u.
necessarily well for one class at th
expense of the others. '
If students become mistakenly '
secure, that’s obviously bad. In that
case, they never get the signal that é
they aren’t performing wellenough.
It seems to me that if professors ,
are going to go to the effort of prepar- ,
ing mid-term grades and GPA’s they :
might as well be accurate. That way
students can make the best possible '

To the editors:

I hate to be the one to put salt on old wounds,
but someone must. I noticed one thing missing
from this year’s Parents’ Weekend, not many
parents of every minority student on campus
showed up, the turn-out would be dismal at best,
primarily because this year W&L’s minority
enrollment is less than three percent. The ad-
ministration of W&L must do something about
this problem.

As a black student, this problem really hits
close to home and frustrates me to no end. I have
heard rumors of the administration planning to
correct this problem, I feel that this effort is
not only a response to growing criticism, but it
is also occuring very late. In the past four
years, the number of incoming freshman minori-
ty students has declined steadily and this year’s
freshman class should not have only been an in-
dication of how serious the problem is, but it
should have initiated immediate action. Sending
staff members out on recruiting misions is a
start, but prospective students will only listen to
faculty and staff so much.

What we need to do is establish a minority
recruitment group, ‘made up of faculty and
students, whose sole purpose is to attract
qualified minority students to our campus. As
vice-president of the Minority Student Associa-
tion I have discussed this idea with our members
and I found that student input would be no pro-
blem and if necessary, our entire organization
would become a part of this recruitment group.

The EC’s budget this year made it quite ob-
vious that they are not willing to help with this
problem. In the budget meeting this year, we re-
quested money for a ‘‘majority weekend” which
would have not only attracted qualified minority
applicants, but would have shown white students
what it feels like to be inthe minority while going
to school, Not only did the EC shoot down this
proposal, it asked why we did not have dues for
our organization. This is simple, our participa-
tion is already low and if we charged dues it
would be even lower.

I am pleading with the administration to take
immediate action with regard to this problem, If

me or my organization can be of any assistance
we will be more than willing to assist.

Sincerely,

Dana J. Bolden

Alumnus defends Smith

To the editors:

My sincerest sympathies go out to my alma
mater. I’ve just read the October 23 edition of the
Phi, and, to my horror, I see that Markham Pyle
continues to haunt the halls of Washington and
Lee.

As a fellow member of the class of 1984, I am
sorry to see that Mr. Pyle learned nothing of
freedom of speech and respect for others opin-
ions while he was an undergraduate. It is a sad
fact that he still finds it necessary to berate the
character of individuals he, more than likely,
does not even know

Whether we agree or disagree with Paul
Smith’s opinions on the Reagan administration’s
stand on SDI at Reykiavik. we should at least
respect his right to express those opinions and be
thankful that the University community is open-
minded enough to allow expression of opposing

ts.

I do not deny Mr. Pyle’s right to express his
views on SDI, the Soviet Union, or his extensive
knowledge of modern history. However, it dis-
gusts me that he thinks he has the right to per-
sonally assault Mr. Smith for his views on any
subject. Further, for Mr. Pyle to ever assert that
he is “the voice of the Old W&L’’ is enough to
make General Lee rollover.

An integral part of Washington and Lee is pro-
viding an atmosphere for intellectual growth,
part of which is exposure to diverse ideas and
mutual respect for each individual’s ideas,
whether we agree or disagree.

This respect is inherent in the concept of honor
which is, and always will be, the foundation of
the W&L experience. There is no “‘old”’ or ‘“‘new’’
W&L. There is only one. The one that will always
embody the ideals of honor and responsibility to
others, Hopefully, as Mr. Pyle lingers on in Lex-
ington, he will eventually understand and absorb
these ideals.

Finally, congratulations to the staff of the Phi

on a job well done this year and good luck in your _

continued efforts to provide a forum for discus:
sion of all sides of the issues affecting the W&L
community.

Reader praises curriculum

To the editors:

Despite the pessimistic future of higher educa- |
tion predicted in the editorial entitled ‘“‘Faustus
U.?” in the November 6 issue of the Phi, I cannot
totally agree that ‘‘the desire to make money and
get ahead has overpowered the pursuit of higher
intellect” here at Washington and Lee. W&L-ites
may often consider their majors of utmost im-
portance while ignoring the required basics as
something to ‘‘get out of the way.”’ If “technical
training for the career they want to pursue is
overwhelming these students, then they have un-
fortunately missed out on one of the joys of
attending a small, liberal-arts college.

The general education requirements and elec-
tives account for 51-89 credits out of a necessa
121 for graduation. True, a student may choose t
concentrate his electives in his major, but at the
very minimum, 37 credits in the core curriculum
along with English composition and foreign
language proficiency is required. The “Time”
article ‘‘What Is College For?”’ suggests that the
study of ‘language, the arts, history, social and
governmental institutions and natural science”’
provides everyone “regardless of individual
goals’’ with “‘a base of essential common know-
ledge.” W&L encourages students to take classes
in certain areas of concentration, but at some
point the individual must accept the duty of for-
mulating his own comprehensive plan of study.
The University has provided the student body
with a smorgasboard of educational possibilities
in the general requirements — but it is the
responsibility of the serious student to sample
those classes that interest him and allow the

MY VIEW
By Paul J. Smith

Qingdao, People’s Republic of China.
One destoyer and two guided-missile
cruisers cruise into the harbor of
Quindao. Sailors on board wave to
their Chinese counterparts on the
docks. The U.S. Naval Band strikes
p “Happy days are here again”.
The mood is festive, as flags wave in
the wind. This visit by the U.S. Navy
is the first since 1949, when U.S.S
Dixie made its way to Hong Kong,
carrying the last American ser-
vicemen stationed in Qingdao.

The naval visit is indicative of the
changing relationship between the
U.S. and China. With an increasingly
important cultural and economic
elationship developing between the
wo countries, it is not surprising that
a military complement would soon
arise. And so it has. Not only in the
ecent example of Naval coopera-
tion, but also, and particularly in the
areas of military technology sharing.
Earlier this month, for example, the
Chinese signed an agreement to buy
$500 million in advanced U.S. radar
and other electronics for Chinese-
built F-8 jet fighters. In fact, since
1983 the Chinese have been involved
in the purchasing of military combat
cr combat support materials from
he U.S. The short-term logic of the
eagan administration’s efforts to
increase military cooperation be-
tween the two countries is obvious to
enable China to present itself as a
formidable obstacle to Soviet expan-

that fundamentally believes in its
cultural, political, and intellectual
superiority. Its desires for extended
military ties with the U.S. are on a
need-to-use basis only.

But there are those in the ad-
ministration as well as US State
Department who would argue that
they are fully aware of these
realities. They argue that the advan-
tages accrued in building up China to
face the Soviet Union far out-weight
any risks in the long run.

But the problems don’t stop there.
Basically if we rearm China we must
face the very real possibility that
China may change its military
strategy, that conceivably such
strengthening on the part of the U.S.
might lessen Peking’s fear of the
Soviet threat to its own national
security, and might, contrary to
Washington’s expectations, ac-
celerate a Peking-Moscow recon-
ciliation. Such reconciliation would
be advantageous to both parties; the
Soviets could reduce the number of
troops on the Soviet-Chinese border
and re-deploy them on the European
border against an indecisive NATO,
where they would be much more ef-
fective. The Chinese could gain con-
cessions from the Vietnamese, via
Soviet prodding, such as the con-
tested Spratly Islands in the South
China Sea, of which the Vietnamese
occupy eight, as well as border con-
cessions.

Thus an American-armed China
not only could become more entren-
ched in the Soviet camp, but could (if

it doesn’t alreau, ~ore a significant
threat to South Korea, ‘wan, and
the Phillipines.

American military policy toward
the People’s Republic should be reex-
amined by the present administra-
tion in terms of the potential long-
term impact of this unidirectional
military technological flow.

The desire for better economic and
cultural relations which are bene-
ficial to both countries should not be
confused with military cooperation,
which is marred by the fundamental
differences in political objectives and
motives that exist between the two
countries. These differences are real
and not likely to change; thus careful
consideration is warranted.

Gaines Hall scheduled for Fall’87 completion’

 

By BECKY REYNOLDS
Staff Reporter

 

Bang, crash, roar: these irritating
sounds flaring six days a week from
the corner of Washington and Nelson
Streets and beyond are actually bit-
tersweet. The noise and dust are
results of construction on the new
residence hall which will house
Washington and Lee upperclassmen
next fall.

The Gaines Residence Hall, sched-
uled to be completed by September,
1987, is named for Doctor Francis P.
Gaines. Gaines was president of the
University from 1930 to 1939.

Gaines Hall was designed by Mar-
cellus Wright Cox and Smith, the
same firm. that designed the library

 

 

and Woods Creek, Apartments,,The J]... ..+

floor plan consists of 8 single «|

bedrooms within suites, 59 double
bedrooms within suites, 21 detached
doubles and three detached singles
for a total of 248 beds. A suite consists
of various combinations of bed-
rooms, a living area, closet space
and private bathroom facilities.
However, there are no kitchen facili-
ties within each suite.

The actual structure of Gaines Hall
will consist of four progressive main
levels. It will feature a gatehouse
which will be situated directly on the
corner of Washington and Nelson
Streets. Containing comfortable
lounge furniture and perhaps a piano
for everyday use, the gatehouse will
also be used for University lectures,
concerts and meetings when needed.

There will be two other lounges
that will have small, convenience kit-
chens, as well as a computer room
with word processing equipment and
study carols, and an exercise room
on the lower level of the residence
hall. This room will serve as an alter-
native for the weight room in the
gymnasium.

The structural atmosphere of the
building will resemble the classic col-
legiate style. The main entrance will

be from a central quad. “The design

 

 

 

Artist’s conception of

of the suites gives it a lot of flexibility
with possible living set-ups for clubs,
special groups, sororities, etc. if
necessary in the future,” said Frank
A. Parsons, executive assistant to
President Wilson.

Gaines Residence Hall is just that
— a residence hall. It is not called a
dormitory “because a dormitory con-
jures up an image of long hallways
and no common space. By calling ita
residence hall, there is a degree of
gentility given,” according to Par-
sons,

Resident advisors will live in
Gaines Hall. According to Parsons,
the advisor will “maybe take on a
‘unity role’ to help get people
together as a University,” in addition
to providing information and
guidance.

Gaines Residence Hall is being

funded through an_ industrial
development bond issue. Raising
funds from individuals for the new
hall is unnecessary because the hall
should pay for itself eventually.

Rates have not been set for rooms;
however, the prices will stay in line
with other University pricing
policies. Parsons revealed that
“when W&L builds student housing,
we take a different approach beyond
freshman year because our housing
competes with housing in town. The
cost won’t go over the market rate
but will need to be sufficient to cover
the cost of Gaines.”’

When asked if he thought the new
residence would deter interest in
Woods Creek, Parsons said, ‘“‘we still
think Woods Creek will be our prime

for those who complain about the
»k of moral ethics in business prac-
es, they need look no farther than
2 Washington and Lee Business
hics Institute.
The three day program, devoted to
cussing current ethical dilemmas
nmonly faced by today’s busi-
ses, begins Friday night at 8:00 in
rthen Auditorium with a lecture
keynote speaker Elmer W. John-
“The Virtues of Managerial
ectiveness.’’ Johnson, Vice-
‘sident and General Counsel of
neral Motors Corporation, is ‘‘not
y a good speaker from a business
wpoint, but being well read in
losophy and theology, is articulate
the subject of ethics as well,”’ ac-
ding to Harlan Beckley, professor
éligion at W&L.
lembers of the University com-
nity may remember Johnson as

including a $7622 coffee-pot and a
$181 rechargeable flashlight. She also
examined the problems of spare
parts expense, such as a plastic
navigators’ stool cap which was
bought by the Air Force for $975.26,
which was made from 26 cents worth
of plastic material.

In her book, Rasor calls A. Ernest
Fitzgerald, a noted whistleblower,
her mentor. Fitzgerald, a former
cost control analyst for the Air
Force, began the current wave of
whistle-blowing when hc testified in
1968 before the Joint Economic Com-
mittee’s Subcommittee of Economy
in Government about the cost over-
runs of the C-5 plane, which was
believed to be $2 billion over the
predicted price. Fitzgerald was fired
after a reshuffle in the department of

the Air Force in which he worked.

Rasor received a B.S. in political
science and journalism from the
University of California at Berkeley.
She worked at ABC News and the Na-
tional Taxpayers Union, a non-
partisan organization which _in-
vestigates the use of tax revenues.
She left the NTU after a disagree-
ment with them over percentages
figures in an investigation.

“‘My only objectives are to stop bad
weapons from reaching the bat-
tlefield and to stop the government
from wasting taxpayers’ money,”
Rasor said of her work.

Rasor’s speech is being sponsored
by the Washington and Lee chapter
of the Society of Professional Jour-
nalists, Sigma Delta Chi, and is free
and open to the public.

By MARGARET PIMBLETT
Staff Reporter
Nearly every week, the

Washington and Lee campus is
covered with posters publicizing
fraternity parties for the weekend.
But according to Associate Dean of
Students Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy” Atkins,
the papers are unnecessary and
should not be hung.

In an interview Tuesday about
alcohol policies on campus, Atkins
said, ‘‘Fraternities shouldn't be put-
ting up posters because they
shouldn’t be having open parties.
That’s not a regulation of the Inter-
fraternity Council, but I’m positive
that every fraternity that has a
chapter on this campus has a na-
tional policy which forbids open par-
ties.”

Atkins emphasized that the policy
is not meant to be snobbish or ex-
clusive, but that insurance liability is
too great to ‘allow anybody and
everybody that wants to, to come toa
party.”

He said that the IFC prohibits

posters emphasizing alcohol. ‘There
was a policy made by the IFC at
some point in the past that posters
put up to advertise parties could not
and should not have any reference to
alcohol or the servii g of alcohol, and
that parties should not have alcohol
related themes,’’ he said.

“If you go back,’’ Atkins said, “‘to
the basic, common sense guidelines
set down by all the nationals, they
shouldn't be advertising their parties
anyway. They ought to be sending in
vitations.”’

As the director of greek affairs and
student activities, Atkins advises the
IFC. He does not administer regula-
tions to the fraternity system. ‘‘All of
the rules which govern fraternities
are made by the Interfraternity
Council,” he said.

According to Atkins the constitu-
tion and bylaws of the IFC are sub-
ject to the approval of the Student Af-
fairs Committee, an and ‘‘the IFC is
expected to discipline those frater-
nities which break the rules and don’t
comply with regulations. But, the

The Business Ethics institute is a

Ethics offered in the fall. Taught by
Beckley and Business Administra-

tive decision, dealing with issues as
varied as whistle-blowing, exporting

making it one of their foremost con-

“By teaching a course that pro-

ness they might not have otherwise
been exposed to at school.”’

The Business Ethics Institute was
introduced in 1982 as part of the
Society and the Professions pro-
gram, according to Religion Pro-
fessor Louis Hodges. Hodges, in an
effort to create a comprehensive pro-
gram in applied ethics for students
interested in various fields of study,
founded the program in 1974. Since
then, programs in applied ethics
have been given for those interested
in the fields of law, medicine, and
journalism.

Outside of the Friday night lecture,
the Business Ethics Institute is
restricted only to those students tak-
ing the course in business ethics and
guests from the business community.
Many of the guests are alumni, and
come from businesses as far away as
San Francisco.

“Not only does this give the
students a chance to discuss many of
the same problems we allude to in
class with those who deal with them
on a daily basis, but it provides in-

sight as to how these leaders, many
of them former students, handle
themselves when faced with the
ethical problems business so often
face,’’ said DeVogt.

“The issue of product safety,
especially as it concerns the Ford
Pinto, and the issue of Affirmative
Action are on the agenda as topics for
discussion. These are pressing pro-
blems for business leaders, and ones
calling for a measureable degree of
social responsibility,’’ DeVogt ad-
ded.

Should people interested in the sub-
ject still attend the lecture, given its
business-oriented nature? “By all
means,’’ said Beckley. ‘‘While
philosophers have been the keynote
speakers in the past, Mr. Johnson’s
familiarity with ethics-related pro-
blems from a business perspective is
made all the more important by his
interest in problems of philosophy
and religion. It promises to be an in-
teresting lecture.”’

Atkins stressed again the ad-
ministration’s conviction that ‘‘the
ABC laws will be obeyed at the Stu-
dent Activities Pavilion and on cam-

“We have a clear-cut set of

pavilion is that since that is universi-
ty property and the university is
sponsoring a function there when-
ever the SAB or other student organi-
zations use it for parties, the ABC
laws have got to be obeyed.’’

Atkins mentioned the idea of a beer
garden, or ‘“‘alcohol limited to a sinail
area where only a small percentage
of those people who attend could con-
sume beer. That would require a jot
of control and security, so I’m it
sure it would be worth the effort.’’

Atkins said he hoped the Student
Activities Board would begin en-
couraging a ‘‘different kind of party

Glynn Alexander and the people on
the SAB have made a really good ef-
fort to do that.”’

proposal passes, it will most assured-
ly not be in its original form.

The ODAC holds two of these
meetings every year, one in the spr-
ing and one in the fall. Besides the
new regulations, other business and
issues related to the conference will
be resolved at the meeting.

“All schools have gone home and
re-thought about the proposal and
will now revote on the same three
isues,’’ said Mandel.

“No one is taking away the
athlete’s opportunity to train or
prepare themselves for their respec-
tive sports. There just will not be any
sort of formal practices,” he said.

srs. Brown, Rimmer
and Thornton lead
football to 2nd win

;

‘ By JIM LAKE
, Staff Reporter

 

 

'

Led by senior wide receiver Randy
, Brown on offense and senior corner-
back Robert Rimmer on defense, the
’Washington and Lee football team
»recorded its second consecutive vic-
tory last Saturday, rolling over the
‘Bears of Ursinus by a score of 28-7
‘before a Parents’ Weekend crowd of
,over 5,000. Brown, the leading
receiver in the conference, caught
"nine passes for 189 of senior quarter-
«back John Thornton’s 251 passing
yards, while Rimmer intercepted
"three passes and had a total of nine
‘tackles, six of them solo.

The game started ominously for
the Generals, as the Bears blocked
“sophomore Tom Skeen’s punt deep in
: W&L territory and scored three plays
.later on a 4-yard run by quarterback

Cliff Repetti. But three minutes
‘later, the Generals tied the score
‘ with the longest run from scrimmage

in W&L history. With the ball spotted
_at the W&L 11, senior tailback Kevin

Weaver took the handoff from Thorn-

‘ton and started towards the left
tackle. He broke past the Ursinus
linebackers with some outstanding
footwork and then showed the great
‘acceleration which has given him the
lead role in the nightmares of so
many defensive coaches. The senior
tailback raced the final 50 yards com-

pletely untouched, and senior B.J.

Sturgill added the extra point that

tied the score with 8:13 remaining in
the first quarter. The Generals would
never trail again.

In the second quarter, the Generals
took advantage of the Bears’ preoc-
cupation with Weaver. The Ursinus
defensive scheme was to ‘‘put an out-
side linebacker right in the middle,
and wherever Kevin went, he went,”

according to head coach Gary
Fallon. The Bears thus left
themselves with single coverage on
Brown, and sophomore cornerback
Steve Sacco was completely over-
matched by the speedy and ex-
perienced senior. Brown pulled in a
40-yard pass from Thornton which
put the Generals in scoring position,
and Brown scored seconds later on a
37-yarder. Sturgill’s extra point clos-
ed out the first half scoring with the
Generals in command, 14-7.

In the second half, the Bears drop-
ped back into a more balanced
defense, allowing the Generals to
return to the ground game and the
ball-control offense which they have
used most of the season. Two second-
half interceptions by Rimmer and
one by senior safety Joe Krastel
allowed W&L to keep the ball on the
ground and run time off the clock.

The Generals extended their lead
on a 7-yard run by Weaver for his se-
cond score of the day. Sturgill added
the extra point with 1:29 remaining in
the third period, and W&L went up by
14. Junior running back John Roe
scored his first touchdown of the
season from 32 yards out with 1:51 re-
maining in the game to nail down the
victory. The win lifted the Generals
overall record to 2-6.

The Generals will close out their
1986 season this Saturday afternoon
in Meadville, Pennsylvania, with
their first game ever against
Allegheny College. The Gators are
5-4, coming off of a 23-0 shutout by
Grove City. Fallon said that the
Gators have a big defensive front
with an aggressive secondary.
Allegheny will ‘give us quite a test
for out offense,’’ predicted Fallon.

Offensively, the Gators feature two
outstanding tailbacks. ‘‘They’ve got
an explosive attack utilizing those
two’’ in tandem, said Fallon, with a
capable freshman at quarterback.

“They have a chance at a winning
season and will give an all-out ef-
fort,” said Fallon. ‘In order to win,
we must maintain our aggressive-
ness and intensity.”’

HASHMARKS — This was the
twelfth game in Weaver’s career in
which he has rushed for over 100
yards, Before he gained 146 yards on

captain sang the national anthem...

Shades on sports

Assistant Sports Editor

Limitations? You bet

When the athletic directors of each ODAC school meet this Monday
and Tuesday, a proposal will be put on the table that, if passed, will
severely restrict the out-of-season goings on in the sports programs of
those respective schools. The proposal is long overdue.

Take a look around you. How many two or three sport athletes do
you see? Not many, and the number is declining every year. In this
marvelous age of specialization, an athlete has no choice but to follow
the trend and cut down his participation to just one sport. The
demands, out of season, are just too high for an athlete to meet. So in-
stead of risking the wrath of the coaches, the athlete decides to limit
himself to only one sport.

Wake up Shades, this stuff doesn’t happen in Division III, does it?

Unfortunately, even D-III isn’t safe. National championships are na-
tional championships, be it D-I or D-III, and the coaches are just as
willing to make the sacrifices necessary to obtain these coveted titles.
Suddenly the season isn’t long enough and other measures must be
taken in order to produce a winner.

Wait just a minute. Are you saying there is something wrong with a
winner? Get a grip, Shades. Winners, not losers, are what people want
to see.

The problem is that D-III sports is not designed for this win-at-all-
costs philosophy. Call me a romantic, but I’ve always thought (and
still do) that D-III athletes play the sport because they enjoy it; not to
win national championships or All-America awards.

The major criticism of the proposal is that it leaves the conference
at a disadvantage against competition outside the conference (Read:
we won’t win any non-conference games, thus, no tournament bids).
Another point mentioned is that the athlete is being denied the oppor-
tunity to become the best he can be.

Nothing could be further from the truth. More than once I have
heard D-III athletes compiain about practices with the age old state-
ment, ‘“‘We’re only Division III, so I can’t believe we have to practice
so hard.”

If an athlete wants to train or practice out of season, it can be done
on his own time and when he wants to do it. If he wants it bad enough,
the hours of work will be put in and the performances will, as a result,
be enhanced. He doesn’t need some power-hungry coach who only
cares about ‘‘W’s”’ telling him to get his butt in gear.

If the national championships come, fine. I’ll welcome them with
open arms. But at the D-III level, academics is first and foremost. It’s
not fair for the few who have to put in the out-of-season time (as if the
in-season time is not enough) when they don’t want to just because the
coach will be upset.

That’s what D-I and D-II athletics are all about. It’s about time that

something is instituted that ensures that D-III does not fall into the
same mold. Fun, excitement and an emphasis placed upon
academics; that’s what D-III sports are all about. That’s the way it
should be. Period.
NOTES: Sugar Ray Leonard will receive $11 million to fight
“Marvelous” Marvin Hagler next April. Sure, Leonard is fighting
Hagler because he felt it is in his soul. Sounds more like the feeling is
in his wallet to me... Life in the NBA: Sikma or no Sikma, Milwaukee
is still the doughnut team. The team without a center...

 

 

Four school records fall as swimmers make wavesin opener

By MATHEW HORRIDGE
Staff Reporter

The 1986-1987 men’s and women’s
, Swimming season opened in an im-
pressive fashion last night with the
“women recording their first victory
‘and the men breaking four school
‘records.

The women defeated Mary
‘Baldwin, 101-69, and the men beat
, their cross-town rivals VMI, 121-84.
The Generals won every race in the
‘contest.

The 400-yard medley relay team,
composed of David Olson, Martin
‘Radvany, David Dietz and Jeff Ber-
‘caw, qualified for the national Divi-
, Sion III championships with a time of
3:34.69. The relay team also broke
,the eight-year-old school record of
3:35.69.

Freshman David Olson, in his first
,race as a W&L swimmer, broke the
,school record for the 100-yard
backstroke (54.07) while swimming

the first leg of the 400 medley relay
_race. Olson qualified for nationals in
the 200-yard backstroke with a time
of 1:57.82, which broke the school
record held by senior Jay ReVille.

Sophomore David Reavy perform-
,ed a similar feat in the 200-yard
freestyle race by qualifying for na-
tionals with a school-record time of
1:43.84.

In the 50-yard freestyle race,
| sophomore Jeff Bercaw qualified for

The Generals held tough for two

The weekend — the season — end-
ed on a high note with an 11-6 victory
over Harvard.

“lam very pleased with the way
we played this weekend,”’ said head
coach Page Remillard.

The Generals placed seventh in the
tournament and finished the season
with a 21-11 record.

Co-captain Simon Perez said the
Generals had a good season.

“The water polo seaon was suc- |”

cessful because we had 21 wins
— more [wins in a season] than in the
last two years,”’ he said., ‘‘but we feel
we didn’t play up to our potential.”’

Remillard echoed Perez’s
thoughts: ‘“‘We improved throughout
the season...[and] we are looking for-
ward to continuing our improvement
next year.”

The Generals’ team this year was
composed mainly of freshmen and
sophomores and will lose only three
players to graduation in June.

| Athletic Director McHenry speaks out about his ODAC sports limitations proposal

 

 

Interview by Mike Shady
Compiled by David Emrich

Ring-tum Phi: When did you first think of the proposal?

Athletic Director William McHenry: My concern, for
several years, has been the abuses that are taking place
in intercollegiate athletics. Not necessarily at
Washington and Lee at all because I don’t think in any
way do we abuse the length of the seasons. I think the
seasons are too long and we’re asking our athletes to
participate in too many games. I think that out of
season practice is infringing upon their rights to par-
ticipate in other sports. I have been concerned with this
for probably four or five years.

R: When you first drew up the proposal did you expect
opposition from other athletic directors in the con-
ference?

M: Absolutely. First of all, let me say, I spoke on the
NCAA floor to the Division III athletic directors on two
occasions on this subject and was to by the other
athletic directors: This is a great idea, these are things

that should be done for Division III, but we can’t do it
for a particular sport — which is the sport of their in-
terest. When I proposed this to the athletic directors of
the conference, | was appointed as the chair of an ad-
hoc committee. There was almost unanimous accep-
tance of the recommendations that we made. I fully ex-
pected that there would be some opposition after we had
made the recommendations.

R: Some athletic directors feel that the present NCAA
rules are good enough. Why should the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference be any different?

M: I felt that perhaps if the ODAC took a leadership role
in the NCAA that we could show that we have some con
cerns as a conference — not just Bill McHenry as
athletic director — that we have concerns about the
abusive times involved with athletic problems

R: Some of the other athletic directors in the ODAC also
feel that if some changes were made in the original pro
posal that they would pass it. Would you make some
concessions inorder to get this thing passed?

M: Absolutely. This is on the floor for discussion. My in-
tent when we drew this thing up was to take it back to
the coaching staffs and ask them to shoot whatever
holes into it they want, and for us to come up with a pro-
posal that is acceptable and yet would take care of some
of the problems. I am concerned with a growing trend of
more and more out of season games and more and more
time for out of season practices by other institutions.
It’s the old story you have to keep up with the
Joneses, you have to do what they do or you’re going to
lose ground and that’s not the right attitude, as far as
I’m concerned

R: If the proposal fails, what would be the next step?

M: If the proposal fails entirely it would be a dead issue,
and I would continue to work through the NCAA to try to
have some legislation passed to put some sanity into
Division III sports programs

R: If the proposal passes, what do you think would be
the reaction of athletes and coaches, especially here at

Washington and Lee?

M: I can’t see how any of our sports would be affected
negatively with the possible exception of our tennis pro-
gram, which has a very good fall program and that’s a
unique situation because our tennis coach is also our
wrestling coach and he loses preseason time in the spr-
ingtime. Our lacrosse team is trying to establish itself
as a strong Division III team and they may be han-
dicapped, and there may be some others. Golf has a
program that would be affected slightly. But, there are
certainly differences that you should consider, between
perhaps individual sports and team sports and that’s
one thing that hasn’t been addressed here in this pro
posal

R: Do you think that if the proposal passes that other
conferences in the country of the NCAA as a whole will
follow suit?

M: Well, I don’t know if they’ll follow suit but I think
what our job will be as administrators is to try to show
that this can work and be effective so that other people
will want to do the same thing. The only way it will ever
really be totally successful is if it’s done on a national

basis.

Bruce offers treasure chest

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Entertainment Editor

Well, it’s here

Bruce Springsteen and the E Street
Band Live/1975-85. Five records,
three cassettes, or three compact
discs of live Bruce Springsteen. The
digitally mastered bootleg album of
your wildest dreams. A_ treasure
chest for the faithful. The New Testa
ment of the MTV generation. The last
Christmas gift on earth

There are 40 tracks, so if anything
is missing, you can’t blame Columbia
records for not trying. You name it
and it’s on here. Everything from
“Thunder Road” to ‘‘Racing In the
Street,’ from ‘Born To Run’ to
“Born In the U.S.A.” is packed on
this massive set, all pristinely mixed
and charged with as much “‘live”’ ex
citment as can be coaxed from a
piece of vinyl

Sophomore Tony Waskiewicz, on of
the faithful, bought Lexington’s first
copy last Tuesday at the Flipside
record store. He called it “the icing
on the cake *

Lexington resident Jane Horton
Marcella bought a copy for her hus-
band, saying, “It’s sort of our
history. My husband and I met in col
lege in '75-'76 and it is interesting for
us to follow this along.”’

Although not necessarily a Spring
steen fanatic, third year law student
Ed Graham bought a copy on the
basis of seeing the Boss live.

“Tt was the best live show I’ve ever
seen,” he said.

Flipside owner Bill Cooper said his
store originally ordered 36 copies: 13
lp’s, 19 cassettes and 4 CDs. His Tues
day order was short, however, as he
only received half the number of Ip’s
and CDs he ordered.

“I’m not sure we could have done
any better getting things in,’’ Cooper
said. “If our su pliers are short, than
the customers come up short.’

The set is selling for $28.19 in lp and
cassette and $49.19 in CD. The store’s
mark-up for the CD is, according '
Cooper, less than that of the cassette

Cooper said Columia records does
not have its own CD pressing plant;
rather, all its compact discs are
pressed in a Sony plant in Indiana
Apparently, once this initial pressing
is sold out, there won’t be anymore
CDs until January.

Columbia’s first printing is some
