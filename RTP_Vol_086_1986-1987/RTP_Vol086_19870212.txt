Trustees vote to raise tuition

By MARGARET PIMBLETT
Staff Reporter

 

Tuition at Washington and Lee will
rise next year to $8,300, an increase
of 9.2 percent.

The Board of Trustees approved
the increase at its annual midwinter
meeting last weekend.

The increase in tuition raises the
comprehensive fee including tuition,
room, board and student activity fee
to $11,708, with an average room rent
of $1,383 and a 20-meal contract of
$1,925.

The trustees also approved the
largest financial aid budget in the

University’s history. W&L will award
a total of $2,973,000 in aid, drawing
primarily from restricted scholar-
ship endowment and gifts specified
for financial aid.

Tuition income does not fund the
student financial aid budget.

President John D. Wilson informed
parents of W&L students of the tui-
tion increase in a letter dated Feb. 11.
He said, ‘The Board considered
every reasonable option before adop-
ting next year’s tuition figure.”

Wilson also added that, in order to
protect the school’s assets, the
University uses a conservative for-
mula to decide how much of the en-
dowment earnings should be used for

Superdance is
big success

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Assignments Editor

 

Before 2 a.m. Sunday, no one knew
if Washington and Lee would surpass
its $30,000 goal at the school’s ninth-
annual Muscular Dystrophy Associa-
tion Superdance.

But when the final total was posted,
the answer was more than clear even
for the bleary-eyed at the Student Ac-
tivities Pavilion.

Bolstered by an outstanding turn-
out for the White Animals, students
this year raised $33,152. That figure
should once again make W&L one of

*“the’nation’s top per capita college

contributors to MDA.

Although it was not a record-
setting performance, this marked the
ninth straight year that W&L met its
goal. The record for a W&L Super-
dance is $35,200, set in 1984.

“IT am so proud of this year’s
chairmen and their committees,”’
said Fontanne Bostic, adviser to the
Superdance steering committee.
“The reason this year’s Superdance
was such a success was because their
organization was so great.”’

Bostic, Co-Chairmen Tom Thagard
and Jim Barker, and the other
organizers of the event had worried
that the increased drinking age
would hurt this year’s dance,
possibly making it dry. But a beer

license was granted a few weeks ago,
and their fears proved unwarranted.

They also shortened the dance
from 30 to 18 hours in an effort to at-
tract more dancers. Barker said
there were 160 dancers this year,
about 10 more than last year.

Margaret M. Pimblett, a soph-
omore from Newport News, Va., won
a trip to the Virgin Islands for collec-
ting the most pledge money. She said
she raised almost $950.

“I’m not sure how much money I
raised because I was still out getting
sponsors at fraternity parties Friday
night,’’ Pimblett said.

She was followed by Nicole
Liarakos, a freshman from Wil-
mington, Del., and Jeff Mandak, a
senior from Clifton, N.J.

Kenneth Craig Smith Jr. a
sophomore from Shreveport, La.,
won a prize for the most cash col-
lected.

Catherine M. Boardman, a soph-
omore from Bedford, Va., won the
raffle for a hydrobard.

Last year’s dance raised more than
$34,000, Barker said, but about $5,000
of that came from a car raffle. No car
raffle was held this year, he said, so
he was glad to be able to raise so
much.

The only negative part of the
dance, Barker said, was that some of
the dancers weren’t dancing, and
others left during the dance.

Freshman

is killed

in auto accident

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Assignments Editor

 

A Washington and Lee freshman
died early Tuesday morning in a
single-car accident on U.S. 11 north
of Natural Bridge.

Virginia State Trooper P.C. Gard-
ner said that Daniel E. Martin, 19, of
Lexington, Ky., was traveling south
at a high rate of speed when he lost
control of his car and skidded off the
right side of the road, three-tenths of
a mile north of the intersection of
U.S. 11 and Virginia 130.

Gardner said that Martin’s auto, a
1986 Nissan 300ZX, became airborne
and struck some trees. Martin, who
was not wearing a seatbelt, was
thrown from the vehicle and ap-
parently died on impact.

Gardner said that Martin was
found by a deputy sheriff at about

1:30 a.m. He estimated the time of .

the accident at 1:15.

He said he found no evidence that
alcohol was a factor. As is the case in
all accidents, a blood test is being
performed. Results are expected in a
week to ten days.

Dr. F.A. Feddeman, county medi-
cal examiner, said the cause of death
was a fractured neck

Martin, a 1985 graduate of Henry
Clay High School, was a pledge at the
Kappa Alpha fraternity. John K.
Hudson Jr., president of the house,
said he was told by fraternity
brothers that Martin had been there
until about midnight.

He said Martin had been drinking
beer and that some of the brothers
had asked him if he wanted a ride. He
said Martin told them that he was
alright and planned to return directly
to the dorms.

Mathew Laws, Martin's dorm
counselor, said that Martin would go

current needs. The effects of the 1986
tax reform bill on philanthropy are
yet to be seen, so the trustees con-
cluded that gift expectations should
not be overestimated, said Wilson

“The main sources of pressure on
the projected budget,’’ Wilson said,
“come from our decision to add key
new faculty positions, to improve our
national standing in compensation
for our faculty and staff, and to ac-
celerate the computer development
of the undergraduate schools and the
School of Law.”

The search to fill some of those new
faculty positions has already started,
according to Wilson. The positions in
clude professorships in Russian

 

history, art history, chemistry, and
business administration.

W&L’s 1985-86 combined salary
and benefits for faculty ranged for
$22,545 for instructors to $49,467 for
professors with an average compen-
sation of $41,846. Those figures com-
pare to average faculty compensa-
tion of $53,186 at Duke, $41,727
at Davidson, Hampden-Sydney’s
$33,820, and $51,799 at Princeton.

Wilson said that Washington and
Lee’s tuition and fees ‘tare amongst
the lowest in the nation when com-
pared with other independent institu-
tions of the first rank.”

In a guide published last year by
“The New York Times,’’ W&L was

named one of the ‘‘best buys’’ among
the nation’s colleges and univer-
sities,

The total charges for 1986-87 for
some other schools were:

eDavidson $11,075
«Georgetown $13,700
eHampden-Sydney $10,875
eUniversity of Richmond $10,075
*UVA (non resident ) $ 8,036
eWilliam and Mary $9,986

In his letter, Wilson also told the
parents about the general state of the
university.

The admissions office has received
more than 3,200 applications for the

an “Buddy” Atkins gets his just desserts.

He said that dancers who left and
came back were not admitted unless
they paid the $8 entry fee. He also
said that fewer dancers left than in
past years as a result of the shorten-
ed hours.

The dance began at 8 a.m. with
music from WLUR-FM, which held a

concurrent, 20-hour radio marathon.
WLUR staffers gave live reports
from the pavilion.

Speidel, Goodrich & Lille, an ac-
coustic trio from Charlottesville,

followed by the funky sounds of
Covacus at 8 p.m. and winding up

Wilson on state of the university

By PETER BOATNER
Staff Reporter

 

From the comfort of his suite of of-
fices in Washington Hall, President
Wilson’s view of the future for W&L

is bright indeed.
Reaction to co-education overall is
‘“‘positive,’’ fraternities are

“stronger than ever,” and W&L’s ap-
peal to high school seniors is ‘really
astonishing,’’ in Wilson’s view.

In an interview in the comfortable
green leather chairs of his office,
with WLUR’s morning classics show
playing softly in the background, he

Memorial Fund at W&l

 

outlined his perception of the major
issues facing the school today, and
tomorrow.

First and foremost, co-education is
a battle President Wilson thinks has
been fought and won at W&L.

“T think every visible sign is
positive,’’ Wilson said. ‘“There are, of
course, people who complain, but the
women are being accepted and the
men have been gracious in accepting
them...I received a letter (from a stu-
dent) just the other day saying how
he thinks co-education is strengthen-
ing the university.”

“You can’t have changes without a
few bumps, but if you look at last

year’s freshman class, of the 105
women who matriculated, 102 return-
ed. That’s a high retention rate.”

“T just don’t understand” the peo-
ple who complain against co-educa-
tion, such as in letters to the Phi, he
said. “I don’t know where they're
coming from.”’

“The women have been a positive
asset to the school. Look at the
sophomore women. They started a
soccer team last year, and they are
only a hundred of them...they’re very
aggresive.”

-OPINION

The Ring-tum Phi, February 12, 1987

 

Reasoning

Judging from the way he views the state of Washington and
Lee, it is obvious that Dr. Wilson views the University solely
from his office in Washington Hall, an office with rose-
colored windows.

Wilson is entitled to his views, but one wonders how he for-
mulates them. Rarely, these days, is the president seen walk-
ing around campus having informal chats with students to
discover what their opinions of his administration are. Many

‘students have valid criticisms of the way Washington and

' Lee is headed. The students with the strongest opinions ap-

: pear to be upperclassmen who have been witness to a

metamorphosis of a university. Does Dr. Wilson take their

opinions into account or does he dismiss them simply

because they are, for the most part, opponents of coeduca-
tion?

Washington and Lee is not an academic utopia and increas-
ing the size of the student body will not make it one.
_ The size of the student body is approaching what it was in
the mid 1970s. But the administration is going to have to come
. up with a better reason than that for continuing on this
course. To return Washington and Lee to what it was in the
1970s would mean the University would, once again, be all
- male. Is this what Dr. Wilson wants?

.  Theclass of 1991 will have 420 students in it. If the class size
» remains constant, within four years the size of the student
~ body would be 1680. If the law school is included, total enroll-
‘ ment approaches, if not surpasses, 2,000. This is a far cry
from the 1742 who went to Washington and Lee in the 1970s.

. Bigger is not always better. If Dr. Wilson and the ad-
ministration persist in their quest to enlarge what does not

-- need to be enlarged, they are going to have to come up with
~’ some damn good reasons for doing so.

‘Platoon’: just another Vietnam
movie? Or something else...?

 

MY VIEW
By Paul J. Smith

When it was over, I could not move.
My body was drained of all energy,
Shaken to its depths. I could do
nothing but stare, stare at a screen of
names, of tributes, to people who had
contributed to this monumental ef-
fort to heal America of her wounds.

On the surface, it was a rather sim-
ple story, a story of a young man
similar to any one of my classmates
who wanted to find his place in this
world, to find his purpose. Compelled
by idealism and zealous patriotism,
he rejects a rather secure and predic-
table life as a university student, for
a life of certain danger, of almost
certain death.

But this is more than a movie, I
think to myself, as the heavy laden
music continues. A woman two seats
in front of me is wiping her eyes. Did
she lose a loved one? A husband. A
father. I do not ask.

I doubt Ronald Reagan will watch
Platoon, or take it seriously. There is
no Star Spangled Banner to stir one
into patriotic euphoria. No flags, no
waving, no apple pie. Just the om-
nipresence of decaying bodies that
once possessed life, and the poignant
final scene where the bodies are be-
ing buried, like dead cockroaches, in-
to a huge impersonal hole.

“Is Platoon realistic?” I hear it
asked everywhere. But how can

someone in my generation know? We
never served in Vietnam. We are the
children of Vietnam, of a national
tragedy. Hazy to our minds are the
countless images of young men being
slaughtered in a horrendously hot
and humid tropical climate. Some-
what more clear are the memories of
the anti-war movement, protest mar-
ches held by university students who
through their money and power
would evade the draft anyway. Then
there was the violence at Kent State,
the ubiquitous slogans that
permeated the movement, ‘‘Hell No,
We won't go!”’, of the hippies who
would evolve into yuppies, of corrupt
well-dressed politicians.

It was a different era. It became
part of my history books. And now it
was gone, and except for occasional
reminders such as this movie, it
would leave my consciousness until
the next Vietnam movie came along.
Certainly, I thought to myself as I ex-
ited that theatre, we learned our
lesson this time. Certainly, I convinc-
ed myself, we wouldn’t make the
same mistake twice.

That night I went to sleep. I had a
dream. It was unlike any dream I
had before. It was remarkably clear
and vivid, with piercingly sharp im-
ages. I was aboard a helicopter tak-
ing off from a misty black tropical
forest which my eyes could not
penetrate. I was in uniform, with
weapon in hand. I could finally
ee ee ae

t

“John” reaches over and shouts that

we are landing; I can barely hear the
voices cround me and coming over the
radio, due to the roar of the engine.
“That's the enemy,” he shouts. I finally
recognize him. He is a classmate, who
majored in English. “How do you
know,” I shout back. “I can understand
what they are saying. I took four years
of Spanish.” Images are waxing and
fading in my eyes. I am disoriented. As
we land, | can make out the images of
tanks across the field.

The we all hear a voice. “Men,” the
voice proceeds, “We are here to serve as
advisors to our contra friends and aid

them against the struggle against the
communist menace.”

As we proceed to the line of departure
for the final inspection, I look around
and see thousands of my compatriots,
in uniforms, with weapons in hand. But
there are no faces. Just bodies, some-
how standing suspended in the air.
“They are dead,” says a spectating pea-
sant farmer. “They came here to die for
a cause their government could not pro-
ve, and for principles their government
did not itself believe. They were used.
Used. They died because old men in
high places were too proud to com-
promise. /Que lastima!” He turns away
and walks into the mist.

We are then ordered to pack the
bodies away, into the bags, to be ship-
ped home. There are few of us, many of
them. As we pack, we recognize some
who we once knew, some who wanted to
change this world, to somehow make it
better. For each body we see, we feel the
utter loss of one more dream shattered,
of one more set of hopes annihilated in.

 

to the oblivion of a pungent rotting
corpse.

“Oh God, why couldn't we have fore-
seen this. Why did we think it wouldn't”
happen to our generation.” John
laments, “Why did we let our govern-
ment do this to us?”

“God John, | don’t know. I just don't
know." I break down.

I cry out from my bed, waking in a
sheet soaked in sweat. My face is red,
my hands soaked. I look around my .
room, I see the familiar posters, the
pictures of family and friends. As I
suddenly remember the movie I had
seen the night before, my stomach
coils as though it were going to tie
itself into a knot.

Then it hits me like a wave of
thunder pounding against my head;
“Platoon” is not a movie about Viet-
nam. It is a warning. It is a warning
to all those who believe that the
government is right most of the time,
or even some of the time. It is a warn-
ing those willing to entrust their lives -
within a body of myopic policy-
makers who live in a fantasy world
within the Washington beltway
where the illusion of American invin-
cibility is fostered. It is a warning to
those who support the administra-
tion’s policies in Central America,
Iran, South Africa, Chile, South
Korea etc...and who don’t question °
the wisdom of such policies. It is a
warning against blind faith. As one

great American, Bruce Springsteen, |
said “It will get you killed.” You can
bet on it. As sure as the sun will rise
tomorrow.

Gordon’s

-MY VIEW
? By Susan Lewis

 

 

I must admit that I was thoroughly

*. surprised upon reading the letter to

the editor last week, “‘Reader no

. longer supports coeducation.’’ Last
‘. year I might not have been so shock-
. ed in seeing a letter like that, since
». feelings concerning coeducation
‘'. were much more pronounced. It is
». not that I object to anyone expressing

their opinion on coeducation and how

‘. it has been working out. Believe it or
» not, I, as a sophomore female, can
. understand that some peopie still
'. don’t and never will agree with the
. decision of July 15, 1985. I also can

respect their opinion and their view

» of Washington and Lee as it once was

— as long as their opinion is backed

up with sound, logical argument.

: Unfortunately, I honestly believe
: Mr. Gordon has no such argument. I
admit that I was slightly angry and
upset after my first reading of the let-
ter. But when I went back and reread
it, I was struck by its lack of
sensibility. In the first place, it seems
to me that a male on campus should
be just as insulted as females.
Perhaps I have been taking the
wrong classes, but I have yet to see
any males “cringe and blubber
dotingly, mesmerized by the
presence of their mother image three
seats over.’’.On the contrary, it has

- seemed tome that everyone has par-

ticipated equally in my classes — and
the males probably more so since
they are a larger percentage. I find it
exceedingly hard to believe, con-
sidering the caliber of the students at
this school, that women in a class-
room have such an adverse effect on
| men that the men can no longer think
‘or learn at all. Even if it were true, I
‘wouldn’t want all of the campus to
‘know that I can no longer concen-
‘trate simply because of someone of
‘the opposite sex was sitting in the
same room with me.
} Second, Mr. Gordon asks that the
tadministration take a _ refresher

course in Econ 101. Perhaps now is
the time to review yet again the
statistics behind his idea of supply
and demand for an all-male universi-
ty. (I know, I know, we have all heard
the statistics about this until we are
ready to scream, but obviously it
can’t hurt to say them once again.) A
low supply of any item yields a high
demand only if there is just that — a
high demand. Just because there is a
low supply does not guarantee a high
demand. In fact, there could be a low
supply because there is a low de-
mand — which is, I believe, the case
here. The numbers in both applica-
tions and enrollment show clearly
and without a doubt that the demand
for a prestegious coed university is
much, much higher than the demand
for a prestigious all-male university.

Finally, there is the question of the
comparison of W&L admitting
women to Coke changing its formula.
The Coca-Cola Company did indeed
realize they had made a mistake and
brought back Coke Classic. The pro-
blem here is that the public opinion in
favor of Coke Classic was over-
whelming, and the public opinion in
favor of ‘‘W&L Classic’’ does not ap-
pear to be. If it is, there certainly are
a number of people hiding in the
background and not voicing their
opinion. If Mr. Gordon is indeed
representing the majority student
opinion as he so firmly believes, then
why was this letter such a shock to
the women of W&L? As the “mis-
take” on campus, shouldn’t we have
realized that so many people regret-
ted and even resented our presence
here? I find it hard to believe that the
opinion of the student body is
represented in saying ‘‘Give us back
W&L Classic.”

I suppose that Mr. Gordon will not
listen to my arguments since I never
have been, nor deserve to be, but I
stand as having objected to his letter.
I object not only because his own
arguements are pointless and weak,
but also because I do consider myself
a part of this university. I love
Washington and Lee and what it
stands for no less than any male on
campus. Let Mr. Gordon scoff at my

presumptuousness if he must.

To the Editors:

It seems that this will be annual tradition.
Somme readers may recall my letter
decrying the action of the “participants” in the

Washington and Lee Muscular Dystrophy
Association Superdance.

Once again, this year I participated not in a
superdance, but in a super-spectate. The Super-
dance was publicized as an 18 hour dance
marathon, not 18 or fewer hours of sitting in the
Pavilion, making excuses for not moving.

The individuals who participated as registered
dancers had an obligation to their sponsors to at
least attempt to dance the entire 18 hours of the
event. True, many sponsors pledged a flat
amount rather than attaching a per-hour stipula-
tion, but those people generous enough to donate
their money to this very worthy cause rightfully
expected to have the dancers actually standing
up, perhaps even moving their feet in time with
the music. That should not mean only while the
bands are playing. It should include the time
when WLUR is broadcasting to the pavilion or
taped music is being played.

Some of the dancers complained about this
year's policy of requiring dancers who left the
pavilion to pay the regular admission price to re-
enter. Any dancer whe left forfeited his rights as
a registered participant-no free drinks, no free
food, and no admittance to the dancers’ ring.
Their sponsors were being charged for 18 hours
of dancing, not for six hours of dancing, six hours
of talking, and six hours of sleeping.

I realize that some of the young men who
registered to dance did so not out of the
of their altruistic principles, But were ‘“‘urged”’
by their fraternities to participate. A commen-
dable action, since the dance would most likely
lose thousands of dollars if those freshmen were
not required to obtain donations. However, I sub-
mit that those same fraternities should also
“urge” their pledges to dance, not just sit on the
bleachers or stand around conversing. It is possi-
ble to dance and talk at the same time.

I salute all the members of the Superdance
Steering Committee who worked for months
organizing the event, and particularly Jim
Baker and Tom Thagard, the co-chairmen. They
are to be applauded for surpassing their fun-
draising goal and raising more than $33,000 for
charity.

My sincere hope is that the W&L MDA Super-
dance will eventually live up to its name and
reputation and that its participants will truly
“Dance for those who can’t.”

Sincerely,
Margaret M. Pimblett, ’89

Reader wants all-male W&L

To the Editor

The mini-series ‘‘Amerika”’ details the horrors
of a Soviet occupation. Presumably, the drastic
changes the foreign domination force the
American people to revolt and resurrect the
status quo ante.

We can only hope that the W&L community

 

 

LETTERS

will rise against its occupation and liberate
itself. vr

As freshmen, w@were reminded that Gen. Lee
stated “Young , we have no printed
rules. We have but one rule here, and it is that
every student be a gentlemen.” That was
enough. That guided daily life here, and W&L
was a community based on gentlemanly trust,
mutual respect and comradeship. So happy were
those days that we grew complacent, and neede
some shaking up. After all, minds resistant to
positive change are stale, brittle.

What did we get? The shake-up shattered the
foundations upon which the school rested. Listen
to the results. A faculty member: ‘This place
has become so bureaucratized, like some state
school it is not... it is so un-W&L.” A 27-year staf-
fer: ‘There used to be comeraderie here, and we
don’t have it any more.” A student: “‘If it ain’t
broke, don’t fix it; why coeducation if the school
was a success before? We’re just another preten-
tious little school, with girls.”

New rules mean to protect us from ourselves,
not maintain order among gentleman. Is a W&L
student less capable of handling himself today
than, say, four years ago? He now must lock his
doors, hide his wallet, avoid kegs, attend date-
rape seminars to discover his innate violent,
predatory nature. And we thought the school
meant”’gentlemen.”’ Today we hear “Thou Shalt
Not,” and have to jump for our own good. So too
the faculty, which tires of petty administrative
interference.

Not long ago, even on a campus with 17 frater-
nities and diverse students, unity was a
hallmark. Snobbery and cliquishness were indiv-
dual aberrations. Now they are systemic. Up-
perclassmen remember when it wasn’t a social
sin to befriend a rival Greek or independant. (We
are forbidden to from open parties, as if in-
surance liability makes comradeship too
dangerous.) And how many cat-fights, girls,
over matters academic and honorable, social
and sexual? Truly, the new W&L fosters the com-
radship of the kindergarten; Gen. Lee be damn-
ed.

Let’s get some things straight.

Single-sex education is not sexist. It does not
promote a ‘‘separate-but-equal’”’ standard as if
girls were seoond-rate citizens.

Coeducation hasn’t enlightened the W&L man.
Instead it has brought sexism to Lexington and
embittered him.

Efforts to make girls feel at home, and that
they “‘improve”’ the school are insulting. The im-
plication is that we were selfish, or the old W&L
had no place in the 20th century.

Coeducation’s opponents are not misogynists,
closet homos, mama’s boys or chauvinists afraid
of women. To dismiss arguments forsingle-sex
education as fulminations by frustrated semi-
perverts and reactionaries misses the mark.

But that is now the standard response to any
efforts to intelligent discussion. This type of
name-calling would not have happened at the old
W4&L. Can you blame us for missing that institu-
tion?

“Washington and Lee enjoys freedom from
outside control. The university is free to chart its
own course, consistent with the highest educa-
tional standards, its traditions and its arms of
service to mankind.”’ (University Catalog)

The new era of outside - read un-W&L - control
is at hand. Those words are increasingly hollow.
To give them meaning again, students, faculty
and alumni should remove those people,at-

Superdancers are obligated to dance

titudes, and policies wrecking this institution.
Replace rules with trust. Reopen fraternitypar-
ties. Reanimate comeraderie. Repeal coeduca-
tion.

Shades is enlightened

To The Editors:

I have always been amused by Mike Shady’s
column “‘Shades On Sports.”’ In fact, I’ve alwavs
felt that his provincial, myopic insight has added
an almost fractional dimension to the W&L
paper.

What mortifies me though is Mr. Shady’s
judgemental attitude. I couldn’t actually bring
myself to believe that he finds yacht racing
anything less than exciting! Until I realized
where Mr. Shady is from. Pennsylvania! Mind
you, I have nothing against Pennsylvania; my
brother lives there. In Pittsburgh, no less! Mr.
Shady’s lack of appreciation for one of
America’s most heralded sports probably hinges
on the fact that his experience with the sea is pro-
bably limited to the rubber duck in his bathtub
and a three dollar box of salt water taffy from
Atlantic City.

I certainly hope that Mr. Shady’s column
didn’t wind up in the hands of Dennis Conner or
the San Diego Yacht Club. His days would be
numbered! In the future I would ask Mr. Shady
one favor before he writes his next column
fi off those damn sunglasses and see the
ight!

Lexington voters
may change laws

 

By MATHEW HORRIDGE
Staff Reporter

——

+ Lexington residents may be allow-
'

t ed to vote on a referendum repealing
F the city’s blue laws as early as June
if a bill that passed a Virginia Senate
F committee last week is signed by
Gov. Gerald Baliles.

The Senate Privileges and Elec-
tions Committee of the General
Assembly passed a bill that would
allow localities to hold referendums
to repeal the ..ue laws at any time if
the locality pays for the special elec-
tion.

The blue laws became an area
issue in December when the man-
ager of the Leggett’s store in the city
- complained to local authorities about
stores in the city and Rockbridge
County being opened on Sundays, in
defiance of the blue laws.

_ At the Jan. 8 Lexington City Coun-
cil. meeting, Frances Ruley and
several other Maxway Department
Store employees asked the council to
hold a special election in May to
repeal the laws that allow only the
sale of food and medicine and the
operation of service businesses, in-
cluding gas stations and towing
. trucks.

David Mertz, a former Maxway

manager, said at that meeting area

 

 

businesses would lose that $900,000 a
year because of Sunday closings.

State law currently allows referen-
dums to be placed on local ballots on-
ly during a general election on even-
numbered years. In that case, a blue
laws referendum could not be held in
Lexington until 1992.

Mrs. Ruley said she and several
other area merchants travelled to
Richmond last week to support the
bill introduced by Sen. Frank Nolen.
The bill now goes to the Senate floor
and then to the House of Delegates.

In order to place a referendum on
an election ballot, a petition contain-
ing 10 percent of a_ locality’s
registered voters must be submitted
to the local judge at least 60 days
prior to the election date. Mrs. Ruley
said she has collected many more
than the 650 names required for a
referendum to be placed on the Lex-
ington ballot.

Although Rockbridge County was
named in Leggett’s complaint about
blue law violators, there has not been
a drive to get signatures for a petition
in the county.

Mrs. Ruley said she would pro-
bably not submit a request for a
referendum until May to ensure she
has enough support for the measure
to pass. This would mean that an
election could not be held until July.

In 1980, Buena Vista residents ap-

proved a referendum repealing the
blue laws by 100 votes.

“(The city council) is willing to
have the election as soon as possi-
ble,’’ Mrs. Ruley said.

In the mean time, local merchants
have been asked to abide by the
codes. Violation of the blue law can
result in fines up to $1,000 and/or one
year in jail. Thus far, no arrests have
been reported in either the city or
Rockbridge County.

Lt. Bruce M. Beard, acting chief of
the Lexington Police Department,
said he hadn't heard anything about
the blue laws in his 17-year police
career until December. Beard said
periodic checks would be made at the
city’s stores to make sure merchants
are obeying the blue laws.

   

 

By Perry S. Hayes/The Ring-tum Phi

Maxway’s new manager, Barry
Guffery, said he was not allowed to
say exactly how much money the
store was losing because of Sunday
closings but he did say the figure ac-
counted for 15 percent of its weekly
earnings. In addition, he said, the
closings forced the store to lay off
four employees.

Mertz said onc of the inequities of
the blue law is that stores such as
Maxway and Rose’s must be closed
on Sundays but drugstores, like
Super X, can remain open and sell
many non-prescription items.

Mrs. Ruley said many store owners
in the area, including the owners of
the Ladies’ Habit, College Towne
Shoppe and Pink ‘n’ Blue, are in
favor of being open on Sundays.

 

Sally Mann is a tradition breaker

Like her photos, Sally Mann evokes
different images in different people.

To Lexingtonians she is the person
With the weird sculpture in her front
yard. To New Yorkers she is one of a
New breed of avant-grade photog-
Taphers. And to many others she is
the photographer with the big, old
Camera they have seen in many
Newspapers recently.

And Sally Mann is also a lot of
things to Sally Mann: photographer,
Mother and tradition breaker.

Mann recently had an exhibit in the

duPont Gallery at Washington
and Lee. The exhibit, titled ‘“‘Sweet
Silent Thought,” was a collection of
stark black-and-white. prints: of -12-
year-old girls.

1982 and 1986 in this area but were ex-

Of the many Supreme Court cases
Ynvolving the conflict between free

gas important as the case of Rich-

“e mond Newspapers Inc. v. Virginia.

Not only did the Richmond case
arantee the right of the public and

Hathe press to attend criminal trials,
Mbut it also helped unmuddy the

Me ters created by the Gannett v.
DePasquale decision of 1979.

>For these reasons, J. Stewart
i Bryan III, publisher of the Richmond
selimes-Dispatch and News Leader,
iwas presented the 1987 First Amend-
ment’ Award last week by the
Washington and Lee campus chapter

Bryan who led Richmond News-
papers, Inc. into this important court
battle. As SDX adviser Clark R.
Mollenhoff noted, Bryan’s efforts
was especially commendable be-
cause the Richmond papers had
nothing direct to gain from the case.

After receiving his award; Bryan
discussed the case with journalism
students, professors and other
members of the W&L community ina
30-minute lecture in duPon Audi-
torium.

In Gannett v. DePasquale, a divid-
ed court found that the press and
public had no Sixth Amendment right
to attend pretrial suppression hear-
ings closed by agreement of the pro-
secution and defense. But some
judges interpreted the decision to
mean that they could close trials, too,
and an estimated 270 closure motions
were made in the 12 months between
the Gannett and Richmond decisions.

 

 

 

 

Rhona Hughes

Butler said the Board was impress-
ed with her interview because ‘“‘she
handled herself well and came up
with all of the things we thought
needed to be done.’ Hughes’ ex-
perience from working on the staff
selling ads also helped her “‘to know
what needed to be done and how to do
it,’’ said Butler.

Hughes’ responsibilities will in-
clude billing, selling ads and paying
the printing costs, She is also now a
member of the Publications Board.
She will also be responsible for the
management of the Phi’s finances
and budget. If the Phi ‘‘continues the
way it is going now, everything (the
budget) will be fine,’’ commented
John Pensec, the Phi’s News Editor.

 

The Richmond case was decided
exactly a year after the Gannett deci-
sion. Bryan said that although hiring
lawyers for such a case was expen-
sive, he thought he had an obligation
to take the case to court.

As Bryan explained, reporters for
the Times-Dispatch and News
Leader were covering a murder
retrial in Hanover County Circuit
Court. The accused earlier had been
convicted in that court, but the
Virginia Supreme Court reversed the
conviction, ruling that inadmissible
evidence had been introduced. The
case already had been retried twice,
both times ending in mistrials.

Before the start of the fourth trial,
the defense counsel requested that

’ the trial be closed. The prosecution

had no objections.

But the two newspaper reporters
did. After the judge refused to reopen
the trial, they appealed the case to

Ruscio to

the Virginia Supreme Court, which
turned them down. But the U.S.
Supreme Court did agree to hear the
case. Writing for the majority, Chief
Justice Warren Burger found that
“absent an overriding interest ar-
ticulated in findings, the trial of a
criminal case must be open to the
public.”

This means that.the public and
press do have the right to attend
criminal trials under the First and
Fourteenth Amendments unless all
other alternatives guaranteeing a
fair trial have been tested and found
unsatisfactory. These alternatives
include moving the trial, bringing in
an outside jury, holding the trial at a
later date and sequestering the jury.

Only Justice William Rehnquist,
now the chief justice, dissented.
Justice Lewis F. Powell, a W&L
graduate, did not participate in the
Richmond decision.

He has served as an associate
faculty member in the depdepart-

Ruscio was a graduate research
assistant and assistant to the director
of the M.P.A. program at Syracuse
from 1978 to 1981. He was a doctoral
research fellow in the U.S. General
Accounting Office from 1981 to 1982.

Grant awarded

to Beckley

 

From Staff Reports

 

Harlan R. Beckley, associate pro-
fessor of religion at Washington and
Lee, has been awarded a National
Endowment for the Humanities Fel-
lowship for College Teachers and In-
dependent Scholars.

Beckley is the second W&L pro-
fessor in two years to receive the
prestigious research grant. Edwin D.
Craun, professor of English, was
awarded a grant for the current
academic year.

The NEH grants support indepen-
dent study projects in the human-
ities. Beckley will conduct his
research on “‘Justice in the Thought
of Walter Rauschenbusch, John A.
Ryan and Reinhold Niebuhr,” during
the 1987-88 academic year, when he
plans to be on sabbatical leave.

“These three stand apart from
other Christian ethicists in the first
half of the 20th century for their in-
fluence upon Christian thought and
practice and for their impace upon
public policy in the United States,”
Beckley said. He plans to publish a
book on the topic.

Beckley has been studying the
theories of justice of the three
theologians, drawing from their
writings and studies of their
thoughts, lives and times. Beckley
will ‘‘trace the development and ap-
plication of theologians’ theories of

justice in the context of the intellec-
tual and political movements of the
time to which the men were respon-
ding.”

Beckley’s project will build on
previous studies and essays on
religious ethics and justice, including
a recent two-part article, ‘A Chris-
tian Affirmation of John Rawls’s
Idea of Justice as Fairness,’’ which
was published in “The Journal of
Religious Ethics’’ in the fall of 1985
and the fall of 1986.

Prior to joining the Washington
and Lee faculty in 1974, Beckley serv-
ed as pastor of the Kingston Springs
United Methodist Charge, where he
served three churches in Kingston
Springs, Tenn. He received his B.S.
degree from the Unitersity of Illinois,
his M. Div. from Vanderbilt Divinity
School, and his M.A. and Ph.D.
degrees from Vanderbilt University.

Beckley was awarded an Andrew
W. Mellon Foundation Grant and was
a Research Fellow in 1981-82 for Ad-
vanced Study of Religion at the
University of Chicago. He has receiv-
ed numerous Glenn Grants from
Washington and Lee for summer
research.

While Beckley is on sabbatical next
year, Neville Richardson of the
University of Natal in Pietermaritz-

burg, South Africa, will teach
courses on theology and ethics and
South African religion.

Pest scam is

 

From The Associated Press

 

The 71-year-old head of a family
that ran a fraudulent pest exter-
minator scheme along the East Coast
for 30 years was sentenced to five
years in prison.

The sentence Monday was the sec-
ond conviction in Virginia for Robert

Matthew Bales of Wilburn, Fla., who.
was sentenced to 14 years in prison in..

Staunton on similar convictions last
year and faces other charges in Bath
County. Monday’s sentence will run
consecutively with any other
said‘. Circuit

Judge George E. Honts III.. Bales -

pleaded guilty in December to 35
charges of obtaining money by false
pretenses.

Testimony in December showed
Bales’ crew planted insects in the
homes of elderly people during free
inspections, then charged large fees
to rid the house of insects. Bales was
ordered to pay his Rockbridge Coun-
ty customers $14,603 in restitution.

“*You preyed on the aged, the weak
and the vulnerable,”’ the judge told
Bales. Because Bales is old, he

+ j/uncovered
“

should have been more sympathetic
to his victims, Honts said.

Bales, whose son and grandsons
also have been convicted of exter-
mination fraud here and in other
Virginia localities, testified Monday
that he brought his business to
Virginia in 1985 after being charged
with similar offenses in Florida.

His grandson, James M. ‘‘Mickey”’
.Quattlebaum Jr., who has testified
-for.,: prosecutors ip hundreds .of
charges against Bales and Quat-

tlebaum’s father, brothers and co- |

workers, said in interviews last year |
that he and other crew members |
sometimes charged old people}

thousands of dollars for unwarranted

_ and poorly executed work.

Quattlebaum, convicted with the
others, estimated that the group
made between $350,000 and $400,000
in Virginia in 1985. Police estimate |
over 600 people in about 13 Virginia |
counties were victimized.

Quattlebaum said the family had|
been operating the scam for about 30
years in the Southeast. |

INTENTIONAL SECOND EXPOSURE

The Ring-tum Phi, February 12, 1987

 

Reasoning

Judging from the way he views the state of Washington and
Lee, it is obvious that Dr. Wilson views the University solely
from his office in Washington Hall, an office with rose-

_ colored windows.

Wilson is entitled to his views, but one wonders how he for-
“*" mulates them. Rarely, these days, is the president seen walk-
ing around campus having informal chats with students to
discover what their opinions of his administration are. Many

_ students have valid criticisms of the way Washington and

“» _ The size of the student body is approaching what it was in

“1970s would mean the University would, once again, be all

The class of 1991 will have 420 students in it. If the class size

‘Platoon’: just another Vietnam
movie? Or something else...?

 

MY VIEW
By Paul J. Smith

When it was over, I could not move.
My body was drained of all energy,
shaken to its depths. I could do
nothing but stare, stare at a screen of
names, of tributes, to people who had
contributed to this monumental ef-
fort to heal America of her wounds.

On the surface, it was a rather sim-

“Ig Platoon realistic?” I hear it
asked everywhere. But how can

someone in my generation know? We
never served in Vietnam. We are the
children of Vietnam, of a national
tragedy. Hazy to our minds are the
countless images of young men being
slaughtered in a horrendously hot
and humid tropical climate. Some-
what more clear are the memories of
the anti-war movement, protest mar-
ches held by university students who

Let’s get some things straight.

Single-sex education is not sexist. It does not
promote a “‘separate-but-equal” standard as if
girls were seoond-rate citizens.

Coeducation hasn’t enlightened the W&L man.
Instead it has brought sexism to Lexington and
embittered him.

Efforts to make girls feel at home, and that
they “‘improve’’ the school are insulting. The im-
plication ir that we were selfish, or the old W&L
had no place in the 20th century.

Coeducation’s opponents are not misogynists,
closet homos, mama’s boys or chauvinists afraid
of women. To dismiss arguments forsingle-sex
education as fulminations by frustrated semi-
perverts and reactionaries misses the mark.

But that is now the standard response to any
efforts to intelligent discussion. This type of
name-calling would not have happened at the old
Wet. Con you blame us for missing that institu-
tion?

“Washington and Lee enjoys freedom from
outside control. The university is free to chart its
own course, consistent with the highest educa-

Lexington voters
may change laws

 

By MATHEW HORRIDGE
Staff Reporter

Lexington residents may be allow-
ed to vote on a referendum repealing
the city’s blue laws as early as June
if a bill that passed a Virginia Senate
committee last week is signed by
‘Gov. Gerald Baliles.

The Senate Privileges and Elec-
‘tions Committee of the General
Assembly passed a bill that would
‘allow localities to hold referendums
to repeal the ..ue laws at any time if
"the locality pays for the special elec-
tion.

* The blue laws became an area

Like her photos, Sally Mann evokes
different images in different people.

To Lexingtonians she is the person
with the weird sculpture in her front

New breed of avant-grade photog-
Taphers. And to many others she is
the photographer with the big, old
Camera they have seen in many
Newspapers recently.

And Sally Mann is also a lot of
things to Sally Mann: photographer,

State law currently allows referen-
dums to be placed on local ballots on-
ly during a general election on even-
numbered years. In that case, a blue
laws referendum could not be held in
Lexington until 1992.

Mrs. Ruley said she and several
other area merchants travelled to
Richmond last week to support the
bill introduced by Sen. Frank Nolen.
The bill now goes to the Senate floor
and then to the House of Delegates.

In order to place a referendum on
an election ballot, a petition contain-
ing 10 percent of a_ locality’s
registered voters must be submitted
to the local judge at least 60 days
prior to the election date. Mrs. Ruley
said she has collected many more
than the 650 names required for a
referendum to be placed on the Lex-
ington ballot.

Although Rockbridge County was
named in Leggett’s complaint about
blue law violators, there has not been
a drive to get signatures for a petition
in the county.

Mrs. Ruley said she would pro-
bably not submit a request for a
referendum until May to ensure she
has enough support for the measure
to pass. This would mean that an
election could not be held until July.

In Gannett v. DePasquale, a divid-

to attend pretrial suppression hear-

ings closed by agreement of the pro- °

judges interpreted the decision to
mean that they could close trials, too,
and an estimated 270 closure motions
were made in the 12 months between
the Gannett and Richmond decisions.

She will also be responsible for the

“(The city council) is willing to
have the election as soon as possi-

In the mean time, local merchants
have been asked to abide by the
codes. Violation of the blue law can
result in fines up to $1,000 and/or one
year in jail. Thus far, no arrests have
been reported in either the city or
Rockbridge County.

Lt. Bruce M. Beard, acting chief of
the Lexington Police Department,
said he hadn't heard anything about
the blue laws in his 17-year police
career until December. Beard said
periodic checks would be made at the
city’s stores to make sure merchants

Maxway’s new manager, Barry
Guffery, said he was not allowed to
say exactly how much money the
store was losing because of Sunday
closings but he did say the figure ac-
counted for 15 percent of its weekly
earnings. In addition, he said, the
closings forced the store to lay off
four employees.

Mertz said onc of the inequities of
the blue law is that stores such as
Maxway and Rose’s must be closed
on Sundays but drugstores, like
Super X, can remain open and sell
many non-prescription items.

Mrs. Ruley said many store owners
in the area, including the owners of
the Ladies’ Habit, College Towne
Shoppe and Pink ‘n’ Blue, are in
favor of being open on Sundays.

 

The Richmond case was decided
exactly a year after the Gannett deci-
sion. Bryan said that although hiring
lawyers for such a case was expen-
sive, he thought he had an obligation
to take the case to court.

both times ending in mistrials.

Sorry, bud due to the Grant awarded

Curforce men} of the Blue Laws |

to Beckley

 

From Staff Reports

 

Harlan R. Beckley, associate pro-
fessor of religion at Washington and
Lee, has been awarded a National
Endowment for the Humanities Fel-
lowship for College Teachers and In-
dependent Scholars.

Beckley is the second W&L pro-
fessor in two years to receive the
prestigious research grant. Edwin D.
Craun, professor of English, was
awarded a grant for the current
academic year.

The NEH grants support indepen-
dent study projects in the human-
ities. Beckley will conduct his
research on ‘‘Justice in the Thought
of Walter Rauschenbusch, John A.
Ryan and Reinhold Niebuhr,’’ during
the 1987-88 academic year, when he
plans to be on sabbatical leave.

“These three stand apart from
other Christian ethicists in the first
half of the 20th century for their in-
fluence upon Christian thought and
practice and for their impace upon
public policy in the United States,”
Beckley said. He plans to publish a
book on the topic.

Beckley has been studying the
theories of justice of the three
theologians, drawing from their
writings and studies of their
thoughts, lives and times. Beckley
will “trace the development and ap-
plication of theologians’ theories of

justice in the context of the intellec-
tual and political movements of the
time to which the men were respon-
ding.”

Beckley’s project will build on
previous studies and essays on
religious ethics and justice, including
a recent two-part article, ‘‘A Chris-
tian Affirmation of John Rawls’s
Idea of Justice as Fairness,’’ which
was published in ‘“‘The Journal of
Religious Ethics” in the fall of 1985
and the fall of 1986.

Prior to joining the Washington
and Lee faculty in 1974, Beckley serv-
ed as pastor of the Kingston Springs
United Methodist Charge, where he
served three churches in Kingston
Springs, Tenn. He received his B.S.
degree from the Unitersity of Illinois,
his M. Div. from Vanderbilt Divinity
School, and his M.A. and Ph.D.
degrees from Vanderbilt University.

Beckley was awarded an Andrew
W. Mellon Foundation Grant and was
a Research Fellow in 1981-82 for Ad-
vanced Study of Religion at the
University of Chicago. He has receiv-
ed numerous Glenn Grants from
Washington and Lee for summer
research.

While Beckley is on sabbatical next
year, Neville Richardson of the
University of Natal in Pietermaritz-
burg, South Africa, will teach
courses on theology and ethics and
South African religion.

By BECKY REYNOLDS
Staff Reporter

There is a celebration going on in
Reid Hall this year. 1987 is the twen-

tieth year anniversary of WLUR, the
Washington and Lee campus radio
station. Found at 91.5 on the FM
radio dial, WLUR has grown and
developed throughout its twenty year
existence.

On November 1, 1966, the Federal
Communications Commission grant-
ed Washington and Lee a construc-
tion permit for a new Class D, non-
commercial, educational FM broad-
casting station of ten watts power.
This permit opened the door to begin
WLUR. An area on the third floor of
Reid Hall was designated as the site
of the new radio station and a thirty
foot antenna was assembled on the
roof. The broadcasting studio was
equipped with a type FM-22 transmit:
ter. WDBJ, Roanoke, Virginia do-
nated a Western Electric control

board, three turntables, five tape’

recorders and various other equip-
ment to the WLUR’ project. :
automatic cartridge tape playback, a
variety of tape cartridges, micro-
phones, an AM/FM tuner and four
thousand LP recordings were also
obtained for the station: And, along
with the broadcasting station, tape
and record libraries and a news room
complete with Associated Press
wires were set up in Reid Hall for use
by radio personnel.

When WLUR began, the station
manager was Charles E. Winston
and the Chief Engineer was J. Ed
Newman. On Tuesday, January 3ist,
Newman ran a series of equipment
tests with the new WLUR facilities.

_ The station operated smoothly within

plus or minus twenty thousand cycles
to its assigned frequency of 91.5

. Megacycles.

After taking a survey of the cam-

pus and Lexington, the officers of
‘ WLUR discovered that the most

wanted program was a classical

: music show followed by Broadway

and movie scores and news pro-
grams respectively. With this infor- -

. mation in mind, WLUR-FM began its

regular schedule of ‘broadcasts on
February 25, 1967..:The - station’s
hours of operation were 7:00 to 11:00
p.m., Monday through Friday.

Fred C. Cole, President of Wash-
ington and Lee University when
WLUR began, said of the station: :

John K. Jennings, ’56, professor of
Journalism today, returned to

An™ : Washington and Lee after graduate

school a year after WLUR started
operating. He remembers the station
as much smaller with less broad-
casting time but still well supported
by the University and community.

In 1977, Robert deMaria was hired
to work on WLUR and is still the
General Manager and Journalism
Department representative . of
WLUR. When he arrived at W&L,
deMaria found the station somewhat
chaotic. In previous years, there had
been numerous General: Managers
who were not consistent. However,
deMaria has been a member of the
WLUR community for nine years,
and he is in charge of the biggest
staff ever to work on the radio sta-

_, tion.

Since deMaria’ s arrival at WLUR,

the station has acquired almost all

new equipment including a compact
disk player two years ago. Although

». the. station is in need of a: new
‘transmitter,-a twenty-five thousand

dollar “project, deMaria feel that
WLUR has ‘“‘state_of the art equip-
ment.” The station has grown and
prospered. » For. example, - in 1977,
WLUR™ had three: hundred — jazz
albums; now there are over four
thousand LP’s in the jazz collection.

students to add the late-night ‘Third

. over the reigns to another professor,

Jeryl Davis, who was replaced by de
Maria in 1977.
De Maria said the station was very

unorganized when he came on board. -

He improved the schedule, which
consisted of blocks of jazz, classics,
rock, news and public ’ affairs
programming at specific times dur-.
ing the day.

“Tt still serves mainly as an educa-
tional outlet,” he said.

Today, about 30 percent of the
programming is classics. Another 30
percent is rock; and another 30 per-

The most popular music programs
on WLUR include Classical Show-
case, Third Ear, Afternoon Rock,
Oldies and Skyline Jazz. The music
that is played on WLUR is closely
monitored and carefully screened.
The staff of WLUR is in contact with
record companies that deMaria
thinks ‘‘will be supportive as long as
we play their music, keep in touch
and let them know what we are do-
ing.” WLUR follows a playlist from
‘College Media Journal”’ and at least
half of all shows contain new music.

Another growing part of WLUR is
its new department. Although most
news is obtained from the Associated
Press, this is the first year that on-
the-spot radio reporting has been
successful. Monday through Friday,
a different story is reported on by a
Washington and Lee student. This
project works in correlation with the
Journalism Department ‘and the
reporters earn one credit each.

on the Gong Show at the age of 10 by
impersonating a dead president. As a

Sail has shown that people in

Students are in class at those times

Late afternoon is an excellent time
for rock because it attracts both col-
lege and high school students, be
said. The station is run by W&L, but
it is licensed to serve Lexington and
Rockbridge County. So the program-
ming must serve more than just the
W&L students.

The evening music schedule begins
with classics, followed by pro-

the eclectic Third Ear from midnight

hibit closely parallels Mann’s rela-
Yionship with Lexington.

* Mann was born in Lexington to the
gity’s most well-known doctor, :
Robert S. Munger, 34 years ago. At
‘15, she went to a prep school in Ver-
mont where she began her photog-
raphy career with a $50 portrait job
‘of her roommate, the daughter of Ali
Shah Khan and Rita Hayworth.

She went from a Vermont prep
‘school to Vermon’t Bennington Col-
Jlege, a woman’s school that further
stimulated her interest in the arts.

* “T couldn’t have gone to any school
swith rigid policies,” Mann said in an
interview at her home. She said she
‘took as many photography and writ-
ing courses as she could and ignored
the other disciplines.

’ “T am a functional fool in terms of
mot having taken history and chem-
istry,’’ she said.

‘ Besides photography, Mann found
another subject she was interested
in: her future husband Larry Mann,
‘who is now a lawyer and city coun-
scilman in Lexington.

Mann left Bennington after getting
‘married in 1970 and traveled exten-
sively in Europe, studying photog-
raphy and writing intermittently.

* After returning to Lexington,
where Larry set up a blacksmith
shop in their house on McLaughlin
‘Street, Mann received her under-
«graduate and master’s degrees from
Hollins College.

Why did Sally return home to Lex-
<ngton after being a world-traveler?

“T think there’s genuine concern
‘for people here,” she said. Her ex-
hibits in Lexington have drawn a
jarge number of area people, she
‘said, because the local people are in-
terested in what others in the com-
munity are doing.

Many probably wondered what
Mann was doing when she wrapped

ment of 1,742. In 1
ment of 1,758.

Next year’s freshman class size of
420 will be 16 more than in 1978.

“In freshman housing, there were
some miscalculations the first year,”’
Wilson admits, though with the new
Gaines Hall taking on first-year law
students, he says Baker dorm will be
opened fully to freshmen.

“Dean John thinks we can house
420 Freshman adequately,” Wilson

an enroli-

‘said.

 

 

And what about Gaines Hall? Is
this part of the big attempt to kill
fraternities?

“IT am not against fraternities,”
Wilson said. “I was a member of a
fraternity in college.”’

“Washington and Lee has had one
of the longest commitments to frater-

foil and put odd sculpture in her front

yard.

She has said that Lexington is a
fairly tolerant community but admits
many people are ‘‘easily shocked.”

“T tako my role as local iconoclast
quite seriously,”’ she said. “I think
it’s good for Lexington.”

“Complacency and contrived gen-
tility really irk me.”

Her work, the essence of Sally
Mann, may be contrived somewhat
but it is certainly not complacent
because photography, she said, must
be active.

“Art should be something that
makes you feel,” she said, and
photography in particular should
seek truth.

“Even if it’s a contrived picture,
I’m still trying for the truth.”

The truth she seeks in her photos
now is a long way from the truth she
recorded as a photographer for the
Washington and Lee news office in
the early 1970s. Maybe the difference
lies in the camera she used then and
the one she uses now.

In an interview with the Roanoke
Times and World-News three years
ago, Mann said working with her 100-
year-old view-finder camera did not
fit her spontaneous character.

Last week, however, she said the
large-format camera does comple-
ment her temperament.

“I’m plodding, methodical,’”’ she
said, characteristics necessary for
working with a camera that does not
have the high shutter speed of a
35mm camera.

For her recent exhibit, Mann said
she often shot the subjects several
times to make sure the girl was com-
fortable with the photo and Mann was
satisfied with the image.

One quality that Mann said makes
a good picture, ‘detention of par-
ticulars,”’ is expressed particularly
well with the big camera because
prints made from the camera’s large
negatives usually are not enlarged.
Smaller negatives are enlarged and
the process tends to make lines and
small objects fuzzy as the print size
increases

A good Sally Mann photo, she said,

“Washington and Lee has had

nities in the land. We depend on
fraternities for social activities, as
well as housing and food,”’ Wilson
said.

“What we need to do here is em-
phasize the fraternity houses
themselves...emphasize friends in
small groups having fun.”’

“We need to get the houses behind
a more varied set of activities, not
just social activities.”

Fixing up the houses, and not hav-
ing parties that damage the property
are ways to do this, he said.

“We cannot afford to have 17
destroyed houses in town...also,
fraternities are starting to realize
their liabilities.”’

“Fraternity life at W&L used to
have a certain elegance...I’m sure
they knew how to party in the 50s, but
the fraternity houses were pleasant
places to live in then.”

“We want to see the fraternities
develop a distinctive social style
again,” said Wilson. ‘Not a six-keg

is “‘the combination of strange and
ing elements which, in a good
picture, for a sense of harmony.”’
Some people who saw the ex-
hibit in the duPont Gallery apparent-
ly thought there were too many
strange and jarring elements in her
photos. Some of the comments in the
exhibit’s registration book said the
work was offensive and ugly.

“T don’t like having to defend my
art,” Mann said. She said many of
the negative comments had come
from Washington and Lee students
and she believes their dislike of the
pictures may stem from not under-
standing the subjects, girls who are
predominantly from poor families.

“(The students) don’t know many

~ women like that.”

Mann said Washington and Lee is
not the only place where her work
has been questioned.

“I think my critics run the gamut,”
she said.

Sally Mann does not have thin skin,
however. She said that bad com-
ments, though not ego boosters, are
more comforting than blank com-
‘ment hooks...

“A jblank space makes me
wonder,”’ she said. “I think they’re
good pictures so I’m not worried.”

And worried she should not be
because her work has found a niche
in the inner circle of the art world.

The Polaroid Co. gave her thous-
ands of dollars worth of film and a
large-format Polaroid camera to
photograph different items she tosses
in a small wading pool she keeps in
her backyard.

The images of suspended, decom-
posed and odd objects are colorful
and mysterious.

She was one of a few photographers
in the country chosen for this project

Mann has also found a niche,
perhaps smaller than the one she oc-
cupies in photography, in the literary
circle. She said a book of her poems
will be published later this year.

‘Schroeder on women

SON PEN

News Editor

" Surprise! Women didn’t come to
‘America on cruise ships. And they
didn’t ask where they could get their
nails done as soon as they set foot on
‘dry land.

A woman, however, was responsi-
ble for the printing of the Declaration
of In . And a woman was
the only Revolutionary War soldier
buried at West Point. And Martha
‘Washington, wife of George, was
compensated by Congress for war-
time service. George said her
presence at Valley Forge inspired
the soldiers.

But many women don’t know about
‘what women have done in history, ac-
‘cording to Congresswoman Patricia
Schroeder (D-Colo), and neither do
men.

* Schroeder said that while many
wwomen are struggling to juggle
careers and families, they don’t
Tealize that it has been done before.
Martha Washington, for example,
yan Mount Vernon from planting to
harvest each year and then went to
join her husband.

, Women still think they are lesser
beings is they are not able to manage
oth a career and a family, said
Schroeder. And according to Labor
Department statistics, 9-out-of-10

point in their lives. Very few women,
she said, have the option of choosing
between a career and raising a fami-

an endowed lecture series in honor of
one of the first suffragettes.

The whole point of the series, said
Schroeder, is to show what women
have done, They are not asking to
walk behind men, nor in front of
them, but rather walk by their sides,
she said. ‘They are not asking for
more, they are asking for equal.”

Schroeder was first elected to Con-
gress in 1972. She is the dean of the
Colorado delegation, the most senior
woman in Congress and is the Demo-
cratic whip. She said she knows first-
hand what it is like to try and balance
acareer and a family. However, ‘‘We
are not superwomen,”’ she said.

In talking about the American
family, Schroeder, the founder of the
Congressional Caucus on Women’s
Issues, said that there is no option,
we must do something about the

American family. One of the first
places to start, she said, is to stop
thinking of it as male versus female,
and start thinking of it as family.

The divorce rate in the United
States is one of the highest in the
western world, and the lowest paid
workers are day-care workers and
teachers.

“What are we saying about our
young people?”’ she asked.

Schroeder is co-sponsor of a bill
that would allow general wage
earners six moths leave without pay
if taken sick and four months leave
without pay if they have or adopt a
child. These are compromises, but
Schroeder admitted they were better
than nothing.

The United States is not the first
country to adopt a. policy like this,
said Schroeder. It is the last.

party were the local high-school kids
wander in.”

“We need to get a generation in
here that doesn’t remember being
legal to drink.”

Wilson thinks all the fraternity
houses can survive.

When the guidelines for co-ed
enrollment were set in 1984, he said,
1,000 men were thought to be enough
to keep the fraternity system going.

In 1984, the last year before co-ed,
824 men out of 1,300 were frat
members, or about 60 percent.

If fraternities could be made more
appealing, it was reasoned, more
men would join. If 80 percent of 1,000
men pledged, the frats would still
have their 800 men.

Over 80 percent of this year’s
freshman class did pledge this year,
but the members were not spread out
evenly between the houses.

The future, Wilson said, will show
whether each house can get its share
of the 80 percent.

Sampson is to appeal

 

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Assignments Editor

Phillip L. Sampson Jr., the
freshman who was suspended by the
Student Conduct Committee last
week for shooting a 15-year-old girl
with a blowdart, said Tuesday he
would appeal the decision.

Sampson’s appeal was scheduled
to be considered today by the Student
Affairs Committee, according to
Dean of Students Lewis G. John,
chairman of the 10-member SAC.
That committee has the options of
upholding the SCC’s decision or
reducing the penalty, John said. It
cannot vote for a harsher penalty.

On Jan. 29, Sampson was placed on
social probation and conduct proba-
tion by the 13-student SCC. The SAC
reviewed the case and asked the SCC
to reconsider its findings.

The SCC then voted to suspend
Sampson, a freshman from H
for shooting the girl in the s
with the dart.

The Ring-tum Phi, February 12, 1987, Page 5

gro in enrollment, Wilson
thinks, does not effect W&L’s status
as a teaching institution.

“Our faculty-student ratio is
higher now than it was four years
ago...teaching is still the primary
obligation of the faculty.”

More money is being allocated to
encourage professors to do research
over the summer, but these ‘‘profes-
sional activities’ will not interfere
with teaching he said.

“This is a teaching institution from
September to June...(though) it is
important that faculty stay in touch
with their peers; we are small and
isolated.”

“Faculty members still teach
three courses each, so they can ask
for writing and have personal rela-
tionships with students,”’ he said.

According to Wilson, class sizes
have not increased substantially.

“We looked at class size...the
number of classes with under 30
students has stayed the same. There
are 11 classes with over 40 students.”’

These larger classes, he said, are
mostly with the more popular pro-
fessors, particularly in the history
department, which had three mem-
bers on leave last term.

Overall, he said, W&L can main-
tain its small class sizes.

The president hears all the
criticism leveled at ‘‘the administra-
tion” but, to his way of thinking, this
is just part of the transition.

“‘T have to try desperately to keep
perspective, and that’s dreadfully
hard to do...I have to keep telling
myself to slow down, don’t overad-
ministrate.”’

“‘We reconsidered the case and felt
a mistake had been made in a few dif-
ferent areas, and therefore changed
our decision,’’ SCC Chairman
Michael R. McAllister said in an in-
terview this week. ‘‘The Student Con-
duct Committee is content with the
decision.”

John said that the SAC agreed with
the SCC’s finding that Sampson was
guilty of a major offense under
university rules because he inflicted
bodily injury. The only two penalties
that may be given for such an offense
are suspension and expulsion, unless
the case involves ‘‘unusual extenua-
tion.”

John said the SAC could not find
any extenuating circumstances. It
did not ask for a specific penalty,
John said, only that the initial penal-
ty be reconsidered.

In a separate incident, Bernard

with statutory burglary, petit

Sampson told the Phi three weeks
ago that he did not shoot Atkins’
daughter on purpose, that he had not
meant to hit anyone with the dart and
that he didn’t find out that the girl
had been hit until the next day.

The incident occurred after the
W&L-Roanoke basketball game on
Jan. 15. Sampson said he shot the
dart from a second-floor window of
the Graham-Lees dorm toward some
Roanoke fans who were making
degrading comments to incite the
W&L students. He estimated that the
Roanokers were between 50 and 75
yards away.

Sampson said he knew he could not
shoot the dart that far but thought
that it might intimidate them.

University Proctor Charles F.
“Murph” Murray said the dart was
at least four inches long, It hit the girl
in the back of the shoulder, Atkins
said, penetrating about a half-inch in-
to her skin.

Kreps calls for involvement

 

By JEFF HARWOOD
Staff Reporter

Juanita Kreps, the first woman and
the first economist to serve as United
States Secretary of Commerce, call-
ed on the United States to become
more involved in international trade
Tuesday night.

Speaking in Lee Chapel, Kreps said
that “economists always give a
gloomy message’”’ and that “we all
share a common interest: our
careers.

“Careers are linked, directly or in-
directly, with business affairs and
performance of economy,” she said.

Kreps, commerce secretary for
President Jimmy Carter from
1977-1979, said the imbalance of inter-
national trade has caused the United
States to “feel a greater economic
vulnerability.” Future economic
development in the United States
must involve the international
market.

And she warned that American in-
dustries are expected to face more
difficulties in the future. Citing
various facts and statistics, Kreps

described “Japan as the greatest
saver and the United States as the
greatest borrower.”

The mixture of ‘Anglo-Saxon
hedonism and Oriental thrift’? has
caused economic conflict which, con-
trary to some American theories, is
not caused solely by the high value of
the U.S. dollar, according to Kreps.
In response to the United States’ re-
quest that other countries stimulate
their economies, nations such as Ger-
many have said it is the responsibili-
ty of the United States.

“Should the United States en-
courage the thrifty Japaneses and
other investors around the world to
acquire U.S. debts and private pro-
perty,”’ Kreps asked, ‘‘or should we
involve domestic policies that would
discourage conumption and en-
courage greater savings?”’

If it is the latter, she said, ‘“The ’86
tax reform moved us in the wrong
direction.”

Many U.S. companies are moving
to Japan and other countries in the
Pacific where they will have room to
develop more efficiently, Kreps said.
The U.S. ‘‘adjustment has not been
smooth, nor complete.

“We must invest in human re-
sources,’’ she said.

She suggested that instead of pro-
tecting our industries that sell higher
priced goods, the American public
should be willing to raise the educa-
tion and skill level of the workers
whose jobs are jeopardized by
foreign industries.

In an attempt to lessen interna-
tional trade conflicts, the United
States and Japan have established
economic pledges. Kreps said the
United States requested a ‘‘reduction
in Japan’s discount rate and a
budgetary proposal designed to
stimulate the Japanese economy. In
return, the United States pledged its
opposition to protectionist measures
and promised significant and steady
reductions in the federal deficit.”

When confronted about the
economic policies of the Carter ad-
ministration, Kreps instead noted the
deficit increase and the current inter-
national trade imbalance of the
Reagan administration.

“You have to balance them,’’ she
said, ‘““You make your decision, I'll
make mine.”

Point cards cause jump in sales

By GEORGE G. SPARACIO
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee Snack
Bar has been experiencing over-
crowding this year due to the use of
point cards, which have been at-
tributed to an increase in sales of
over 50 percent.

Overcrowding at the snack bar has
been of concern to the Food Service
and to some students. To deal with
this, the snack bar opens two
registers at crowded times.

Junior Karl Brewer said, ‘‘It really
doesn’t bother me that much. You
know it’s going to be crowded five
minutes before class. If that bothers
you go at a different time.”’ Soph-
omore Gregory Castonuovo explain-
ed, “It’s hard to get a quick bite or
drink between classes.”

About five years ago, Gerald J.
Darrell, Director of University Food
Services, introduced the point card to

Washington and Lee as a conven-
ience to the students. Prior to this,
the only alternative was the 20-meal
plan.

Last year, Darrell introduced the
use of the point card in GHQ. In addi-
tion, students on the 20-meal plan
were permitted to eat in the GHQ as
an alternative. However, there was
not enough room to accommodate the
20-meal plan, so it was discontinued
in the GHQ.

Students came to Darrell last year
requesting that he devise a plan
allowing students to use their point
cards at the snack bar. Darrell said
that the purpose of the Food Service
is “to provide a service to the
students.” He went on to say that the
use of the point card at the snack bar
benefits all students.

Sales at the snack bar have dou-
bled this year. Richard L. Arm-
strong, Snack Bar Manager, said,
“The point card created a very

substantial increase in business.”
Armstrong said that last year, the
snack bar had only two days in which
sales went over $1,000. This year,
they are averaging over $1,400 a day,
and only twice have they dipped
below the $1,000 mark. Junior John
Packett said, ‘‘I think it’s great for a
bite to eat and a place to hang.”

In addition, Armstrong explained
that the point card produces substan-
tial savings. There is no tax on items
purchased with the card, giving the
student a seven percent discount.
Also there are specials in both the
GHQ and the snack bar providing
students with an additional 15 to 20
percent discount. Darrell also said
that over 80 percent of the students
charge their point card home.

In the future, there are plans for a
Bookstore/Snack Bar renovation.
Darrell said, ‘‘It’s going to be a big
project and we're really excited
about it.”’

WLUR celebrates its

By BECKY REYNOLDS
Staff Reporter

There is a celebration going on in
Reid Hall this year. 1987 is the twen-
tieth year anniversary of WLUR, the
Washington and Lee campus radio
station. Found at 91.5 on the FM
radio dial, WLUR has grown and
developed throughout its twenty year
existence.

On November 1, 1966, the Federal
Communications Commission grant-
ed Washington and Lee a construc-
tion permit for a new Class D, non-
commercial, educational FM broad-
casting station of ten watts power.
This permit opened the door to begin
WLUR. An area on the third floor of
Reid Hall was designated as the site
of the new radio station and a thirty
foot antenna was assembled on the
roof. The broadcasting studio was
equipped with a type FM-22 transmit-
ter. WDBJ, Roanoke, Virginia do-
nated a Western Electric control

board, three turntables, five tape’

recorders and various other equip-
ment to the WLUR project.~ An’
automatic cartridge tape playback, a
variety of tape cartridges, micro-
phones, an AM/FM tuner and four
thousand LP recordings were also
obtained for the station. And, along
with the broadcasting station, tape
and record libraries and a news room
complete with Associated Press
wires were set up in Reid Hall for use
by radio personnel.

When WLUR began, the station
manager was Charles E. Winston
and the Chief Engineer was J. Ed
Newman. On Tuesday, January 3ist,
Newman ran a series of equipment
tests with the new WLUR facilities.
The station operated smoothly within
plus or minus twenty thousand cycles
to its assigned frequency of 91.5

megacycles.

After taking a survey of the cam-

pus and Lexington, the officers of

WLUR discovered that the most
wanted program was a classical

. Music show followed by Broadway

and movie scores and news pro-
grams respectively. With this infor-
mation in mind, WLUR-FM began its
regular schedule of broadcasts on
February 25, 1967. The. station’s

' hours of operation were 7:00 to 11:00

p.m., Monday through Friday.

Fred C, Cole, President of Wash-
ington and Lee University when
WLUR began, said of the station:
“This [WLUR] is a service to the

whole community, to increase the

 

Robert deMaria

understanding and enjoyment of all
within the station’s range.”

John K. Jennings, '56, professor of
Journalism today, returned to
Washington and Lee after graduate
school a year after WLUR started
operating. He remembers the station
as much smaller with less broad-
casting time but still well supported
by the University and community.

In 1977, Robert deMaria was hired
to work on WLUR and is still the
General Manager and Journalism
Department representative . of
WLUR. When he arrived at W&L,
deMaria found the station somewhat
chaotic. In previous years, there had
been numerous General Managers
who were not consistent. However,
deMaria has been a member of the
WLUR community for nine years,
and he is in charge of the biggest
staff ever to work on the radio sta-
tion.

Since deMaria’s arrival at WLUR,
the station has acquired almost all
new equipment including a compact
disk player two years ago. Although
the station is in need of a new
transmitter, a twenty-five thousand
dollar project, deMaria feel that
WLUR has ‘“‘state of the art equip-
ment.” The station has grown and
prospered. For. example, in 1977,
WLUR had three hundred jazz
albums; now there are over four
thousand LP’s in the jazz collection.

DeMaria finds John D. Wilson,
president of W&L, very supportive of
WLUR, especially the classics
shows. Also, deMaria said “the

Ssivirw.

students are. very loyal and vocal.

why I love being in there."

This makes the station better.”’

The most popular music programs
on WLUR include Classical Show-
case, Third Ear, Afternoon Rock,
Oldies and Skyline Jazz. The music
that is played on WLUR is closely
monitored and carefully screened.
The staff of WLUR is in contact with
record companies that deMaria
thinks ‘‘will be supportive as long as
we play their music, keep in touch
and let them know what we are do-
ing.’’ WLUR follows a playlist from
“College Media Journal” and at least
half of all shows contain new music.

Another growing part of WLUR is
its new department. Although most
news is obtained from the Associated
Press, this is the first year that on-
the-spot radio reporting has been
successful. Monday through Friday,
a different story is reported on by a
Washington and Lee student. This
project works in correlation with the
Journalism Department and the
reporters earn one credit each.

DeMaria is pleased with the pro-
gress and success WLUR has achiey-
ed over its twenty year existence. He
notes that ‘‘before I came here, there
was a management turnover every
three or four years. I’ve been here

‘nine. I love my job and I love the

radio and T.V. stations a lot.”
Sharing deMaria’s enthusiastic at-
titude for WLUR, freshman Tanya
Pergola, classics and jazz disk
jockey, said, ‘‘being in the studio is
like being in an oasis: an escape from
the mayhem of the campus. That's

De Maria said the station was very

He improved the schedule, which
consisted of blocks of jazz, classics,
rock, news and public affairs
programming at specific times dur-

“Tt still serves mainly as an educa-

WP isch has shown that people in
offices tend to listen to classics dur-

in the early afternoon, de Maria said.
Students are in class at those times
and tend to listen to the radio less.

Late afternoon is an excellent time
for rock because it attracts both col-
lege and high school students, be
said. The station is run by W&L, but
it is licensed to serve Lexington and
Rockbridge County. So the program-
ming must serve more than just the
W&L students.

The evening music schedule begins
with classics, followed by _pro-

20th anniversay

This is not a story about USA To-
day, the fast-food of the nation’s
newspapers, but it is a story about
McNews.

More precisely, it’s the story of a
McMahon from Milwaukee known as
““McNews”’ — Timothy G. McNews.

A record buff since the time he
wore diapers, McMahon tried to get
on the Gong Show at the age of 10 by
impersonating a dead president. As a
teenager at Marquette University
High School, his dad’s alma mater,
he was very involved in acting and
forensics, not to mention a million-
and-one other activities.

Now, at 21, Mr. McNews is making
McWaves on the third floor of Reid
Hall as news director of WLUR-FM.
A German/journalism double major,
he’s worked with WLUR faculty ad-
viser Robert J. de Maria to create
what de Maria thinks is the best news
department the radio station has
ever had.

As always, the news staff broad-
casts daily, 30-minute newscasts at
noon, and news updates at 3 p.m. But
for the first time, those newscasts in-
clude actual reports filed by WLUR
staff reporters.

Having daily news reporters was
an idea that McMahon discussed with
de Maria last year, Each reporter
receives a graded independent study .
credit for his or her work.

McMahon’s job is to prepare daily

they often develop their own story
ideas, which is a major accomplish-
ment for a quintet of sophomores.
And not only are they reporting the
news, McMahon said, but they’ re ex-
cited about it. my

Much of the credit must go to Mr.
McNews, whose trademark is his not-
quite- -so-innocent, face-filling
McSmile.

know what they’re doing right and 4

wrong. But he’s always friendly
about it. And even when he’s serious
or upset, McMahon still flashes that
chummy Newmanesque (as in Alfred
E., not Paul) grin.

“Look at the guy and have him
smile at you, and you try to tell him,

the big brother to a lot of these kids.”’

McNews is limited because he has
only one reporter available each day.
“‘We can’t cover all the important or
relative meetings,” he said.

Although the station’s primary
responsibility is to W&L, McMahon
wants to be more involved in the
community. So his reporters also
cover - local’ government, school
boards and similar groups. He thinks
it’s important to report news not
directly related to W&L.

The two most important stories he
thinks the station’s covered this year
have been the John Read trial and
the resignation of Lexington Police
Chief L.O. Sutton.

A dorm counselor and recent ODK
inductee, McMahon -has done so
much that he had to leave ac-
complishments off his resume that
most students would have considered -
prime fodder. But he still would like
‘to complete two more big projects
before graduation.

One is a weekly, half-hour radio
news show.. “I. don’t -think | it’s
unrealistic on a trial basis right
now,’’ said McMahon, who envisions
a show focusing .on specific issues
‘and presenting an overview of the.
week’s events, He’d like to replay
each of the daily reports and con-
tribute some editorialinsights.. ~~.

McMahon was interested in broad- °
casting when he arrived at _— And

Fool around he did; At the age of 10,
he’d heard Vaughn Meader’s imper-
sonation of John F. Kennedy on ‘‘The
First Family’’ record album enough
times to do a pretty good impersona-
tion of Meader : rere the
president. ,

During the summer between: the
fifth and sixth grades, McMahon ar
his older brother, Pat, went :
California to visit relatives. The twa
had worked up a routine, with Pat ay
the interviewer andTim as JFK. |

The clincher was that tiny, smiling!
Tim sat in a high-backed chair. Thé
Gong Show audience would nevefi
have known he was a little kid unti
the very end of the act. His uncle
thought it was hysterical. ;

So Pat and Tim called the Gong
Show. Tim did his voice, pleading
with them to let him on. “They said
they would not accept acts that would
be demeaning to dead presidents, of
something like that,’’ he said. :

Undaunted, McMahon still playg
with his voice — impersonating Peg
Wee Herman, Billy Crystal and Mf
T. on his Monday Morning Magaziné
show. And McMultimediaman thé i
he is, he’s also managed to dabble is}
TV and print journalism, too. 4

He decided to stick with radio dury
ing his junior year. Although prinl
and television were definite options}
he’s glad he chose the post at WLUR

“I get to work with de Maria, who's}
an excellent teacher. He’s taught méj
an awful lot, and not just about jo’ u
n-"sm,’’ McMahon said. BS

He’s had the satisfaction of hearing!
other stations broadcast his news
reports. By recruiting plenty off
young broadcasters, he’s provided
for what should be a smooth transi‘)
tion next year. And his charm and wit}

_ have helped him develop personal

relationships with his staffers. a
Most of all, he’s met the magical
challenge of trying to paint pictures

In the past few years, the station’s

move applauded by de Maria. Pro-

higher than any number in the past,

represented, with many states doubl-

‘tionship with Lexington.

* Mann was born in Lexington to the
city’s most well-known doctor,
Robert S. Munger, 34 years ago. At
‘15, she went to a prep school in Ver-
mont where she began her photog-
raphy career with a $50 portrait job
‘of her roommate, the daughter of Ali
Shah Khan and Rita Hayworth.

She went from a Vermont prep
‘school to Vermon’t Bennington Col-
lege, a woman’s school that further
stimulated her interest in the arts.

* “T couldn’t have gone to any school
with rigid policies,’ Mann said in an
interview at her home. She said she
‘took as many photography and writ-
ing courses as she could and ignored
the other disciplines.

* “T am a functional fool in terms of
not having taken history and chem-
istry,” she said.

‘ Besides photography, Mann f
vanother subject she was interested
in: her future husband Larry Mann,
‘who is now a lawyer and city coun-

raphy and writing intermittently.

‘Street, Mann received her under-
«graduate and master’s degrees from
Hollins College.

* Why did Sally return home to Lex-
sington after being a world-traveler?

“T think there’s genuine concern
‘for people here,” she said. Her ex-
hibits in Lexington have drawn a
large number of area people, she
‘said, because the local people are in-
terested in what others in the com-
munity are doing.

” Many probably wondered what
Mann was doing when she wrapped
trees in her backyard with aluminum

 

And what about Gaines Hall? Is
this part of the big attempt to kill
fraternities?

“IT am not against fraternities,”
Wilson said. ‘‘I was a member of a
fraternity in college.”’

“Washington and Lee has had one
of the longest commitments to frater-

foil and put odd sculpture in her front
yard.

She has said that Lexington is a
fairly tolerant community but admits
many people are ‘‘easily shocked.”

“I tako my role as local iconoclast
quite seriously,’’ she said. ‘‘I think
it’s good for Lexington.”

“Complacency and contrived gen-
tility really irk me.”

Her work, the essence of Sally
Mann, may be contrived somewhat
but it is certainly not complacent
because photography, she said, must
be active.

“Art should be something that
makes you feel,” she said, and
photography in particular should
seek truth.

“Even if it’s a contrived picture,
I’mstill trying for the truth.”’

The truth she seeks in her photos
now is a long way from the truth she
recorded as a photographer for the
Washington and Lee news office in
the early 1970s. Maybe the difference
lies in the camera she used then and
the one she uses now.

In an interview with the Roanoke
Times and World-News three years
ago, Mann said working with her 100-
year-old view-finder camera did not
fit her spontaneous character.

Last week, however, she said the
large-format camera does comple-
ment her temperament.

“I’m plodding, methodical,’’ she
said, characteristics necessary for
working with a camera that does not
have the high shutter speed of a
35mm camera.

For her recent exhibit, Mann said
she often shot the subjects several
times to make sure the girl was com-
fortable with the photo and Mann was
satisfied with the image.

One quality that Mann said makes
a good picture, ‘‘detention of par-
ticulars,”’ is expressed particularly
well with the big camera because
prints made from the camera’s large
negatives usually are not enlarged.
Smaller negatives are enlarged and
the process tends to make lines and
small objects fuzzy as the print size
increases.

A good Sally Mann photo, she said,

“Washington and Lee has_ had

one of the longest commitments

to fraternities in the land.’

nities in the land. We depend on
fraternities for social activities, as
well as housing and food,’’ Wilson
said.

“What we need to do here is em-
phasize the fraternity houses
themselves...emphasize friends in
small groups having fun.”

“We need to get the houses behind
a more varied set of activities, not
just social activities.’

Fixing up the houses, and not hav-
ing parties that damage the property
are ways to do this, he said.

“We cannot afford to have 17
destroyed houses in town...also,
fraternities are starting to realize
their liabilities.”’

“Fraternity life at W&L used to
have a certain elegance...I’m sure
they knew how to party in the 50s, but
the fraternity houses were pleasant
places to live in then.”’

“We want to see the fraternities
develop a distinctive social style
again,” said Wilson. ‘‘Not a six-keg

is ‘the combination of strange and
jarring elements which, in a good
picture, for a sense of harmony.”

Some people who saw the ex-
hibit in the duPont Gallery apparent-
ly thought there were too many
strange and jarring elements in her
photos. Some of the comments in the
exhibit’s registration book said the
work was offensive and ugly.

“1 don’t like having to defend my
art,” Mann said. She said many of
the negative comments had come
from Washington and Lee students
and she believes their dislike of the
pictures may stem from not under-
standing the subjects, girls who are
predominantly from poor families.

“(The students) don’t know many
women like that.”’

Mann said Washington and Lee is
not the only place where her work
has been questioned.

“T think my critics run the gamut,”
she said.

Sally Mann does not have thin skin,
however. She said that bad com-
ments, though not ego boosters, are
more comforting than blank com-
ment hooks.

“A jblank space makes me
wonder,” she said. ‘I think they’re
good pictures so I’m not worried.”’

And worried she should not be
because her work has found a niche
in the inner circle of the art world.

The Polaroid Co. gave her thous-
ands of dollars worth of film and a
large-format Polaroid camera to
photograph different items she tosses
in a small wading pool she keeps in
her backyard.

The images of suspended, decom-
posed and odd objects are colorful
and mysterious.

She was one of a few photographers
in the country chosen for this project
and has traveled across the country
with the other artists promoting the
series.

Mann has also found a niche,
perhaps smaller than the one she oc-
cupies in photography, in the literary
circle. She said a book of her poems
will be published later this year.

Schroeder on women

‘
ByJOHNPENSEC

News Editor

 

" Surprise! Women didn’t come to
‘America on cruise ships. And they
didn’t ask where they could get their
nails done as soon as they set foot on
‘dry land.

, A woman, however, was responsi-
ble for the printing of the Declaration
‘of Independence. And a woman was
the only Revolutionary War soldier
buried at West Point. And Martha
‘Washington, wife of George, was
compensated by Congress for war-
time service. George said her
presence at Valley Forge inspired
the soldiers.

But many women don’t know about
‘what women have done in history, ac-
‘cording to Congresswoman Patricia
Schroeder (D-Colo), and neither do
men.

* Schroeder said that while many
women are struggling to juggle
careers and families, they don’t
realize that it has been done before.
Martha Washington, for example,
ran Mount Vernon from planting to
harvest each year and then went to
join her husband.

. Women still think they are lesser
beings is they are not able to manage
both a career and a family, said
Schroeder. And according to Labor
Department statistics, 9-out-of-10
women will have to work at some
point in their lives. Very few women,
she said, have the option of choosing
between a career and raising a fami-
ly.
Schroeder spoke Monday in Nor-
then Auditorium as the maiden
speaker in the Otey Lecture Series,

a

 

an endowed lecture series in honor of
one of the first suffragettes.

The whole point of the series, said
Schroeder, is to show what women
have done. They are not asking to
walk behind men, nor in front of
them, but rather walk by their sides,
she said. ‘“They are not asking for
more, they are asking for equal.”’

Schroeder was first elected to Con-
gress in 1972. She is the dean of the
Colorado delegation, the most senior
woman in Congress and is the Demo-
cratic whip. She said she knows first-
hand what it is like to try and balance
a career and a family. However, ‘‘We
are not superwomen,”’ she said.

In talking about the American
family, Schroeder, the founder of the
Congressional Caucus on Women’s
Issues, said that there is no option,
we must do something about the

American family. One of the first
places to start, she said, is to stop
thinking of it as male versus female,
and start thinking of it as family.

The divorce rate in the United
States is one of the highest in the
western world, and the lowest paid
workers are day-care workers and
teachers.

“What are we saying about our
young people?”’ she asked.

Schroeder is co-sponsor of a bill
that would allow general wage
earners six moths leave without pay
if taken sick and four months leave
without pay if they have or adopt a
child. These are compromises, but
Schroeder admitted they were better
than nothing.

The United States is not the first
country to adopt a policy like this,
said Schroeder. It is the last.

 

party were the local high-school kids
wander in.”

“We need to get a generation in
here that doesn’t remember being
legal to drink.”

Wilson thinks all the fraternity
houses can survive.

When the guidelines for co-ed
enrollment were set in 1984, he said,
1,000 men were thought to be enough
to keep the fraternity system going.

In 1984, the last year before co-ed,
824 men out of 1,300 were frat
members, or about 60 percent.

If fraternities could be made more
appealing, it was reasoned, more
men would join. If 80 percent of 1,000
men pledged, the frats would still
have their 800 men.

Over 80 percent of this year’s
freshman class did pledge this year,
but the members were not spread out
evenly between the houses.

The future, Wilson said, will show
whether each house can get its share
of the 80 percent.

Sampson is to appeal

 

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Assignments Editor

Phillip L. Sampson Jr., the
freshman who was suspended by the
Student Conduct Committee last
week for shooting a 15-year-old girl
with a blowdart, said Tuesday he
would appeal the decision.

Sampson’s appeal was scheduled
to be considered today by the Student
Affairs Committee, according to
Dean of Students Lewis G. John,
chairman of the 10-member SAC.
That committee has the options of
upholding the SCC’s decision or
reducing the penalty, John said. It
cannot vote for a harsher penalty.

On Jan. 29, Sampson was placed on
social probation and conduct proba-
tion by the 13-student SCC. The SAC
reviewed the case and asked the SCC
to reconsider its findings.

The SCC then voted to suspend
Sampson, a freshman from Houston,
for shooting the girl in the shoulder
with the dart.

e growth in enrollment, Wilson
thinks, does not effect W&L’s status
as a teaching institution.

“Our faculty-student ratio is
higher now than it was four years
ago...teaching is still the primary
obligation of the faculty.”

More money is being allocated to
encourage professors to do research
over the summer, but these ‘‘profes-
sional activities’ will not interfere
with teaching he said.

“This is a teaching institution from
September to June...(though) it is
important that faculty stay in touch
with their peers; we are small and
isolated.”

“Faculty members still teach
three courses each, so they can ask
for writing and have personal rela-
tionships with students,’’ he said.

According to Wilson, class sizes
have not increased substantially.

“We looked at class size...the
number of classes with under 30
students has stayed the same. There
are 11 classes with over 40 students.”’

These larger classes, he said, are
mostly with the more popular pro-
fessors, particularly in the history
department, which had three mem-
bers on leave last term.

Overall, he said, W&L can main-
tain its small class sizes.

The president hears all the
criticism leveled at ‘‘the administra-
tion’’ but, to his way of thinking, this
is just part of the transition.

“T have to try desperately to keep
perspective, and that’s dreadfully
hard to do...I have to keep telling
myself to slow down, don’t overad-
ministrate.”’

“We reconsidered the case and felt
a mistake had been made in a few dif-
ferent areas, and therefore changed
our decision,’ SCC Chairman
Michael R. McAllister said in an in-
terview this week. ‘‘The Student Con-
duct Committee is content with the
decision.”

John said that the SAC agreed with
the SCC’s finding that Sampson was
guilty of a major offense under
university rules because he inflicted
bodily injury. The only two penalties
that may be given for such an offense
are suspension and expulsion, unless
the case involves “unusual extenua-
tion.”

John said the SAC could not find
any extenuating circumstances. It
did not ask for a specific penalty,
John said, only that the initial penal-
ty be reconsidered.

The girl, a local high school stu-
dent, is the daughter of W&L
Associate Dean of Students Leroy C.
“Buddy” Atkins. She was hit in the
shoulder but was not injured serious-
ly.

know if it’s the same person or not,”’
said Murray.

In a separate incident, Bernard
Merchant III, 25, has been charged
with statutory burglary, petit
larceny and grand larceny in connec-
tion with thefts last week from
Gilliam Dorm.

Thefts in the dorms and campus
buildings have been on the rise, said
Murray. “I think if students would
just lock their doors,’’ it would deter
many thefts, said Security Officer

With that class, the undergraduate
enrollment will reach 1,500, and in-

Trustees voted to increase under-
graduate enrollment in 1984.

rooms in Gaines Hall have been re-
served, and that the construction is

stained when that body voted to send
Sampson’s case back to the SCC,
John said.

Sampson told the Phi three weeks
ago that he did not shoot Atkins’
daughter on purpose, that he had not
meant to hit anyone with the dart and
that he didn’t find out that the girl
had been hit until the next day.

The incident occurred after the
W&L-Roanoke basketball game on
Jan. 15. Sampson said he shot the
dart from a second-floor window of
the Graham-Lees dorm toward some
Roanoke fans who were making
degrading comments to incite the
W&L students. He estimated that the
Roanokers were between 50 and 75
yards away.

Sampson said he knew he could not
shoot the dart that far but thought
that it might intimidate them.

University Proctor Charles F.
‘“Murph” Murray said the dart was
at least four inches long. It hit the girl
in the back of the shoulder, Atkins
said, penetrating about a half-inch in-
to her skin.

Kreps calls for involvement

 

By JEFF HARWOOD
Staff Reporter

 

Juanita Kreps, the first woman and
the first economist to serve as United
States Secretary of Commerce, call-
ed on the United States to become
more involved in international trade
Tuesday night.

Speaking in Lee Chapel, Kreps said
that “economists always give a
gloomy message” and that ‘we all
share a common interest: our
careers.

“Careers are linked, directly or in-
directly, with business affairs and
performance of economy,” she said.

Kreps, commerce secretary for
President Jimmy Carter from
1977-1979, said the imbalance of inter-
national trade has caused the United
States to ‘feel a greater economic
vulnerability.” Future economic
development in the United States
must involve the international
market.

And she warned that American in-
dustries are expected to face more
difficulties in the future. Citing
various facts and statistics, Kreps

described “Japan as the greatest
saver and the United States as the
greatest borrower.”’

The mixture of ‘Anglo-Saxon
hedonism and Oriental thrift’ has
caused economic conflict which, con-
trary to some American theories, is
not caused solely by the high value of
the U.S. dollar, according to Kreps.
In response to the United States’ re-
quest that other countries stimulate
their economies, nations such as Ger-
many have said it is the responsibili-
ty of the United States.

“Should the United States en-
courage the thrifty Japaneses and
other investors around the world to
acquire U.S. debts and private pro-
perty,’’ Kreps asked, ‘‘or should we
involve domestic policies that would
discourage conumption and _ en-
courage greater savings?”’

If it is the latter, she said, ‘‘The ’86
tax reform moved us in the wrong
direction.”

Many U.S. companies are moving
to Japan and other countries in the
Pacific where they will have room to
develop more efficiently, Kreps said.
The U.S. “adjustment has not been
smooth, nor complete.

“We must invest in human re-
sources,”’ she said.

She suggested that instead of pro-
tecting our industries that sell higher
priced goods, the American public
should be willing to raise the educa-
tion and skill level of the workers
whose jobs are jeopardized by
foreign industries.

In an attempt to lessen interna-
tional trade conflicts, the United
States and Japan have established
economic pledges. Kreps said the
United States requested a ‘‘reduction
in Japan’s discount rate and a
budgetary proposal designed to
stimulate the Japanese economy. In
return, the United States pledged its
opposition to protectionist measures
and promised significant and steady
reductions in the federal deficit.’’

When confronted about the
economic policies of the Carter ad-
ministration, Kreps instead noted the
deficit increase and the current inter-
national trade imbalance of the
Reagan administration.

“You have to balance them,”’ she
said. ‘‘You make your decision, I'l!
make mine.”

Point cards cause jump in sales

By GEORGE G. SPARACIO
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee Snack
Bar has been experiencing over-
crowding this year due to the use of
point cards, which have been at-
tributed to an increase in sales of
over 50 percent.

Overcrowding at the snack bar has
been of concern to the Food Service
and to some students. To deal with
this, the snack bar opens two
registers at crowded times.

Junior Karl Brewer said, ‘‘It really
doesn’t bother me that much. You
know it’s going to be crowded five
minutes before class. If that bothers
you go at a different time.’’ Soph-
omore Gregory Castonuovo explain-
ed, ‘It’s hard to get a quick bite or
drink between classes.”’

About five years ago, Gerald J.
Darrell, Director of University Food
Services, introduced the point card to

Washington and Lee as a conven-
ience to the students. Prior to this,
the only alternative was the 20-meal
plan.

Last year, Darrell introduced the
use of the point card in GHQ. In addi-
tion, students on the 20-meal plan
were permitted to eat in the GHQ as
an alternative. However, there was
not enough room to accommodate the
20-meal plan, so it was discontinued
in the GHQ.

Students came to Darrell last year
requesting that he devise a plan
allowing students to use their point
cards at the snack bar. Darrell said
that the purpose of the Food Service
is “to provide a service to the
students.’’ He went on to say that the
use of the point card at the snack bar
benefits all students.

Sales at the snack bar have dou-
bled this year. Richard L. Arm-
strong, Snack Bar Manager, said,
“The point card created a very

substantial increase in business.”’
Armstrong said that last year, the
snack bar had only two days in which
sales went over $1,000. This year,
they are averaging over $1,400 a day,
and only twice have they dipped
below the $1,000 mark, Junior John
Packett said, ‘I think it’s great for a
bite to eat and a place to hang.”’

In addition, Armstrong explained
that the point card produces substan-
tial savings. There is no tax on items
purchased with the card, giving the
student a seven percent discount.
Also there are specials in both the
GHQ and the snack bar providing
students with an additional 15 to 20
percent discount. Darrell also said
that over 80 percent of the students
charge their point card home.

In the future, there are plans for a
Bookstore/Snack Bar renovation.
Darrell said, ‘It’s going to be a big
project and we're really excited
about it.”’

Generals clip Eagles {|

to maintain 4th spot

 

By MIKE SHADY
Assistant Sports Editor

 

With just over two weeks left
before the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference tournament, the Wash-
ington & Lee basketball team im-
proved it chances of gaining a
fourth-place position with an upset
win over Bridgewater College, 72-67,
Tuesday night on the road.

The Generals have won two
straight with their victory last Satur-
day over Emory University in the
Warner Center. W&L had its last two-
game win streak stopped last Thurs-
day when Emory and Henry beat up
on the hoopsters, 97-83.

If the Generals can win two of their
next three ODAC games, they will
almost be assured of one of the top
four spots and the home court advan-
tage in the opening round of the
tourney. The squad travels to
Roanoke Saturday and then has
Eastern Mennonite and Maryville on
Feb. 17 and 20.

Bridgewater came into the game in
first place in the ODAC with an 8-2
record, a half game ahead of Emory
and Henry and a full game in front of
Roanoke. But it was the Genrals who
came out looking like the number one

 

a

i

 

team, taking control of the contest
from the opening tip

Playing in front of a partisan
crowd of over 400 people, W&L open-
ed up a nine-point lead eight minutes
into the first half and never trailed
the rest of the way. Junior Steve Han-
cock was the main man for the
Generals, scoring 10 of his game total
12 points in the first 20 minutes. W&L
maintained its advantage until half-
time, leading 40-31 at the intermis-
sion.

Ramsey Yeatts, the ODAC’s
leading scorer, decided to put on a
show in the second half. On a variety
of running jumpers and slashing
drives to the basket, Yeatts proved to
everyone in attendance why he is the
premier player in the conference this
season. He single-handedly brought
the Eagles to within four points with
still over five minutes remaining.

However, the Generals kept their
cool. Showing patience on offense
and even running when the oppor-
tunity present itself, the team jacked
its lead back up to as much as eleven
72-61, with only 1:32 showing on the
clock.

Then the Generals pretended they
were playing Hampden-Sydney in-
stead of the Eagles. If you
remember, the Generals squandered
a 10-point lead in two minutes against
<ne Tigers and ended up in the loser’s

 

circle. W&L’s self destruction this
time began when Hancock and senior
Rob Spencer combined to miss five
front-ends of one-and-one situations.
Neither team starred at the line as
the Eagles shot an anemic 46 percent
while W&L fared little better at 52
percent. A turnover and five-second
call later and Bridgewater was back
in business trailing by five with 22
seconds left.

“We got cautious,” senior Jeffer-
son Harralson, who led the Generals
with 19 points, said. ‘We don’t play
well when we play cautious.

“We thought they had given up
when they took [Yeatts] out but that
may have been a plan in order to get
us to relax. I was kind of relieved
when he went out,”’ he said.

Yeatts returned to the game only to
miss two three-point shots and, for-
tunately for the Generals, time ran
out on the Eagles.

“Coach [head coach Verne Can-
field] was pretty happy about the
game,” Harralson said. ‘‘He was just
happy to get out of there with the
win.”

Sparked by junior Gary Schott’s
career-high 16 points, W&L pounded
Emory University by thirteen, 85-72.
Despite the point differential,
however, Canfield was not pleased.

Team effort paces

’ By JIMLAKE
. Staff Reporter

 

Thanks to what head coach Norris
- Aldridge called ‘‘a good team ef-
. fort,’ the Washington & Lee indoor
- track team won five events and took
second place overall in a meet at
Lynchburg College last Saturday.
The overall winner of the meet was
- Virginia State with 130 points. The
Generals scored 110 points and were
followed by the host team with 94
points. High Point College took fourth
with 85 points, and Old Dominion
Athletic Conference members
Bridgewater and Roanoke rounded
out the scoring with 41 and 23 points.
Looking at the field events,
Aldridge cited senior Thomas Mur-
ray as one of the top performers for
the Generals. Murray won the shot
put with a throw of 48’5’’, just 4 in-
ches shy of the school record.

‘track to 2nd place

Sophomore Fray McCormick won the
high jump by clearing 6’2”’.

In the pole vault, the Generals took
first, third and forth place, despite
having lost their two top pole
vaulters earlier in the week. Senior
Matthew Steilberg broke his heel in
practice last Friday, and freshman
Phillip Sampson, who set a school
record by clearing 14’6’’ at VMI last
Saturday, was suspended from the
University last Wednesday. Never-
theless, senior John Carter won the
event with a vault of 12’6”’, and junior
Robert Williamson and Joseph
Fisher also placed.

In the sprints, Aldridge was par-
ticularly pleased with the perfor-
mance of junior Andrew White who
took third in the high hurdles with a
time of 7.8 seconds and ran the 400-
meter hurdles in 54.5 seconds,
finishing fourth in that event.

The Generals also performed well
in the distance events, with
sophomore Jamie Urso taking first in

W&L edges W&M as:

divers prove crucial |

 

From Staff Reports

 

The Washington & Lee men’s
swimming team finished its dual
meet season last Saturday with a win
over William & Mary at Williams-
burg. The five point victory, 111-106,
pushed the Generals’ dual meet
record to 8-1, the best record in head
coach Page Remillard’s eight year
W&L career.

Remillard said that W&L has
beaten W&M four years running, and
the only ‘reason they [W&M] won
before was because diving carried
their swimming.’’ This year,
however, the greatly improved W&L
diving team was the difference.

Remillard stated that ‘our diving
team perservered.”’ He felt that he
and the swimmers ‘‘were really
pleased to see them diving well.”

He added that this is a ‘‘good sign,
we are trying to do something about
our weakness [diving].”” ‘Tom
Amico is the reason why there has
been great improvement this year.”
Amico has basically been the diving
team for almost three years, and his
individual improvement this year,
Remillard feels, has led the rest of

the divers.

Reflecting on the end of the dual
meet season, Remillard said that ‘‘it
has been the best season at W&L”’
since he has been at the helm. He felt
that this was due to the student-
athletes ‘‘out there getting the job
done.”

Remillard attributes the overall
positive team attitude, which was
‘started by the water polo team” has
been carried on by ‘‘an exceptional
group, with captains Jay Reville and
Moose Herring leading.”

This winning attitude, along with a
strong desire to work for success, is
shared by the Women’s squad, which
lays its .500 season on the line Thurs-
day night at Hollins. Remillard felt
that “under the intense academic
pressure of this week,’”’ the women
will have ‘‘to pull a rabbit out of the
hat’ if they are to beat Hollins.

Feeling this study crunch, the team
will compete without freshman
Heather Logan, who owns the top Old
Dominion Athletic Conference times
in both the 100- and 200-yard

breastroke events. Remillard felt
“satisfied [in knowing that this] test

= ‘
of our priorities, academics over
athletics, was successful.” ,

The women have shown their abili-
ty to pull out rabbits, though, as»
evidenced by their win over Sweet,
Briar on Jan. 14, with the top In-
dividual Medley swimmer freshman!
Debbie Grove hampered by the flu.

Remillard said positively that,:
“the women don’t seem concerned”’
about the loss of Logan and the cer-'
tain closeness of th: meet. He added
that ‘‘it will take 66 points to win, and
if we win, we will have less that 70.” *

As the teams look towards Tri-
States, to be swum Feb. 19-21 at ‘
Frostburg, their sights also turn to ,
Nationals in March. The men are
quite strong this year, with swim- ‘
mers in Division III top five in six dif- ,
ferent events.

Freshman David Olson leads the
way, currently ranked second in the’
nation in the 100-yard backstroke and »

The W&L indoor track team, shown in action from the VMI Relays, is aiming to defend its ODAC title on Feb. 28.

the 1000-meter run with a time of
2:23.5. Junior Scott Rippeon won the
two mile, finishing in 10:13.6, and
junior James Buquet ran the 800-
meters in 2:13.5, good enough for
fourth place.

Despite suprisingly poor perfor-
mances in this meet by ODAC
members Bridgewater and Roanoke,
Aldridge says that the Generals need

to show further improvement in
order to have a chance to win the
ODAC championship meet, which
will be held at VMI on Feb. 28. ‘‘It’s
still too early in the season to dis-
count anyone,”’ said Aldridge

The Generals’ head coach is look-
ing forward to entering some of his
athletes in the Lynchburg Relays this
Saturday and in a meet at Virginia

Tech the following weekend. These
two events will give Aldridge a
valuable look at the Roanoke
distance runners, who did not com-
pete in Lynchburg last Saturday, and
at the Emory & Henry team, which
Aldridge says has some good athletes
in the shot put and long jump and
may have the best pole vaulter in the
conference.

But, for most of the Generals, the
upcoming holiday will provide a
week of relaxation which Aldridge
says has been helpful to his team’s
performance in previous years. ‘‘For
the athletes that will go home and do
some running, [the week of] keeps
them in shape but lets their legs
come back. We’re been training pret-
ty hard these past five or six weeks.”’

Wrestlers win one of three;
final meet set for Saturday

By DAVID EMRICH
Sports Editor

 

One up, two down.

That was the story of the Wash-
ington & Lee wrestling team last
week.

The Generals went to the mat three
times, but came away with the vic-
tory only once.

On Saturday, at a dual meet in Lex-
ington, the Generals beat Gallaudet
40-18, but were on the short side of the
decision against Washington & Jef-
ferson, 29-18.

SWIM

O continued from page 6

 

Olson, has qualified for the Division
III championships, to be held in Can-
ton, Ohio, Mar. 19-21.

Last night, the Generals travelled
to Farmville, only to have Longwood
defeat them, 29-18.

The Generals’ record now stands at
7-5 on the season.

‘‘We felt they were a better team
than us,”’ said W&L head coach Gary
Franke.

Winning for the Generals last night
were junior Steve Castle at 126 lbs.,
senior Jeff Mazza at 134 Ibs.,
sophomore Rich Redfoot at 177 Ibs.,
and sophomore George Loupassi at
190 Ibs.

Another Nationals qualifier is the
400-yard Medley Relay team of Olson
(backstroke), senior Marty Radvany
(breaststroke), Bercaw (butterfly),
and sophomore David Dietz (free-

style). The relay team is currently
ranked third, behind St. Olaf and

Kenyon, two perennial Div. Ill
powerhouses.

Castle, who normally wresties at
118 lbs., moved up a weight class last
night to 126 lbs. This gave Longwood
a victory by forfeit at 118 Ibs.

Franke explained, ‘‘We felt
changes had to be made to beat
[Longwood].

“We did some juggling with our
lineup but it didn’t work out.”

Last Saturday, at the dual meet,
the Generals defeated Gallaudet
rather handily, but found Washington
and Jefferson too much to handle.

Winning in both contests for the
Generals were Castle at 118 lIbs.,

The 400-yard freestyle relay of Ber-
caw, sophomores Matt Brady and
David Reavy, and Dietz, are current-
ly ranked fourth nationally.

Senior Jay Reville is currently
ranked number five in the nation in
the 400-yard Individual Medley.

For the women, sophomore Eliz-
abeth Miles qualified for nationals in

Mazza at 134 ibs., and senior Tim
Walker at 142 Ibs.

Castle and Mazza were the only
General wrestlers to win all their
matches last week.

This Saturday W&L will host
Davidson at 2:00 p.m. and Hampden-
Sydney at 4:30 p.m.

This represents a change from the
original schedule where W&L was
supposed to face Davidson on the
road.

Apparently Davidson called and
suggested the new arrangements and
all involved parties agreed.

the 1650-yard freestyle.

Remillard has stated that he feels
that such mid-season listings are
good incentives, but as far as na-
tional standings go, he feels that
“polls are polls,” and that “they
don’t mean a thing until all the swim-
mers meet [at Nationals).”’

 

   

 

 

 

 

&L Athlete of the Week

 

By JOHN PACKETT
Staff Reporter

 

 

 

Elizabeth Miles, the women’s
swim team captain, qualified for
the nationals by finishing first in
the 1650-yard freestyle with a
time of 19:13.00, making her
Washington & Lee’s athlete of the
week,

Miles also placed second in the
100-meter freestyle in the meet
against Mary Washington.

Miles was an Honorable Men-
tion all-American last year and
received W&L’s Outstanding
Woman Athlete for 1985-1986.

Miles said that by qualifying for
one event in the nationals she is
allowed to compete in three, a new
rule established this year.

“It used to be you could only
compete in the event in which you
qualified,”’ said Miles.

To make all-America, Miles
said she has to place in the top
eight of an event. Anything under
the top eight is considered to be
honorable mention.

The nationals are Mar. 13-15 in

Canton, Ohio.

Miles said the team has improv-
ed a lot from last year’s winless
team, which had only three mem-
bers.

“This year we are 43 and are
competing with eight swimmers,”
said Miles.

Miles said the biggest win of the
year was the General’s victory
over Sweet Briar, last year’s
defending Old Dominion Athletic
Conference champions.

The next big meet is the Tri-
States at Frostburg College in
Maryland.

“‘We are psyched for the meet
because it is a real chance to do
well against good competition,”
said Miles.

The training on the swim team
is rough, according to Miles.
Right now the team gets up at 6
a.m. and lifts weights for 45
minutes. Then they practice for 2
1/2 hours in the afternoon.

Miles is a sophomore from
Louisville, KY where she attended
Louisville Collegiate School.

Miles is a psychology major.

Second to no one

The other night one of my friends was leafing through last year’s
Calyx. When he got to the section on the sports teams he said, in-
dignantly, ‘‘Look at this, Lacrosse got three pages!”

I knew why he was upset. You see, my friend is on the swim team
and he feels, like so many other athletes, that his sport is under-
covered. So I asked him how many pages of copy the swim team had
gotten. He said, “‘One ... for both the men’s and women’s teams.”

I looked at him, sort of half smiled, and told him, ‘‘That’s the way it
is.”

People are more interested in some sports than others. Basketball is
more popular than wrestling. Football always gets more spectators
than soccer. And, since there are more lacrosse fans than swimming
fans, lacrosse will naturally get more coverage than swimming. It has
always been that way and it will always be that way.

Athletes who compete in so called secondary sports don’t get the
same fan support as the more popular sports, and this can be
frustrating. A football player struggling to get through a long practice
session can keep the feeling he gets from the fans cheering him on
Saturday afternoon in the back of his mind, but what does the cross-
country runner have to look forward to?

This is especially true at Washington and Lee where support for the
sports teams is pretty much limited to the big three of football, basket-
ball, and lacrosse (and even these don’t always generate that much
student interest).

Athletes who excel at lacrosse will always get more recognition than
those who excel at swimming. Not because one is more difficult than
the other, nor because one requires more work than the other. It’s that
way simply because more people are interested in lacrosse than swim-

Now please don’t get the idea that I’m trying to play holier than
thou. I’m just as guilty as anyone else. I’m much more likely to take a
seat at Wilson Field and watch the Generals play UVa. in lacrosse
than I am to be at Twombly pool to watch the finish of the 100-meter
butterfly against Sweet Briar. But that’s not the point.

Nor is it the point that we should ignore the big three sports in favor
of the rest. By all means Jefferson Harralson deserves all the credit he
gets when he pours in 24 points as does John Church when he stops 25
shorts on goal. But don’t Rich Moore, Ted Myers and Scott Rippeon
deserve just as much credit?

Who, you ask, are Rich Moore, Ted Myers, and Scott Rippeon?
They’re the three W&L cross-country runners who qualified for na-
tionals this past fall. Isn’t that just as impressive as anything any
other athlete has done this year? Still, few people realize that the
cross-country team sent anyone to nationals, much less remember
their names.

The problem with our myopic view of the sports world is that many
great athletes get lost in the shadows cast by the most popular sports.

This year, Chris Gaeris set the W&L career record for most shutouts
by a soccer goalie, and he’s only a junior. How many people know
that? Last year, Tim Stanford was named all-American in both water
polo and in swimming. Yet very few people know who he is. Would that
have been the case if he had won similar honors in football and
lacrosse?

I’m not expecting that Twombly poo! will be packed at the next swim
meet. Watching sports is a form of entertainment, and it certainly
isn’t wrong to choose not to watch a sport you don’t find entertaining —
It is wrong, however, to assume that secondary sports produce second
class athletes.

Writers meet at SBC

Staff Reporter

 

Sharon Olds. Bobbie Ann Mason.
Jay McInerney. Robert Pinksky.

Not only is this a list of some of the
best contemporary writers in Amer-
ica, but it is also sample of some of
the guest speakers currently par-
ticipating in Sweet Briar College’s
“Writing In The ’80’s” Literary
Festival. The festival, which began
last night with a panel discussion will
continue through Friday afternoon.

The critics’ panel is Richard Eder,
principal book critic for The Los
Angeles Times, and Stephen Tap-
scott, who teaches at MIT and Cor-
nell and has distinguished himself as
a poet and translator as well as a
critic. Last night they discussed the
work of the visiting authors, in-
fluences upon them and their rela-
tionships to works by other contem-
porary writers.

This afternoon, Jay McInerney
gave a reading to begin the writers
portion of the festival. McInerney is
the author of two novels: ‘Bright
Lights, Big City’ and ‘‘Ransom.” He
has also been published in magazines
ranging from The Paris Review to
Playboy. “Bright Lights, Big City,”
has extremely successful first novel,
distinguished him as the most elo-
quent voice of the disenchanted
younger generation populating the
clubs and office buildings of New
York and is also currently being
made into a motion picture.
McInerney was born in Hartford,
Connecticut and has lived in London,
Vancouver, Tokyo and New York.

Also reading this afternoon was
poet Robert Pinsky. Pinsky was at
Washington and Lee last Spring in
conjunction with the Glasgow endow-
ment. His most recent collection,
“History of My Heart” (Ecco, 1984),
was awarded the William Carlos
Williams prize by the Poetry Society
of America. Pinsky is considered to
be one of the finest poet-critics at
work in America today. He also
teaches at the University of Califor-
nia, Berkeley and spent seven years
as the poetry editor of The New
Republic.

This evening at eight o’clock, Bob-
bie Ann Mason will give a reading of
her very distinctive fiction. Mason
paints unforgettable portraits of the
varied inhabitants of the New South

with a straightforward, powerful pro-
se style that earned her the Ernest
Hemingway award for the most dis-
tinguished first-published work of fic-
tion in 1982 for ‘‘Shiloh and Other
Stories.’’ Mason currently resides in
Pennsylvania with her husband.
Following coffee and doughnuts at
10:00 tomorrow morning will be a
reading by poet Sharon Olds. Olds
has taught at both New York Univer-
sity and Columbia University. Her
second book of poetry, ‘“‘The Dead
and the Living,’’ was named the La-
mont Poetry Selection of the
Academy of American Poets and in
1985 received the National Book
Critics’ Circle Award for poetry. Her
most recent book, ‘‘The Gold Cell,”
appeared this past January.
Tomorrow afternoon at 2:30, the

literary festival will culminate with a
writers’ panel in which McInerney,
Olds, Mason and Pinsky will discuss
their own work and that of their con-
temporaries as well as the state of
contemporary fiction and _ issues
which affect it.

The Writing in the 80’s Literary
Festival is being sponsored by the
Sweet Briar College Lectures Com-
mittee and the Sue Reid Slaughter
Fund of the Sweet Briar Alumnae
Association. It was organized and
coordinated by Cheryl Mares, Har-
riet Pollack and Janet Sylvester. Of-
fering a line-up of first rate in-
fluences on the best literature being
produced in the United States, the
Writing in the 80’s Festival promises
to be the foremost literary lecture
series in this area in 1987.

How to escape a formula:
Go down-under with Dundee

 

By MICHAEL TUGGLE
Movie Critic

 

Question: Is it possible for a comedy to
succeed outside of the standard com-
edic formulas established in the 80's
(i.e. loss of virginity, taking advantage
of satirized adults by manipulative
adolescents, or taking advantage of
satirized adults by manipulative
adolescents resulting in the loss of
virginity)?

Answer: Absolutely {i.e. “Crocodile
Dundee”)!

Paul Hogan’s ‘Crocodile Dundee’”’ is
like a fresh breath of cool air; it
wakes you up, it’s refreshing, and it
just makes you feel good. As of
January 14, it was ranked third on
the listing for theatre earnings and
had moved into the 43rd position on
the All-Time list, moving ahead of
such classics as “Doctor Zhivago’’,
“The Graduate”, “Out of Africa’,
and ‘‘Apocalypse Now.” This gem
from Austrailia is definitely one of
the year’s best and is destined to give
Hogan the popularity in the U.S. that
he already has Down Under.

The film chronicles the adventures
of Crocodile Dundee, a playfully
egotistic hunter from the outback
who was raised by Aboriginees.
While the film contains traces of the
Greystroke tradition, Dundee is a far
cry from Tarzan. He’s more like the
Artful Dodger in the body of Indiana
Jones. So, we have a hero but no lady
in distress. Enter Sue Charlton (Lin-
da Koslowski), a New York reporter
sent to do a story on ‘“‘The Crocodile
Man.” Her interest turns to fascina-
tion as she and Dundee troop through
the outback together, experiencing
crocodiles, Aboriginees, and fresh-
water lakes ideal for swimming
(need I draw a picture? ). As her time
with Dundee dwindles, her fascina-
tion turns to infatuation (surprise! )
and she asks Dundee to come back to
New York with her as a follow-up to
the story. Right.

The remainder of the film is what
makes it such a pleasure to see. The
naivety and innocence of Hogan’s
character is wonderful and gives
native Americans a real eye opening
account of what it must be like to

come to the U.S. from a technolog-
ically poor homeland. From the mo-
ment he lands in New York, Dundee
moves through a series of classi
scenes. When he is picked up at the
airport in the Newspaper limosine he
is introduced to Gus, the black chauf-
feur. Dundee immediately asks ‘‘Hey
Gus, What tribe are you from?”
When he is told the population of New
York he replies, ‘‘All those people;
living together — New York must be
the friendliest place in the world.”
Hogan is fantastic as Dundee and
provides laugh after laugh. The
scenes where he encounters pro-
stitutes, transvestites, and cocaine
are especially hilarious.

“Crocodile Dundee’’ is a first-rate
production. The acting is well-done,
the humor very funny, and the cine-
matography of Austrailia, often
reminiscent of ‘‘Oout of Africa,’’
quite beautiful. No worries mate!
This film is a treat and one that
shouldn’t be missed.
