Olin wins
in landslide

 

By CHRIS MUNSEY
Staff Reporter

 

Incumbent Democrat Jim Olin won
a smashing victory over Republican
challenger Flo Traywick in Tues-
day’s election, capturing 78 percent
of the popular vote from the people of
Rockbridge County.

Olin’s 78 percent of the vote
represents the highest margin of re-
election he has won from area voters
in the past three Congressional
races. Olin won 58 percent of the vote
recorded in Lexington and Rock-
bridge County in the ’84 election,
against the 42 percent of Republican
Ray L. Garland.

Olin was first elected to the 6th
district in 1982, winning 51 percent of
local voters. Republican Kevin G.
Miller lost by only three percentage
points in the 1982 election.

Four amendments to the state con-
stitution of Virginia were also ap-
proved by state and local voters. The
first amendment allows a person
removed from registration list of
eligible voters to re-register through
the mail. Under present law, a per-
son who doesn’t vote at least once in
four years is automatically removed
from the registration lists and must
show up in person to re-register.

The second amendment approved
allows government employees to

serve as assistant registrars and of-
ficers of election. The current law
prohibits government employees
from these positions.

The third amendment allows the
Virginia Supreme Court to respond
on matters of state law to federal
courts and the appellate courts of
other states. The final amendment
gives the state the right to appeal
court decisions that dismiss a defen-
dant or supress evidence. The state
will only be allowed to appeal before
the jury is sworn in or before the first
witness is heard ina non-jury trial.

Traywick tried to portray Olin as a
liberal out of touch with the philo-
sophy of the 6th district, and promis-
ed to support the goals of the Reagan
administration if she was elected.
Olin consistently dodged the liberal
label and stressed his businesslike
approach in Congress during the
campaign.

Flo Traywick spent eight years in
the Virginia legislature as a
legislative aide to Vance Wilkens, the
Republican delegate who represents
Rockbridge County in Richmond.
Traywick is also a member of the
Republican National Committee.

Jim Olin has lived in the Salem
area since 1968, when he became the
manager of a local General Electric
factory. Olin retired from GE in 1982
and ran for Congress the first time
that year.

The Flood of ’85,
a year later

By TOM BRICKEL
Staff Reporter

 

To most Washington and Lee
students, the flood is but a faint
memory of showerless nights and
threatened power shortages. To
others, that there ever was a flood is
a new and surprising fact.

Flooding began after Parents’
Weekend last year, the result of three
days worth of rain that reached a
crescendo on Monday. The effects of
flooding in the area were felt im-
mediately. The Maury river swelled
to the height of the Maury river
bridge, inundating houses in the flood
plain with water and debris. The
water level in Woods Creek also rose,
covering low-lying footpaths and
moving the small footbridge down-
stream.

Some students were affected by
rising water levels: those living in
Bean’s Bottom and in residences
close to the river had to evacuate
their homes when waters rose sever-
al feet in a matter of hours early
Tuesday morning. But most students
living in dormitories or residences
high above the flood waters were
unaffected by the flood’s damage.
Downed telephone lines did reduce
service for a few days after the flood,
but it was resumed soon after

Students suffered one side effect
from the flood: a request made by
Lexington Mayor and W&L econo-
mics professor Charles F. Phillips,
Jr. to refrain from using water for
purposes other than for cooking,
drinking, and emergency purposes.
Due to the flooding of the Maury
river, the Lexington water treatment
plant had to forego operations until
water could be removed from it.

Students had to forego showers,
laundry and car washing temporari-
ly, an idea some had trouble accept-
ing.

Though damage in Lexington was
limited largely to the water treat-
ment plant and scattered residences,
surrounding areas were not so for-
tunate. Business and residential
losses in Buena Vista, GlasgoW and
Goshen amounted to over $65 million,
Buena Vista alone suffered about $50
million worth of damage, mostly to
local industry.

According to Goshen mayor Anita
Tuttle, damage to the town of 350 was
considerable. ‘‘Because the center of
town is in a low-lying area, many of
the businesses and public buildings
downtown were inundated,’’ says
Tuttle.

And though only 10 families were

The Soviet Union is using the
“largest subversive mechanism in
the history of mankind” to under-
mine United States foreign and
domestic policy, said Stanislav Lev-
chenko to a_ standing-room-only
crowd in Lee Chapel last Thursday
night.

Levchenko, the highest ranking
KGB official ever to defect to the
West, said that the Soviet Union
spends $2 billion a year on “‘disinfor-
mation.’”’ According to Levechenko,
disinformation is the Soviet Union’s
effort to influence foreign decision
making, international public opinion
and foreign legislatures. They at-
tempt this through Soviet propagan-
da, such as pamphlets and speeches
by high-ranking officials, and covert
actions which are considerably more
dangerous, yet not easily traced to
the Soviet government.

Levchenko himself said he was in-
volved in such covert actions as a
KGB agent stationed in Japan under

the guise of Bureau Chief of Soviet In-
ternational Affairs Weekly Magazine
“New Times.’’ Levchenko told the
crowd that he used gloves to handle
forged letters sent to public figures
and journalists in Japan and the Far
East to avoid having the letters trac-
ed through the fingerprints.

The Soviets have become experts
at forgeries, said Levchenko, but
sometimes they become careless, He
asserted that during the 1984 Sum-
mer Olympic Games in Los Angeles,
the KGB sent forged threatening let-
ters from the Ku Klux Klan to some
Third World countries. The letters
were obviously forgeries, said Lev-
chenko, for several reasons. There is
no nationwide organization known
solely as the Ku Klux Klan, the let-
ters contained many grammatical
errors in the English language and
all of the letters were postmarked
from the Maryland suburbs
surrounding Washington D.C.

The KGB can even forge CIA
documents because they have access
to almost every form of stationery
and letterhead that exists, according

Agent reveals KGB acts

to Levchenko.

This “‘silent war of disinformation”
is impossible to stop, said Lev-
chenko, but it is possible to slow
down. The American people must
broaden their awareness, said
Levechenko and become less naive
and vulnerable to the KGB’s mani-
pulative covert actions. He also call-
ed for “expelling all perpertrators of
Soviet disinformation from the
United States’’ to help disrupt such
covert actions.

Levchenko defected from the
Soviet Union in October 1979, soon
after his promotion to the rank of Ma-
jor in the KGB and was appointed as
Chief of the Active Measures Group
of the Tokyo Residency of the KGB.
He told the audience that his decision
to defect had taken him almost 20
years to make. Levchenko said he
had several chances to defect before
actually doing so. A dislike for the
“Soviet system” existed for many
years, but he did not want to defect
until deciding to work against the ef-
forts of the Soviet Union and the
KGB.

OPINION

The Ring-tum Phi, November 6, 1986

 

Faustus U.?

In the November 10 issue of Time magazine, the article
‘‘What Is College For?’’ discusses the motives of students at-
tending college today. According to a study done by the
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, most
current high school students and their parents believe the
primary goal of college is to get a well paying job, rather
than to learn.

A sample of the statistics quoted in the article include the
University of Illinois report that “only 19% of its humanities
students have guarenteed jobs upon graduation, vs. 90% for
business majors.” According to U.S. Government statistics
quoted in the article, bachelors degrees in business have
risen from 114,865 in 1971 to 230,031 in 1984, and B.A.s in
English and literature have declined from 57,026 in 1971 to
26,419 in 1984.

It appears that the desire to make money and get ahead
has overpowered the pursuit of higher intellect. Some may
Say the concern for fellow mankind is dead, and that most
‘pre-med or pre-law students are only out for the high income
bracket. Is this a valid assessment?

It is to a degree. Students must be realistic. They know in
what sort of lifestyle or environment they want to live, and
they also realize what sort of career they must obtain to
reach their goal.

The pursuit of a career has its limitations when it serves as
an all consuming vacuum. Many business majors hate their
C-school classes. They complain that because a business ma-
jor is so regimented they cannot fit in the philosophy course
or English lit course that they would like to take. If this is the
case, then yes, the pursuit of an academic major for the sake
of income is bad. However, thé majority of business majors
have some sort of interest in their major beyond the money it
will bring them.

Many concerns with students attending college only for a
career are solved in the system of liberal education. Students
get the technical training for the career they want to pursue,
as well as courses in other disciplines.

Certainly, many schools are becoming more business and
professionally oriented, and this trend is likely to continue
until high paying jobs for English and Philosophy majors
become more readily available. Because so many people are
majoring in business, pre-med, and pre-law, there will un-
doubtably be a shortage of teachers. Because of the increase
in demand, perhaps salaries for teachers will rise and people
will again pursue these majors.

Until then, students should evaluate why they are at W&L
and realize that for some this is the last opportunity they
have to explore interests outside their intended career.

Reprieve

As Parents’ Weekend approaches, students at Washington
and Lee have a tendency to examine their academic stand-
ing. Many have reached the point of being ‘‘out of gas’’;
burnt out also describes the situation. It is possible that
students need a rest.

The upcoming Thanksgiving break, eagerly awaited by
students, is a prime reason for not having an official fall
break. While it is a reason, it is not reasonable.

The break comes too late in the term to allow students a
needed rest from classes. Unlike the winter and spring
terms, there is no break after six weeks of classes. Instead,
the break comes after ten weeks of classes. Everyone knows
that a W&L, four weeks of classes adds up to a large amount
of work.

Thanksgiving ends up being a week of work away from
school. Students write term papers, read assigned books and
basically attempt to catch up before final exams. This large
amount of work takes a lot away from a holiday when one
should be with family and friends.

A break after the sixth week of fall term would benefit
everyone. Coming earlier in the term, it would help avoid stu-
dent burn-out, which only hurts one’s academic standing.
With mid-terms out of the way and exams not yet in sight, the
work load over break would not be as heavy as it is over
Thanksgiving break.

Shortening the Thanksgiving break would be a feasible
solution to working in the time for a fall break except that a
shorter break would make it harder for some students to get
home for the holiday. A better solution would be to start
freshman orientation and classes one week earlier, which
would put the university on a schedule similar to most other
colleges and universities in the country.

A motion was passed Tuesday by the Interfraternity
Council that will allow the Ring-tum Phi to cover portions
of its meetings. The Phi hopes to cover the meetings as

fairly and accurately as possible, and avoid any problems
in the future.

Do you ever wonder why W&L
doesn’t switch Parents’ Weekend
and Homecoming so our folks
could see us halfway between the
start of school and Thanksgiving?

The reason, according to
Associate Development Director
Carter McNeese, is because it is
important to have Parents’ Week-
end after freshman mid-term
grades have been released. Lucky
freshmen, almost makes you not
want to be one.

Freshman mid-terms have a
habit of making parents about as
welcome as in-laws. Or maybe
outlaws. That’s why I think there
is actually a second cause, what I
refer to as “THE NAME-DROP-
BIRD-DROP-POPULARITY
PRINCIPLE.”

Have you every noticed how
popular people suddenly become
during Parents’ Weekend? If you
haven’t, you’re probably a fresh-
man. And although your mid-
terms may belie it, you’re also
smart enough to impress your
parents with your popularity by

 

LEXICON

dropping names faster than birds
drop droppings or droplets.

Of course, you won’t tell your
momma how superficial your re-
lationships are with most of these
people, a complex and time-con-
suming problem. So to help you
out in this and other people-
related predicaments, I’m pro-
ducing the ‘Lexicongrapher’s
Guide To Friendship, Love and
The Like, If You Please.”

Here’s the Parents’ Weekend
section. Simply use the numbers
and or letters to describe your
relationships.

“Mom, Dad, this is (name).
He/she is:

1) A ‘real’ friend, the kind who
would give me mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation even if I stopped
breathing while eating a Lloyds’
burger with onions.

2) An ‘average’ friend (please
use letters for specificity) a) is for
automobile, which he/she posses-
ses; b) is for beer, which he/she is
old enough to purchase for me; c)
is for cash, of which he/she has an

overabundance.

3) A mooch, and is using me
because I am a 2a, 2b or 2c (see
above).

4) A fraternity brother whose
name and vital statistics I had to
memorize at the risk of hazing
(What? Not here at W&L.)

5) Wearing a nametag.

6) My dorm counselor, and
he/she a) loves me; b) hates me;
c) has no idea who I am.

7) Called on in class every day
by the professor. I always address
him/her as Mr./Ms., because
that’s how the professor does it,
and I don’t know his/her first
name.

8) The one who kissed my hand
and shook my baby while running
for class office.

9) Just a person whose name I
know. (Beatles fans, note the
significance of this being the most
judicious and, therefore, the most
common of answers. )

10) Your Mama? Well how do
you do? I’m very pleased to meet
Vet.

 

 

 

 

Freshman agrees with Jones’ My View

To the Editors:

It is an accepted fact that incoming freshmen
are inherently slow on the uptake and, regret-
ably, I am no exception. Nevertheless, I have
managed to stumble upon what seems to be the
consensus on campus. Nobody, and I mean
nobody, likes the Ring-tum Phi. Doesn’t this
bother you, the people most responsible for the
Phi? It should. In fact, it should bother you so as
to compel you to heed Abb Jones’ advice and
seek a faculty advisor. In order to properly
report information to the public (or, in this case,
the student body) the Fourth Estate must first
earn the confidence of the public. In the case of
the Phi, this confidence simply does not exist.
Admittedly, my high school newspaper wasn’t

 

LETTERS

much, but one problem we did not have was an
avalanche of public disapproval.

Do not mistake me, the Phi is far from a lost
cause. The fact that you ran Abb Jones’ article
proves that the Phi does have the rare ability to
criticize itself. Unfortunately, it also seems to
have the not-so-rare ability to be hypocritical.
Nowhere is this more apparent than in your end-
less feud with the fraternities. Nobody's reputa-
tion or credibility stands to gain in this war of
words. This may come as a bit of a shock, but
fraternities do not represent Nazism, Fascism,
or the Ku Klux Klan. So why don’t you call off the

witch hunt?

As W&L’s only school newspaper, the Phi has a
huge responsibility. Obtaining a faculty advisor

would go a long way toward, at last, fulfilling
that responsibility.

Student questions grammar

To the editors:
I read Christopher B. Saxman’s letter in last
week’s issue. Nice grammar.

MY VIEW

By Chris Carter

 

i

The scene had all the emotion and,
drama of an Academy Award win-
ning movie. I could hear the two well-
wishers as they said goodbye to their
friend John and wished him a safe
journey. A third friend walked by
and, when told where John was go- '
ing, sadly made the Sign of the Cross ,
over him as she said, ‘‘Oh, you foolish
idealist, you!’’ With the final com- *
ment on who was to receive his col- ,
lection of party tapes and (empty)
beer cans, John bid his friends’
farwell. ‘‘If I don’t make it,’’ he said, «
“tell my folks I loved them and I’m ,
overdrawn at the bank again.” No,
John wasn’t boarding the ship to go '
be a missionary to the cannibals in «
darkest South Dakota; he was engag-
ed in a far more risky proposition, he
was boarding the elevator — to go
down into the bowels of the Universi-
ty Library for some studying. It was
surely a sign of great courage that
one so young should make such a
valiant gesture for the sake of Mom,
Apple Pie and the GPA. t

Perhaps you were unaware of it, |
but W&L recently made the ‘‘Guin-
ness Book of World Records”
— though not for anything as mun-
dane as high board scores for enter-
ing freshmen, or job and graduate —
school placement. No, we got a spot ‘
for having the only elevators in cap- «
tivity which break down more often ,
than British sports cars. In my three
and a half years here at W&L, I can’t
remember that both the elevators in |
the Library have ever worked at the
same time for longer than two weeks ‘
— and then usually over Christmas «
Break! There are probably people .
here who have spent as much time ,
waiting on one crowded elevator
moving at a snail’s pace as they have ©
spent actually studying — though it’s «
possible that this says more about
their study habits than the elevators.

You have to wonder sometimes
about the priorities around here. I
mean, we spend over a million dol- *
lars to fix up a house so nice that one +
hesitates to breathe in it for fear of .
disturbing the antique dust for guests
who will be here for only a night or
two, but we can’t (won’t bother to)
find the money to keep machines ‘
which are used by well over a thou- ¢
sand people several times a day in .
working order.

Actually, I’m of the opinion that the
Library, though it’s less than ten *
years old, is haunted. (Yes, I know ;
Halloween is over, but this really
isn’t going to be a ghost story). Con-
sider the heating in there. During the ‘
Spring Term one has two choices:
pneumonia induced by stepping into
the Sub-Zero library temperatures,
or trudging around in 85 degree heat
with a wool sweater under your arn.
in case you have to enter the igloo. In
the winter, on the other hand, it’s a
sauna in there in which boxers and
bikinis are de rigueur. Then there are,
those weird urinals. Ever notice, |
guys, how they sometimes start up ©
without anyone’s flushing them, and
then they won’t cut off? That water
fountain on Lower Level One some-
times does the same kind of thing. As
I say, there must be a ghost that
causes all these crazy things.

But ghost or no ghost, these things
are trivial when compared to those

+ dangerous elevators. A fellow could.
starve while the folks of B and G try
to figure out how to get you out — and
what if you have to go to the bath-
room?? I found out later that John
did make it down to his carrel, but
when you think of all the tension he
went through just to get there, could
anyone really be surprised that he
failed his mid-term the next day? I
think that until the elevators get fix-
ed, all students should get an extra .5
added to our GPA’s just for the stress
we go through. The faculty probably
wouldn’t like doing this, but there is, ,
of course, another solution...

'Mock Convention prepares
for the 1988 meeting

 

By GENIENNE MONGNO
Staff Reporter

 

Just as the 1986 elections end,
students at Washington and Lee are
already gearing up for 1988. It began
last Thursday with the first organiza-
tional meeting of the Mock Demo-
cratic Convention. About 70 to 80 en-
thusiastic newcomers attended hop-
ing to be able to contribute in some
way.

Co-chairman, Lester Coe, said that
he was “‘pleased on a whole”’ with the
turnout. He also noted that although
a lot of people did not show up
because of previous commitments,
he has been approached by many

Professor Emory Kimbrough,
head of the Department of Sociology,
was forced to leave his position at the
University due to illness but is ex-
pected to return winter term.

The nature of the illness was not
disclosed.

John Elrod, dean of the college,
said, ‘Emory Kimbrough is on sick
leave for the remainder of this term.
The three courses that he was teach-
ing this term will be picked up and
followed through to the end of the

students eager to help out.

The convention has been a tradi-
tion at W&L since 1908. Occuring
every four years when student
delegates gather, they try to pre-
dict the presidential candidate
from the political party currently out
of power. Although the W&L conven-
tion is not the oldest of its kind, it has
a reputation for accuracy and au-
thenticity. The convention has
chosen the correct candidate 13 out of
18 times, and has only been wrong
once since 1948.

However, the convention has not
earned its reputation by haphazard
guessing. It is a result of intensive
research that takes place far in ad-

sick leave

term by Miss Camille Miller. She’s a
doctoral candidate in sociology at the
University of Virginia and a resident
of Lexington.”

Kimbrough had been teaching
courses this term in ‘‘The City,”
“Population” and ‘‘Social Theory.”
He also teaches general sociology,
American sociology, current issues
in sociology, and organization
theory.

Professor Kimbrough has taught at
W&L since 1962. He became depart-
ment head in 1967. Kimbrough re-
ceived his M.A. and Ph.D. in soc-
iology from the University of North
Carolina.

vance of the convention date. Ques-
tionnaires are sent out, and each
state’s party organizations are can-
vassed to find out their presidential
preference. When this is completed,
the Mock Convention’s state chair-
men and regional coordinatiors eval-
uate the data and predictions are
made.

It is because of all the hard work
needed to make the convention, that
so much help is needed to put it
together. There are high hopes for
the 1988 convention, but what is real-
ly needed right now are dedicated
people who are willing to devote their
time to ensure that the convention
will be the best it can be.

By PETER BOATNER
Staff Reporter

 

Mid-term grades for the class of
| 1990 were at about the same level as
| last year’s freshmen class, which is

to say at a level unprecedented in 15
years.

The average freshmen mid-term
grade point average was 2.449, down
from last year’s 2.451.

Dean of Freshmen H. Robert
Huntley called this difference ‘“‘in-
Significant.”

Huntley said the mid-terms from
this year and last are easily the best
since 1973, as far back as he had
records.

This year’s junior class, for in-
stance, had a fall mid-term average
of 2.151 as freshmen.

Leading the class with a 4.094, was
a woman, and of the top five aver-
ages, three belonged to women.

The most significant figure drawn
from the grades, Huntley said, was
the small number of freshmen with
averages below 1.5.

This year, only 32 freshmen had
mid-terms below the 1.5 level.

Thirty-seven of last year’s
freshmen were below that level at
this time last year.

“Tf the freshmen keep this up, they
can phase the Dean of Freshmen
out,” Huntley said.

He also noted the dorms have suf-
fered much less damage this year
than in the past, and that the
freshmen seem to be drinking a lot
less in the dorms.

Foundation wants
college changes

 

From the New York Times

 

NEW YORK — The Carnegie Foundation for the Ad-
vancement of Teaching called Saturday for an overhaul
of undergraduate education, including the dropping of
standardized admission tests as a requirement at most
colleges and universities.

A 242-page report by the foundation, portraying the
undergraduate college as a ‘“‘troubled institution,’’ was
sharply critical of the quality of instruction. It found that
the prevailing doctrine that a professor must publish
scholarly treatises to succeed was pushing many into
research when they would rather be teaching.

The study called on colleges to fight overspecialization
by students and require upperclassmen to take seminars
in which the ‘“‘social and ethical’ aspects of their major

field would be explored. It cited what it saw as tensions
between “‘careerism and the liberal arts.”

The report, entitled ‘‘College: The Undergraduate Ex-
perience in America,”’ is the most systematic study ever
done of four-year colleges. The three-year, $1 million pro-
ject involved surveys of 5,000 faculty members, 5,000
undergraduates, 1,000 college administrators, 1,000 high
school students and 1,000 parents.

Ernest L. Boyer, president of the foundation, wrote in
the report, ‘‘The American college is ready for renewal
and there is, we believe, an urgency to the task.”

In making the proposal on admission tests, one of 83
major recommendations, the report characterized as a
‘‘facade”’ the assertion that admission to a college was ‘‘a
victory hard to win.”

The researchers estimated that there were ‘‘probably
fewer than 50 colleges and universities in the United
States today that can be considered highly selective, ad-
mitting less than half the students who apply.” At least
one-third of American colleges, the report said, ‘‘are vir-
tually open-door.”’

Researchers discovered that although students felt
great pressure to perform well on the Scholastic Aptitude
Test and in the American College Testing Program, the
overwhelming majority of colleges based admission deci-
sions instead on grades in high school, involvement in
outside activities and essays included with applications.

Boyer wrote: ‘‘We asked admissions directors how last
year’s freshman class would have differed if there had
been no SAT’s or ACT scores available for consideration.
Sixty-two percent said the absence of such scores would
have made little or no difference in either the size or the
composition of the class.

“The vast majority of students and colleges do not need
a numerical matchmaker.”

George Hanford, president of the College Board, which
sponsors the Scholastic Aptitude Test, said, however,
that Boyer “doesn’t seem to fully comprehend the uses’’
of the examination. ‘It provides a common currency,
even for colleges that are not selective, and is used by
students in deciding which colleges to apply to,” he said.

_ negie Foundation’s resport is the latest in a
serics . American education that have appeared over
the last three years.

‘A Nation at Risk,”’ published in April 1983 by the Na-
tional Commission on Excellence in Education, cited a
“rising tide of mediocrity” in public schools and helped
prompt state legislatures in most states to take steps to
improve education. Five months later the Carnegie
Foundation issued a report titled “‘High School: A Report
on Secondary education in America.”’ It urged significant
changes in secondary schools, beginning with tightened
curriculums and the improvement of salaries and work-
ing conditions for teachers.

“College’’ will be published early next year by Harper
& Row; the price has tentatively been set at $19.95.

Orders can be placed by calling 212-207-7065 or
800-638-3030.

INTENTIONAL SECOND EXPOSURE

OPINION

The Ring-tum Phi, November 6, 1986

 

Faustus U.?

In the November 10 issue of Time magazine, the article
‘What Is College For?” discusses the motives of students at-
tending college today. According to a study done by the
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, most
current high school students and their parents believe the
primary goal of college is to get a well paying job, rather
than to learn.

A sample of the statistics quoted in the article include the
University of Illinois report that ‘‘only 19% of its humanities
students have guarenteed jobs upon graduation, vs. 90% for
business majors.’’ According to U.S. Government statistics
quoted in the article, bachelors degrees in business have
risen from 114,865 in 1971 to 230,031 in 1984, and B.A:s in
English and literature have declined from 57,026 in 1971 to
26,419 in 1984.

It appears that the desire to make money and get ahead
has overpowered the pursuit of higher intellect. Some may
say the concern for fellow mankind is dead, and that most
‘pre-med or pre-law students are only out for the high income
bracket. Is this a valid assessment?

It is to a degree. Students must be realistic. They know in
what sort of lifestyle or environment they want to live, and
they also realize what sort of career they must obtain to
reach their goal.

The pursuit of a career has its limitations when it serves as
an all consuming vacuum. Many business majors hate their
C-school classes. They complain that because a business ma-
jor is so regimented they cannot fit in the philosophy course
or English lit course that they would like to take. If this is the
case, then yes, the pursuit of an academic major for the sake
of income is bad. However, thé majority of business majors
have some sort of interest in their major beyond the money it
will bring them.

Many concerns with students attending college only for a
career are solved in the system of liberal education. Students
get the technical training for the career they want to pursue,
as well as courses in other disciplines.

Certainly, many schools are becoming more business and

' professionally oriented, and this trend is likely to continue
. until high paying jobs for English and Philosophy majors
~ become more readily available. Because so many people are
- majoring in business, pre-med, and pre-law, there will un-
doubtably be a shortage of teachers. Because of the increase
in demand, perhaps salaries for teachers will rise and people
will again pursue these majors.
' Until then, students should evaluate why they are at W&L
' and realize that for some this is the last opportunity they
. have to explore interests outside their intended career.

Reprieve

. As Parents’ Weekend approaches, students at Washington

- and Lee have a tendency to examine their academic stand-
ing. Many have reached the point of being ‘‘out of gas’’;

' burnt out also describes the situation. It is possible that
students need a rest.

The upcoming Thanksgiving break, eagerly awaited by
students, is a prime reason for not having an official fall
break. While it is a reason, it is not reasonable.

The break comes too late in the term to allow students a
needed rest from classes. Unlike the winter and spring
terms, there is no break after six weeks of classes. Instead,
the break comes after ten weeks of classes. Everyone knows
that a W&L, four weeks of classes adds up to a large amount

of work.

Thanksgiving ends up being a week of work away from
school. Students write term papers, read assigned books and
basically attempt to catch up before final exams. This large
amount of work takes a lot away from a holiday when one
should be with family and friends.

A break after the sixth week of fall term would benefit
everyone. Coming earlier in the term, it would help avoid stu-
dent burn-out, which only hurts one’s academic standing.
With mid-terms out of the way and exams not yet in sight, the
work load over break would not be as heavy as it is over
Thanksgiving break.

Shortening the Thanksgiving break would be a feasible
solution to working in the time for a fall break except that a
shorter break would make it harder for some students to get
home for the holiday. A better solution would be to start
freshman orientation and classes one week earlier, which
would put the university on a schedule similar to most other
colleges and universities in the country.

A motion was passed Tuesday by the Interfraternity
Council that will allow the Ring-tum Phi to cover portions
of its meetings. The Phi hopes to cover the meetings as

fairly and accurately as possible, and avoid any problems
in the future.

MY VIEW '
By Chris Carter

 

The scene had all the emotion and,

ning movie. I could hear the two well-’
wishers as they said goodbye to their ,
friend John and wished him a safe
journey. A third friend walked by
and, when told where John was go-*
ing, sadly made the Sign of the Cross ,
over him as she said, ‘‘Oh, you foolish
idealist, you!” With the final com- ‘
ment on who was to receive his col- ,
lection of party tapes and (empty)
beer cans, John bid his friends '
farwell. ‘‘If I don’t make it,”’ he said, «
“tell my folks I loved them and I'm ,
overdrawn at the bank again.’’ No,
John wasn’t boarding the ship to go '
be a missionary to the cannibals in «
darkest South Dakota; he was engag- |
ed in a far more risky proposition, he
was boarding the elevator — to go ‘
down into the bowels of the Universi- +
ty Library for some studying. It was
surely a sign of great courage that
one so young should make such a
valiant gesture for the sake of Mom,
Apple Pie and the GPA. ‘
Perhaps you were unaware of it,
but W&L recently made the “Guin-
ness Book of World Records”
— though not for anything as mun-
dane as high board scores for enter-
ing freshmen, or job and graduate
school placement. No, we got a spot
for having the only elevators in cap-
tivity which break down more often
than British sports cars. In my three
and a half years here at W&L, I can't
remember that both the elevators in
the Library have ever worked at the
same time for longer than two weeks
— and then usually over Christmas
Break! There are probably people
here who have spent as much time
waiting on one crowded elevator
moving at a snail’s pace as they have
spent actually studying — though it’s
possible that this says more about
their study habits than the elevators.
You have to wonder sometimes
about the priorities around here. I
mean, we spend over a million dol-
lars to fix up a house so nice that one
hesitates to breathe in it for fear of
disturbing the antique dust for guests

LETTERS
Freshman agrees with Jones’ My View

To the Editors:

It is an accepted fact that incoming freshmen
are inherently slow on the uptake and, regret-
ably, I am no exception. Nevertheless, I have
managed to stumble upon what seems to be the
consensus on campus. Nobody, and I mean
nobody, likes the Ring-tum Phi. Doesn’t this
bother you, the people most responsible for the
Phi? It should. In fact, it should bother you so as
to compel you to heed Abb Jones’ advice and
seek a faculty advisor. In order to properly
report information to the public (or, in this case,
the student body) the Fourth Estate must first
earn the confidence of the public. In the case of
the Phi, this confidence simply does not exist.
Admittedly, my high school newspaper wasn’t

much, but one problem we did not have was an
avalanche of public disapproval.

Do not mistake me, the Phi is far from a lost
cause. The fact that you ran Abb Jones’ article
proves that the Phi does have the rare ability to
criticize itself. Unfortunately, it also seems to
have the not-so-rare ability to be hypocritical.
Nowhere is this more apparent than in your end-
less feud with the fraternities. Nobody's reputa-
tion or credibility stands to gain in this war of
words, This may come as a bit of a shock, but
fraternities do not represent Nazism, Fascism,
or the Ku Klux Klan. So why don't you call off the

witch hunt?

As W&L’s only school newspaper, the Phi has a
huge responsibility. Obtaining a faculty advisor

would go a long way toward, at last, fulfilling
that responsibility.

University due to illness but is ex-

The nature of the illness was not
disclosed.

John Elrod, dean of the college,
said, “‘Emory Kimbrough is on sick

The convention has been a tradi-

every four years when student
delegates gather, they try to pre-
dict the presidential candidate

of power. Although the W&L conven-
tion is not the oldest of its kind, it has
a reputation for accuracy and au-
thenticity. The convention has
chosen the correct candidate 13 out of
18 times, and has only been wrong
once since 1948.

earned its reputation by haphazard
guessing. It is a result of intensive

Frosh midterms are high

 

By PETER BOATNER
Staff Reporter

 

Mid-term grades for the class of
1990 were at about the same level as
last year’s freshmen class, which is
to say at a level unprecedented in 15
years.

The average freshmen mid-term
grade point average was 2.449, down
from last year’s 2.451.

Dean of Freshmen H. Robert
Huntley called this difference ‘‘in-
significant.”

Huntley said the mid-terms from
this year and last are easily the best
since 1973, as far back as he had
records.

This year’s junior class, for in-
stance, had a fall mid-term average
of 2.151 as freshmen.

Leading the class with a 4.094, was
a woman, and of the top five aver-
ages, three belonged to women.

The most significant figure drawn
from the grades, Huntley said, was
the small number of freshmen with
averages below 1.5.

This year, only 32 freshmen had
mid-terms below the 1.5 level.

Thirty-seven of last year’s
freshmen were below that level at
this time last year.

sharply critical of the quality of instruction. It found that
the prevailing doctrine that a professor must publish
scholarly treatises to succeed was pushing many into
research when they would rather be teaching.

The study called on colleges to fight overspecialization
by students and require upperclassmen to take seminars
in which the ‘‘social and ethical” aspects of their major

field would be explored. It cited what it saw as tensions
between “careerism and the liberal arts.”

The report, entitled ‘“‘College: The Undergraduate Ex-
perience in America,” is the most systematic study ever
done of four-year colleges. The three-year, $1 million pro-
ject involved surveys of 5,000 faculty members, 5,000
undergraduates, 1,000 college administrators, 1,000 high
school students and 1,000 parents.

Ernest L. Boyer, president of the foundation, wrote in
the report, ‘“‘The American college is ready for renewal
and there is, we believe, an urgency to the task.”

In making the proposal on admission tests, one of 83
major recommendations, the report characterized as a
“facade” the assertion that admission to a college was ‘“‘a
victory hard to win.”’

The researchers estimated that there were “probably
fewer than 50 colleges and universities in the United
States today that can be considered highly selective, ad-
mitting less than half the students who apply.”’ At least
one-third of American colleges, the report said, ‘‘are vir-
tually open-door.”’

great pressure to perform well on the Scholastic Aptitude
Test and in the American College Testing Program, the
overwhelming majority of colleges based admission deci-
sions instead on grades in high school, involvement in
outside activities and essays included with applications.

Boyer wrote: ‘‘We asked admissions directors how last |
year’s freshman class would have differed if there had i
been no SAT’s or ACT scores available for consideration. |
Sixty-two percent said the absence of such scores would |
have made little or no difference in either the size or the

composition of the class.

“The vast majority of students and colleges do not need i
a numerical matchmaker.”

George Hanford, president of the College Board, which
sponsors the Scholastic Aptitude Test, said, however,
that Boyer “doesn’t seem to fully comprehend the uses”’
of the examination. “It provides a common currency,
even for colleges that are not selective, and is used by
students in deciding which colleges to apply to,’’ he said.

“‘A Nation at Risk,” published in April 1983 by the Na-
tional Commission on Excellence in Education, cited a
“rising tide of mediocrity” in public schools and helped
prompt state legislatures in most states to take steps to |
improve education. Five months later the Carnegie
Foundation issued a report titled ‘High School: A Report
on Secondary education in America.” It urged significant
changes in secondary schools, beginning with tightened
curriculums and the improvement of salaries and work-
ing conditions for teachers.

Webb to speak at VMI

 

STAFF REPORTS

 

James H. Webb, Jr., assistant
secretary of defense for reserve af-

Virginia Military Institute’s
Founders Day Convocation on Tues-
day, Nov. 11.

A celebrated author and lecturer,
and winner of an Emmy Award for
his coverage of the Marines in
Beirut, Webb has served as a first
assistant secretary to Casper
Weinberger since his confirmation
by the Senate in April 1984.

The convocation, in VMI’s

Since Webb’s position in the
Department of Defense is concerned
with Reserve affairs, he might be
considered the most appropriate
speaker possible for VMI. A vast ma-
jority of VMI graduates receive
reserve commissions in all four
branches of the armed forces.

Webb’s first novel, Fields of Fire,
1978, whose topic was ground combat
in Vietnam, was nominated for a Pu-
litzer Prize and was a finalist in the
Hemingway competition for out-
standing first novels. His book, “‘A

for excellence in legal writing there.

Before being named an sssistant

severely affected by the flood in
terms of private property loss, Tuttle
comments that “in a town of 350,
even 10 families suffering loss is a
proportionally high number.”’

The immediate effects of the flood
were great, says Tuttle. ‘“Because
telephone service was cut off, our
priority at the time was obtaining
some means of communication. Peo-
ple needing to get in touch with
relatives found it very difficult to do
so.’’ Fortunately, local radio
operators were able to provide much
of the needed communication in the
first few days.

Afterwards, the largest problem
was finding housing and food for
families whose houses were damag-
ed or destroyed during the flood. ‘‘We
were relatively lucky in helping those
families. Goshen is a very close-knit
community, so finding temporary
housing for those families was not
difficult,”’ according to Tuttle.

Goshen Pass, the scenic 1/2 mile
drive which provides the only access
by car to Goshen, was damaged by
two mudslides, causing it to be wash-
ed out in two places and resulting in
approximately $1 million in damage.
The road was closed during the
spring so that repairs could be made.

covered up,’’ says Craig Smith, a
W&L junior and resident of Buena
Vista. Though Smith says his house
was undamaged, houses lower in the
valley were not so fortunate, being
below the water level of the Maury
river. Those above the river faced
the possibility of flooding from small
streams emptying into the river from
the Blue Ridge Mountains.

Damage to industry was perhaps
the greatest blow to the town.
According to Foster, the Rea Magnet
Wire Company and Reeves Brothers
Plant, two of Buena Vista’s largest
employers, are in the process of
relocating due to the flood. Lying on
the Maury river, both businesses sus-
tained damages in the millions of
dollars. But flood losses did not
prompt the businesses to relocate

“Due to the lack of adequate flood
insurance,” says Wilford Ramsey, a
local realtor, ‘‘businesses can onlv be
insured up to $250,000 for flood loss.
Insurance companies are unwilling
to offer the larger companies flood
insurance, making it hard for com-
panies like these to cover their losses
when they become too high,”’

Fortunately, volunteer efforts
after the flood enabled residents to
begin cleanup almost immediately.

Preparing for parents

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Assignments Editor

If you think the guy down the hall’s
a real ‘‘momma’s boy,” or if you’ve
ever wondered what kind of car the
parent of a Porsche-driving college
student owns, this may be the
weekend to find out.

About 1,200 parents of Washington
and Lee University students are ex-
pected to be in Lexington this
weekend for W&L’s 32nd annual
Parents’ Weekend. The purpose of
this event is to give parents a chance
to visit their children and learn more
about W&L, said Carter McNeese,
the school’s associate director of
development.

“The one thing I hope is different
from last year is that we don’t have
another flood,’’ he said.

Although McNeese was only joking
when he referred to the deluge that
devastated Western and Central
Virginia last Election Day, parents
and their kids could be in for a rather
soggy weekend. As of Wednesday

night, the Associated Press’ extend-
ed forecast for the state called for a
daily chance of rain Friday through
Saturday. Highs should be in the mid
50s to the mid 60s, with lows in the
40s.

McNeese, who is coordinating his
15th Parents’ Weekend, said the only
addition to this year’s program was
an open house for freshmen, law
students and their parents at the
home of President and Mrs. John D.
Wilson on Saturday afternoon.
Wilson’s house was built by Robert
E. Lee in 1867.

Lee Chapel will be filled with the
sounds of music during an 8 p.m.
vocal and instrumental concert.
President and Mrs. John D. Wilson
then will serve as hosts for an infor-
mal reception in the Evans Dining
Hall.

Panel discussions with faculty, ad-
ministrators and students will be
held Saturday morning from 9 to 11,
followed by Wilson’s report to the
parents at 11:30 in the chapel. A

luncheon in the dining hall will last
from 12:15 to 1:15 p.m. The cost for
adults is $6.50 or 4% points for point-
card holders.

In athletic action, W&L’s grueling
8,000 meter crosscountry course will
be the site of the men’s and women’s
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
cross-country championships, at
11:30 a.m. and noon, respectively.
The football Generals will take on Ur-
sinus at 1:30 on Wilson Field.

About two-thirds of the parents
who signed up for this year’s
Parents’ Weekend have sons or
daughters who are freshmen or
sophomores, McNeese said. The
numbers are split pretty evenly be-
tween the two classes.

Although the main funciton of the
development office is to raise money,
McNeese stressed that fund raising
was in no way the purpose of
Parents’ Weekend.

Students hurting for cash, how-
ever, just might disagree.

Preparing for travel

By CHRISTIE CHAMPLIN

Staff Reporter

As Thanksgiving and Christmas
vacations approach us, students who
have not already done so must begin
to schedule travel arrangements as
soon as possible. There are two
travel agencies in Lexington which
can help students make reserva-
tions: Herring Travel and Travel
Unlimited.

The decrease in competition bet-
ween the airlines, due to the large
number of mergers and acquisitions

in the airline industry, has increased
the cost of travelling by air;
however, many airlines have in-
stituted thirty day advance purchase
rates which reduce the round trip
fare, said Collins. The rates for
travel during the holiday seasons are
higher than those of the rest of the
year even though the special fares
reduce the rates 60 to 70 percent. Am-
track has introduced the All-Aboard
America Fare to the majority of its
markets. This fare provides round
trip transportation for the price of a
one-way ticket plus $7. These reser-
vations can be made anytime before
departure. Collins said, “If anyone

needs to make arrangements for
Christmas, they need to do so as soon

as possible.”’

It is still possible to make reserva-
tions for Thanksgiving, but there
could be a problem getting back by
Dec. 1 if students want to fly into
Roanoke because W&L, Virginia
Tech, Radford and Virginia Military
Institute all use the same airport,
said Collins.

To make arrangements students
can go to or call Herring Travel at
463-2197 or Travel Unlimited at
463-7174.

Soccer sets new
record; just misses

the D-Ill

By GARY McCULLOUGH
Staff Reporter

 

After starting the season with three
losses in it’s first four games, the
Washington and Lee men’s soccer
team didn’t look to be going
anywhere fast, but looks can be
deceiving.

The team pulled itself together and
won 10 of it’s last 11 games, as well as
the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
gerence title. In the process, the
team set school records for both wins
and goals in a season.

Last week the team wrapped up it’s
season with wins over Maryville and
Averett.

The Generals capped off their
record breaking season with a 4-2 vic-
tory over Averett College on Smith
Field last Monday. This gave the
team their record setting 11th win
and was an impressive finish to the
season.

On Saturday, the Generals bom-
barded the Maryville Scots with eight
goals, their highest offensive output
since the 8-0 win over the University
of the South earler this season.

The Scots could manage only a
single tally in response to W&L’s
assault and became the General’s
10th victim of the season.

The team’s final record for the 1986

playoffs

season stands at 11-4 overall and a
perfect 5-0 in the ODAC.

In light of their fast finish there was
some talk of a bid to the NCAA Divi-
sion III tournament. However, when
the tournament field was announed,
Washington and Lee was not among
the invited teams.

When asked how the team reacted
to missing the tournament, Senior co-
captain Peter Van Son, said, ‘“They
{the tournament officials] take four
teams from each region, and the
other teams were already ranked
above us. We thought we had a
chance, but we weren’t really too
disappointed.”’

Even though the General’s didn’t
make the tournament, they still had
an outstanding season. They won the
ODAC and set school records for both
wins and goals in a season.

In addition, there were several
record-setting individual perfor-
mances as well. Junior goaltender
Chris Gaeris set a school record for
career shutouts, and freshman
Patrick Brown set a new mark for
assists in a season.

In light of the team’s finish and
record setting performances head
coach Rolph Piranian was optimistic
about his team’s chances if they had
gotten a tournament berth. ‘“‘They
better be glad they didn’t give us a
bid to the tournament.”

Football follows bouncing ball to first win of the season

 

by JIM LAKE
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington & Lee football
team recorded its first win of the
year last Saturday, a 28-14 victory
over Bridgewater. The Generals, led
on offense by quarterback Jon Thorn-
ton, running back Chris Coffland, and
split-end Randy Brown, closed out
their 1986 Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference season with a 1-4 record.

“We showed intensity and ag-
gressiveness throughout the game,”
said Generals head coach Gary
Fallon. ‘“‘It was a real team effort.”

After a scoreless first period, the
Generals struck first on a 1-yard run
by Thornton with 10:30 left in the sec-
ond. Nine minutes later, the Eagles
tied the game at seven when Adrian
Mobley scored from one yard out,

and the score remained 7-7 at half-
time.

Washington and Lee started the
third period with a 90-yard touch-
down return of the opening kickoff by
Coffland, but the Generals couldn't
relax for long, as the Eagles nearly
returned the ensuing kickoff for a
score. However, the W&L defense
held, shutting out Bridgewater for
most of the quarter. Then, with two
minutes left in the period, Mobely
recorded his second 1-yard TD carry
of the afternoon, tying the game at
14.

But the Generals responded by
scoring as many points in the fourth
quarter as they did in the first three.
Only 18 seconds into the final period,
Thornton launched a 44-yard pass
deep for Bobby Wilson. The ball
bounced off of an Eagle defender, but
Wilson came down with it, putting the

Generals up for good. W&L defender

later, stalling the Eagles hopes for a
fourth quarter rally. Then, with 3:30
remaining, Coffland scored his sec-
ond touchdown of the game on an 11-
yard carry. Seconds later, W&L
defensive back Robert Rimmer ap-
peared to ice the victory with a 41-
yard interception return. But Fallon,
remembering his team’s last-second
loss to Randolph-Macon four weeks
earlier, was still not certain that the
Generals had locked up a win. While
trying to run out the clock on their
subsequent possession, the Generals
faced fourth down, and Fallon sent in
the field goal team. The Eagles were
assessed a 5-yard penalty for en-
croachment, and the additional yar-
dage gave the Generals a first down
and an opportunity to secure their

first win in seven games.

Looking at the game as a whole,
Fallon was particularly pleased with
the play of Thornton, who completed
10 of 16 passes for 127 yards, threw
for one touchdown and ran for
another, and was not intercepted.
(When) you give Jon enough time,
and he has a little bit of early suc-
cess, he just gets better. I was really
pleased with his performance,” said
Fallon.

Coffland continued the versatility
which he displayed against Sewanee,
playing three different positions and
returning kickoffs. Split-end Brown
led the Generals in receiving with 6
catches for 75 yards.

2-4-1, and Fallon called them ‘‘a very
tough opponent.” Although they are
not as big as some of the teams the
Generals have faced, Ursinus is
quick on defense with some ex-
perienced linebackers, said Fallon.
The Bears are led on offense by a
first-year starter at quarterback,
who Fallon said will throw to his
backs and tight ends as much as his
wide-outs. However, the Bears
are capable of both running and pass-
ing the ball. “Once again, our
defense is going to have its hands
full,’ predicted Fallon.

Looking at the Bears as a whole,
Fallon is reminded of Sewanee.
While Ursinus does not have any tru-
ly great individual players, they do
have several good ones “‘on both
sides of the ball.”’

“If we’re not ready, they’ll give us
more than we can handle. But if we

are ready, then we’re going to have a
good football game,” concluded
Fallon.

HASHMARKS — B.J. Sturgill, who
missed W&L’s first six games
because of a leg injury, played his
first game of the season last Satur-
day and made all four of the
General’s conversion attempts...
Tailback Kevin Weaver, who did not
practice Monday or Tuesday last
week because of a leg injury, gained.
85 yards on 28 carries against
Bridgewater. Weaver should be at
“100 percent’’ for the game against
Ursinus according to Fallon... The
Bears lost to Muhlenberg College last
Saturday, 24-18... Head coach Ster-
ling Brown has a 13-19-2 record in five
years at Ursinus... This will be the
last home game for 16 W&L seniors.
Over the past four years, the
Generals have a 20-15 record.

Spiders and zebras

combine to beat polo

 

By MATHEW HORRIDGE
Staff Reporter

 

 

In a very odd Southern League
championship game Saturday night,
the water polo team succumbed, 18-8,
to its nemesis — the University of
Richmond.

“We didn’t play very well,” head
coach Page Remillard said.

The Generals, seeded second in the
tournament, blew by Duke and
George Washington in day games
before facing No. 1-seeded Richmond
in the championship game Saturday
night.

Incompetent officiating had a ma-
jor effect on both teams and the
game, Remillard said.

“The officiating was so unprofes-
sional...the team didn’t respond
well,’’ Remillard said.

There are three ratings for water
polo officials: A, B and C, with A be-
ing the most experienced. All three
officials for Saturday night’s game
were C-rated and one’s only prior ex-
perience was a high school tourna-
ment.

There were 34 ejections — much
like hockey penalties — in the game,
17 for each team. A player fouls out
after three ejections.

Co-captain Simon Perez fouled out
in the first quarter and David Dietz
was gone before the first half ended.

“It (the officiating) was no better
for Richmond than it was for us,”
Remillard said, but the Spiders ‘‘ad-
justed to the incompetency of the of-
ficiating better than we did.”’

Two Richmond players were kick-
ed out of the game in the first half for
asking for clarification of officials’
calls.

Four minutes into the first quarter,
Dave Herbert, a George Washington
University water polo player, pushed
Remillard into the pool.

Several players and Remillard
said the incident epitomized the
“circus-like environment” of the
game.

When Remillard was pushed, the
game was tied at 2-2. At the end of the
first quarter, however, the score was
4-2 and Richmond never looked back.

“It wasn’t an 18-8 game,”’ one W&L
player said, noting that no other
W&L-Richmond game this year has
ended with a score difference greater
than three.

This week, the Generals have tried
to get Saturday’s fiasco out of their
minds to prepare for this weekend’s
Eastern Championships at the Naval
Academy in Annapolis.

W&L works for a shot against Richmond on Saturday.

Their first game is Saturday at
noon against Brown University
Brown, ranked among the top twenty
Division I teams, squeaked by W&L
earlier this season in a game that
went into double overtime, 15-12.

Remillard said he expects Brown
“to be very prepared” for Saturday’s
match-up. One benefit Brown has go-
ing into this game is that their pool,

like Navy’s, is official-sized — no
shallow end and much bigger than Cy
Twombly Pool.

“T expect to play a very, very good
game,” Remillard said.

If the Generals win against Brown,
they will face the winner of the
Bucknell-Richmond game in the sec-
ond round.

Generals place 2nd in tune up for Sat.’s ODAC’s

At a regional meet in Lynchburg
last Saturday, the Washington and
Lee men’s team placed second
among seven teams.

Emory University placed first with
40 points followed by the Generals
with 65.

The Generals were led by Scott
Rippeon who placed fourth with a
time of 26:50 for the 5.1 mile course.

Senior Ash Andrews said that the
team really didn’t expect to beat
Emory, but he was very pleased with

their performance at Lynchburg. An-
drews believes that the 5.1 mile
course was fast this year.

The course at Lynchburg is a dif-
ficult course with lots of places that
can break a runner’s speed and tem-
po, but this year it was also wet, ad-
ding to the difficulty.

Senior Ted Myers was also im-
pressed with the race Saturday.
Myers placed sixth with a time of
27:03. He feels that the competition is
much better this year, and that two
years ago, his time would have won
the conference.

At Lynchburg, the Generals beat

Cliches willnever die

Cliches and sports. The two are inexorably bound to one another.
They can no more be separated than can Laurel and Hardy, peanut
butter and jelly, the Pirates and last place. No, it would be unnatural
to tear cliches from sports, not to mention impossible.

Why, I’m sure you're asking, talk about cliches in such cosmic
terms? Well, it’s because they add a dimension to sports that would
otherwise be absent — predictability.

It is never 100% certain what the outcome of any contest will be
however, you can always be sure of what the coach will say before a
game.

Imagine this scenario: Undefeated Huge State University coached
by Dirk Armstrong has a game scheduled this weekend against the
winless Kalamazoo Institute for Left-handed Violinists coached by
Wilbur Snedeker. Certainly not a game destined to be counted among
the world’s great struggles.

While the game is not a complete lock, I’d be willing to wager that
coach Dirk Armstrong is not spending his nights worrying about
Kalmazoo’s devastating pass rush or some similar subject. But, of
course, he won’t admit it.

‘We can’t underestimate our opponent,” the coach will warn. ‘‘The
game will go to whoever wants it more.”’

Or you might read Armstrong say, ‘“‘We take the games as they
come, we won’t get caught looking past an opponent.”

On the other side of the field, the underdog’s coach, Wilbur
Snedeker, is tossing about such original statements as: ‘‘We go into
every game expecting to win, and this week is no exception,” or ‘We
expect all our players to give 110%, and if they do we have a good shot
to win,”’ or even my personal favorite, ‘‘On any given day, any team is
capable of beating any other team.”’

But don’t think that it’s only the coaches who keep a box of phrases
nearby, ready to be dusted off in the event of an interview. The
athletes themselves have quite an arrary of trite statements at their
disposal.

Take, for example, a ballplayer who bas been a bench jockey for
most of the season, Pepper McDuffy.

It’s the bottom of the 15th inning and the manager has used every
pinch hitter on his roster, except Pepper. The manager looks over at
him and growls, ‘“‘McDuffy, you hit.’’ Pepper jumps up, runs over to
the rack and chooses a bat, and heads to the plate.

You have no idea how Pepper is going to fare in his at-bat, but it’s no
mystery what he’ll say in the locker room following the game.

“I’m just happy to be contributing to the ball club,” (an athlete will
always refer to his team as a ball club, never as just a team) Pepper
might tell you that, “I know my role on the ball club and I’m happy
with it,” or he might say, “I consider myself lucky to be on this ball
club.” Uh, thanks Pepper.

This tendency towards cliches that sports figures have often creeps
into their everyday life as well.

Picture football coach Sam Bullock at the dinner table. First, his
wife brings out a plate of lima beans, then a steak, followed by rice
pudding for dessert. When his wife asks how he enjoyed the meal
coach Bullock says, ‘Well honey, when you brought out those beans it
looked like fourth and long to me, but you showed a lot of character by
serving that steak, and it was certainly the turning point in the meal.
After that, you came up with the big play and the rice pudding was a
big score.”’

People have come to expect these types of cliches from sports
figures, and if they don’t deliver, it’s quite a shock. Imagine your sur-
prise if Wilbur Snedeker from the Kalamazoo Institute had said,
“Yeah, there’s no way we can beat Huge State U., we’re just in it for
the payday....”’

By CHRIS CARTER
Drama Critic

 

If, as eighteenth century writers
believed, the purpose of literature is
to delight and to instruct, then in the
play Roscius, produced by the
University Theatre and running
through tomorrow night, we have an
ideal play. Written by Rose Gordon
and directed by Professor Al Gordon
of the W&L Drama Department,
‘‘Roscius”’ employs a host of ex-
cellent actors in a fascinating plot,
making for a thoroughly enjoyable
evening.

The play is about the great eigh-
teenth century actor and playwright,
David Garrick, who was nicknamed
Roscius by theatre-goers of his time
after the greatest actor of the Roman
Empire. The setting is the eve of Gar-
rick’s last performance as he reflects
upon what he has accomplished in his
life and on the factors which have
motivated him in his accomplish-
ments. Gordon has attempted here to
show how Garrick’s financial success
and desire to be accepted in the up-
per classes of society made him an
outcast in the “family of theatre.”
Thus, we see scenes from both the
public and private sides of Garrick’s
life and from the earlier and later
periods of his career.

The reflective nature of the plot
allows Ms. Gordon to play some in-
teresting games. Throughout much
of the play, an ‘‘audience’’ sits on
stage. When scenes from eighteenth
century theatre are being acted, the
audience makes the comments which
eighteenth century audiences would
have made and is, in effect, histori-
cally real. In other episodes from
Garrick’s private life, and in the
reflective scenes, the audience to the
drama of Garrick’s life acts as a sort
of conscience for him. The devise,
though hardly unique, is better
employed than is often the case and
is highly effective.

But more than such boring
academic points as plot or structure,
what makes ‘‘Roscius’”’ work is the
amazingly high level of acting which
almost every member of the cast
maintains. The lead is played by pro-
fessional Paul Norwood, an alumnus
of 1973. Mr. Norwood’s three years in
the Folger Shakespeare Theatre
clearly serve him in good stead in the
many scenes from Shakespere (Eng-
lish majors, be advised: this play is a

‘Roscius’ delights, instructs

James Shillington (Quinn) and Paul Norwood (David Garrick) perform

great way to brush up your Shake-
speare for Comps) and he demon-
strates throughout the production the
naturalness and sponteneity which
were the hallmark of Garrick’s style.
Female lead Susan Still should be
well-known to W&L audiences
through her memorable portrayal of
Portia in last year’s production of
“The Merchant of Venice’’, as the op-
pressed actress Susannah Cibber she
brings us another brilliant perfor-
mance. Garrick says of Cibber that
her Desdemona had no equal — we
might well say the same of Ms. Still.
Against performances such as Nor-
wood’s and Still’s, we might expect
that the rest of the cast would seem
pale and lifeless. Happily, nothing
could be further from the truth. W&L
Professors George Ray and James
Shillington are both deserving of
praise in their respective roles as the
classical actor Quin and the famous

literary figure Samual Johnson. One
can only regret that the character of
Johnson wasn’t given more lines so
that Shillington, who certainly looks
the part, could really develop the
character. Area theatre-goers have
come to expect Veterans Susan
Crouse, Frank King, and Craig Smith
to distinguish themselves with highly
professional performances, but
rookies Micheal Dixon and Mike Car-
roll should give everyone a very plea-
sant surprise. Dixon’s Samuel Foote
is altogether solid, and Carroll’s Lord
Chamberlain should bring down the
house with its combination of pom-
pous ass and dirty old man. This
minor part is a real show-stealer.
The rest of the cast is too large to
commend all by name, but I would be
a jerk indeed not to call attention to
Madeline Bergstrom’s charming ren-
dering of Molly, the child of Susan-
nah Civver.

If any criticism is to be made of
‘‘Roscius,”’ it is perhaps the lack of a
historical dialogue. In a play which is
as concerned with a_ historical
literary genre such as eighteenth
century drama, we might expect
more use of the idiom of the period.
In its costumes, sets, and music (all
Handel) ‘‘Roscius’’ captures the
eighteenth century rather well, so
there are times when its language is
conspicuously anachronistic. But this
is a minor quibble.

The only serious disappointment I
had was the ridiculoulsly small au-
dience. Ms. Gordon has written a
very good play, which is ably direct-
ed and acted, and it seems a shame
that they should perform to anything
less than a full house. Blow off your
work for a couple of hours tonight
and go see ‘‘Roscius’’ — it’s tree, it’s
informative, and it’s fun. What more
could you want?
