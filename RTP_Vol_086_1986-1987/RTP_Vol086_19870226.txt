Students react to newreg

By MARGARET PIMBLETT
Staff Reporter

 

Registration for spring term
classes this week has met with some
opposition by students who dislike
the online computer system being us-
ed for the first time.

The procedure, which allows
students to find out their schedule
within minutes of registering, gives
top priority to seniors to sign up for
classes with less worry of being shut
out of classes which reach their
enrollment limit.

Seniors were allowed to register
Tuesday at the computers, which are
set up outside Northen Auditorium on
Lower Level 1 of the University
Library. Juniors registered Wednes-
day, sophomores today, and fresh-
men will register tomorrow.

Any student who misses the class
registration day has to wait until Fri-
day to sign up for classes.

This system allows first choice of
classes to the first registrants in line.
Once a class is filled, no other
students may enroll.

That irritates underclassmen who
may be closed out of courses by
seniors or juniors.

“To some seniors, it doesn’t matter
what they take, while some soph-
omores will get pushed out of classes
they really want,’’ said Stephanie
Coleman, a sophomore from
Louisville, Ky.

Meredith Walker, a sophomore
from Germantown, Tenn., said, ‘I
don’t think it is fair that people who
are really interested in a class can’t
take it because other people are tak-

ing it for a blow-off.”’
Walker, an art major, said she has

already been blocked out of a spring .

term art class.

But freshman Dave Fischer of
Hebron, Ohio, saw the situation dif-
ferently.

“‘T can see the benefits for seniors.
When I’m a senior I want to have
these same benefits,’’ he said.

Fischer also questioned the class
size limit. ‘‘If these courses are clos-
ing, they ought to make them bigger
or create new sections,”’ he said.

According to University Registrar
D. Scott Dittman, the system is
designed to reduce the work done by
his staff and by students.

“Tt is saving my staff a lot of
duplication of effort,’ Dittman said.
Previously, the registrar’s office
would enter information from
students’ registration forms into the
computer, which would assign sec-
tions of classes with no regard to the
section requests of students.

Dittman said that many students
combatted the situation by register-
ing for dummy courses which they
had no intention of taking, but which
would force the computer to assign
particular sections of other classes
they wanted. The students would
drop the unwanted courses during
drop-add period the first week of the
term, and would pay the $5 drop-add
fee.

With the new procedures, Dittman
said, ‘‘We have no phantom courses
which have to be dropped later on.”’
He said that that reduces the
workload of his staff and means less
effort on the part of the students.

Read decision is upheld

 

From The Roanoke Times
& World News

 

The Virginia State Bar’s
Disciplinary Board was well within
its authority when it disbarred
former Rockbridge County Common-
wealth’s Attorney Beverly C. ‘‘John”’
Read last year, according to a legal
brief filed by the state attorney
general’s office.

In an appeal of his disbarment,
Read said last month that the board’s
punishment was too extreme.

But a response filed at the state
Supreme Court last week by Gregory
E. Lucyk, an assistant attorney
general, said that Read deliberately
concealed information that could
have exonerated a defendant in a
murder-arson case.

Read was accused of hiding the
recantation of a witness set to testify
that Scot Tanner Mesner was among
people watching a 1984 Washington
and Lee University fraternity house
fire that killed a W&L student. The
witness decided during the trial that
Mesner, the defendant, was not the
man he had seen and told Read so.

The witness had repeatedly told
Read and co-counsel about his revis-
ed opinion and finally told Marshall
Mundy, a defense attorney, one night
during the three-day 1984 trial, accor-
ding to Lucyk’s brief.

Read said in his appeal that the
disciplinary board was wrong to
assume he wasn’t going to give the
information to Mesner’s lawyers
The law and the trial judge’s order
required Read to reveal any informa-
tion that could have shown Mesner

was innocent.

However, Lucyk wrote, Read
rested his case without providing the
information. He said that when Read
realized his ‘‘cover-up had been ex-
posed” and that defense lawyers
Eric Sisler and Mundy knew about
the witness’s change of mind, Read
made a “‘belated’”’ attempt to hand
defense lawyer Eric Sisler a hastily
written note, which Sisler refused.

Lucyk wrote that a “grave miscar-

riage of justice” was averted, not by
Read but by the witness and his wife,
who “‘were convinced that justice
would not be served by the pro-
secutor.”’

Soon after Mundy and Sisler charg-
ed prosecutorial misconduct by
Read, the judge dismissed the case
for other reasons,

Applications rise 37%

 

From Staff Reports

 

Washington and Lee has received
to date a record 3,314 applications for
admission to the university’s under-
graduate class of 1991, according to
figures compiled by the Office of Ad-
missions.

The total represents a 37 percent
increase over the same day a year
ago when W&L received 2,416 ap-
plications.

“T tie it to the favorable ex-
periences of the coeducated classes,”
said William Hartog, director of ad-
missions. ‘“The high retention rate
says to counselors, parents, and
students that coeducation is working
at Washington and Lee.”

According to Soott Dittman, uni-
versity registrar, 392 freshmen of
last year’s class of 410 returned for
their sophomore year at W&L, a
retention rate of 96 percent.

Aside from the record-breaking in-
crease in the number of applications,
Hartog said the quality of the appli

cant pool is the strongest it has been
in years.

“Not only is the applicant pool
significantly stronger as measured
by test scores and rank in class, but
also in terms of personal qualities,”’
Hartog said.

In December, W&L admitted 85 ap-
plicants under the university’s early
decision program. Those students
comprise 20 percent of the 420-
member class that will enroll this
fall.

That means competition for the re-
maining 335 places in the incoming
class will be extremely stiff with 10
applicants for each opening in the
class.

“The competition is staggering,”’
said Hartog. ‘‘It is far and away the
most competitive situation we’ve had
in many, many years.”

The applicants to W&L represent
46 states, the District of Columbia,
and 17 foreign countries. The largest
representation, as usual, comes from
Virginia, which accounts for 19 per
cent of the total applicant pool

The ability to make corrections
isn’t the only benefit Vail saw. ‘““You
don’t have to deal with the chaos in

“There's no room in there to form a

Beard hired as new
Lexington police chief

 

By MARGARET PIMBLETT
Staff Reporter

 

Lt. Bruce M. Beard of the Lex-
ington Police Department was nam-
ed new police chief in a special
meeting of Lexington City Council
Monday afternoon.

Beard had been acting chief since
the resignation of Chief Lawrence 0.
Sutton in November.

City Manager Joseph C. King
recommended Beard’s appointment
to council after completing a selec-
tion process which reviewed 85 ap-
plications for the position.

The council approved the recom-
mendation unanimously.

“T am quite pleased to have Bruce
Beard as our chief,’’ King said. ‘‘He
has proven himself during three oc-
casions as Acting Chief and perform-
ed very well in the selection process
we just completed.”

The other two finalists for the posi-

tion were Lt. William Hogan of Hun-
tington, W.Va. and Capt. Eugene
Rhodenhizer of Charlottesville.

Beard is a 17-year-veteran of the
Lexington Police Department. He
was promoted to lieutenant in 1974.

A graduate of Parry McCluer High
School, Beard lives in Buena Vista
with his wife and two children, but is
planning to move to Lexington.

Beard said that he thinks the latest
policy of the department in dealing
with W&L fraternities has been work-
ing well, and he plans no changes.
That policy includes the posting of
party noise permits outside fraterni
ty houses. Each permit includes the
name of the person who applied for
the permit and who is responsible for
it.

Among the first duties of the new
police chief will be to submit to the ci
ty manager the department’s propos-
ed 1988 budget and to begin the pro
motion process to fill the lieutenant
position vacated by Beard’s appoint
ment.

Sampson’s appeal in
blow dart case fails

 

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Assignments Editor

 

Phillip L. Sampson Jr. has run out
of appeals.

As had been expected, the Student
Affairs Committee voted on the
Thursday before vacation to uphold
the suspension of the freshman from
Houston. Sampson had admitted to
shooting a 15-year-old girl in the
shoulder with a blowdart

Sampson originally had been plac
ed on social probation and conduct
probation by the Student Conduct
Committee. Because he had inflicted
bodily injury, his act was considered
a major offense under university
rules. The only two penalties that
may be given for such an offense are
suspension and expulsion, unless the

case involves “unusual extenua
tion.”
The 10-member SAC, which

reviews all SCC decisions, could not
find any extenuating circumstances

and asked the 13-student SCC to
reconsider its findings. The SCC then
voted to suspend Sampson for the
rest of the school year.

Sampson appealed the case to the

SAC, which upheld the SCC’s deci
sion

The girl, a local high school stu
dent, is the daughter of W&L
Associate Dean of Students Leroy C
“Buddy” Atkins. She was hit in the
shoulder but was not injured serious
ly.

Atkins, a member of the SAC, par
ticipated in the discussions both of

the times that the SAC heard the
case, but he abstained from voting
either time

The incident occurred after the

W&L-Roanoke basketball game on
Jan. 15. Sampson said he shot the
dart from a second-floor window of
the Graham-Lees dorm toward some
Roanoke fans who making
degrading comments to incite the
W&L students. He estimated that the
Roanokers were between 50 and 75
yards away

Sampson said he knew he could not
shoot the dart that far but thought
that it might intimidate them

University Proctor Charles F
‘““Murph’’ Murray said the dart was
at least four inches long. It hit the gir]
in the back of the shoulder, Atkins
said, penetrating about a half-inch in

One rule

In the February 19 issue of The W&L Law News, John
Holleran, a defense advocate for honor trials, was quoted as
saying the single sanction penalty of the honor system left no
gray area as a middle ground, it is too black and white. The
editorial in the same newspaper called for a review of the
Law School’s option in relation to a separate system of en-
forcement for the Honor System. ‘Until they do,” the
editorial said, “the current system of enforcement may
make a mockery of the term ‘justice.’ ”’

Students, both undergraduates and law students, need to be
reminded that the only way the Honor System will continue to
work is by keeping the single sanction. Imagine a system in
which the penalties for lying, cheating and stealing are grad-
ed according to their severity, according to how dishonorable
they are. Student would be more likely to commit honor of-
fenses knowing they could still stay at Washington and Lee.
Punishment for these offenses would be the equivalent to a
slap on the wrist.

The Honor System established by Robert E. Lee had no
printed rules, only the unprinted one that students should
conduct themselves as gentlemen. The abolition of the single
sanction would result in the formation of a new set of rules
and regulations stipulating what is and is not a violation, how
serious a violation is and what the particular punishment

should be. This is completely contrary to the spirit of the
Honor System.

An honor system like ours is not easy, but it is worth the ef-
fort. All who attend W&L know what the system is and pledge
to live by it. Those who are intent on weakening the Honor
System, thereby making it similar to other purported ‘‘honor
systems,’ as seen at other schools, are endangering a unique
system that works.

If students can’t live under The Honor System, then
Washington and Lee is not the place for them.

Study abroad promotes understanding

 

MY VIEW
By Paul J. Smith

 

Cambridge, Massachusetts. 20
February 1987. When it was my turn
to speak, I slowly approached the
podium. I knew what I was going to
say but was not too sure how it would
be received by the audience. As a
representative of the People’s
Republic of China, I knew that I
would have to stick to my policy of
non-alignment with the superpowers
and to the commitment to sovereign-
ty in the development of nuclear
technology in the Third World.

I took a deep breath and started:
“Ge wei nin hau, Jintyan wo yau
jyang de timu—”’

“Delegate you are out of order!,’’
exclaimed the chairman of the com-
mittee, a Junior at Harvard.
“English is the official language of
the Harvard Model United Nations
Conference. This was discussed and
decided upon earlier.”

Then I read the prepared state-
ment which I planned to read,
regardless of the committee’s reac-
tion. “I wish to protest the use of
English during this meeting,
especially since it is a language so
identifiable with imperialism which
China stands steadfastly opposed.
The use of English at this interna-
tional conference is an example of
Western linguistic imperialism.”’

That night I was invited to dine
with Brad Boyer and his parents.
Brad, a Senior at Harvard, was the
Secretary General of the Harvard
Model UN conference. He asked me
what I thought about the conference.
I told him about my speech. He was
amused.

Frankly, he said, no one here could
function effectively in any other
language thus rendering English the
only practical common language. In-
deed, I thought, an idea that I had

conjured up in the guise of jest was
much more serious than I had
originally perceived. But it was in-
dicative of a greater phenomenon
even more critical and serious than
just mere linguistic ignorance. When
I told this to Brad, I don’t think it
made him very happy, after all he
had invested hours and hours of his
time in organizing this Herculean
event. I didn’t want to sound negative
or cynical about the conference
which for the most part, I was very
impressed with.

I told him that the fact that most of
the people cannot function effec-
tively in another language seems to
indicate a much larger problem
among American students (which
the Harvard conference primarily
consisted of) in their attempts to
understand reality outside of their
borders, that is, a lack of interna-
tional awareness, exacerbated by the
inexperience of living in a foreign
setting for a significant amount of
time (i.e. a year). I did not wish to
blame the students in this con-
ference, or American university
students in general; after all it is
really not their fault. It’s just the way
the system is set up.

Indeed here at Washington and Lee
the system is not unlike that of many
other universities around the nation
— students, except for those major-
ing in a foreign language, are not en-
couraged to go abroad in their
sophomore or junior years. And in
fact for those students who go to
destinations outside the beaten path
(i.e., Europe) the frustrations in try-
ing to obtain administrative approval
can add up and pose a formidable
obstacle. Such was the case when I
decided to study in the Republic of
China on Taiwan where Washington
and Lee has no established exchange
program. I spent three months
negotiating with several different
committees and negotiating with at
least three or four deans. My efforts
in this undertaking and my subse-
quent success in obtaining approval
added up to nothing less than a small

What’s the matter

 

MY VIEW
By Marie Dunne

 

It’s more than halfway through the
school year now. That’s enough time
for The Ring-tum Phi staff to have
become accustomed to their jobs and
put out the best paper our combined
efforts can produce. It also leaves
plenty of time yet this year for the
Phi to improve.

A politics professor shared an inci-
dent with me the other day that I’d
like to address. The professor was
discussing with his Politics 102 class
the role of the media. Bringing the
issue closer to home, he brought up
the role of the Ring-tum Phi on cam-

pus.
Every student in that class critized

the Phi. Perhaps ‘“‘criticized’’ is too
mild a word — “‘flogged”’ is morgac-
curate. The students don’t likejany-
thing about the Phi, except the srs
page (something Emrich and Shady
will be happy to hear). They grudg-
ingly admitted that the Phi does have
some redeeming value, in that it in-
forms students of upcoming events.
The students admitted this asset only
after prodding from the professor.
When the professor asked what
was wrong with the Phi, students
couldn’t really put their finger on it.
Some said it is “biased,” but couldn’t
agree on to what or whom it is biased.
Some said it was biased toward the
administration. I hardly think the ad-
ministration would agree.

_ The Ring-tum Phi is a student

newspaper. Thus as student staff
members graduate, the management
changes. The Phi run by Sean Bugg is
completely different than The Phi

miracle. And even when I returned,
the bureaucracy was again at my
throat insisting that I was a junior
and not a senior even though they had
already agreed beforehand to accept
the credits from the American
University which sponsored the pro-
gram in Taiwan.

When I reflect on the many bar-
riers I found in my efforts to study
abroad, I become disillusioned,
disillusioned because this university,
like many other universities, does not
seem to recognize that every student
in every field could benefit enor-
mously from an experience outside
his own country — engineering
students would easily benefit by
studying in Germany or other nations
where engineering is strong. Biology
students would gain much awareness
from study in France where some of
the most significant advances in
medicine are made. Students of
politics could benefit enormously
from study in Moscow, or Peking.
English students could go to Great
Britain or New Zealand to enhance
their understanding and perspective
of British literature. I could go on,
but the primary idea here is that the
lacking element in our education at
Washington and Lee lies in the
absence of perspective — perspec-
tive that could be gained abroad.

Thus having written this much I
wish to do more than just present
ideas; I wish to submit a proposal to
the administration of Washington
and Lee. I feel strongly that
Washington and Lee, as a strong, in-
dependent institution of higher learn-
ing, should institute a program which
would allow all students to study
abroad for at least one semester, but
perferably for an academic year.
Certainly logistical problems do exist
for such an ambitious program, but
to some degree the existence of pro-
grams at other American institutions
could aid in providing the infrastruc-
ture within which Washington and
Lee could institute this plan.

It is my belief that as Americans
wish to become more competitive in

with the

run by Mike Allen ’86. To hold the
current management responsible for
any policy or practices from previous
years that may have offended
students is unfair.

This year’s Phi staff is young. The
majority of the editors are soph-
omores, with only one or two juniors
and seniors. When applications were
being taken last year, next to no one
responded. And so the young staff
took charge, for better, for worse.
We’ve made a few mistakes and bad
judgement calls in the past and for
those we are sorry and regretful.

Many of the Phi’s errors, in my
opinion, stem from two areas. First,
that we are a young staff and second,
that we are a small staff. We can’t do
too much about our age, but we can
change the size of the staff.

A little over a dozen people put the
Phi together each week, donating
much of their free time to do so. A

 

REMINDER'

The honor system is only as good as those who administer because they don’t wan’t to lose. Remember, the only failure
it. There are many qualified students at Washington and Lee is in not trying. If you think you can do a good job — run!
who may hesitate in running for a “‘big-three’’ position

the international arena, institutions
of higher learning will respond to this
need with plans such as the one
outlined above. Clearly, the advan-
tages are countless and compelling.
Not only would such a program be
consistent with the spirit of liberal
arts but would also dispell a
dangerous propensity of American
students to engage in tactical rather
than strategic thinking. This point
was best argued by Professor Milton
Colvin in a recent lecture he gave to

his Strategic Intelligence class; in ’
this lecture Professor Colvin com- ,

pared the way Americans solve pro-

blems compared to the Europeans. °

Americans tend to emphasize tac-
tical thinking and problem solving,

whereas Europeans are more theo- *
retical and strategic in their think- ,

ing. Certainly American students
could gain, especially

in the»

LETTERS

Prof says W&L needs to define goals, values

 

 

To the Editor:

I have been following with interest recent let-
ters to the editor indicating student concern over
the present and future development of the uni-
versity. It is distressing that some students find
it difficult to make friends in a co-ed atmosphere
and that others are afraid that Washington and
Lee will evolve into an intellectual center. Col-
lege gives students an opportunity to remake
their lifestyles and plan their future develop-
ment in a sheltered but open environment. They
get another chance, with the benefit of four years
experience, when they go into the “real world’’
or to graduate and professional schools.

From the faculty perspective what makes the
academic process worth while is the ongoing re-
quirement to present old and new ideas in a clear
and coherent way to inquiring and hopefully,
critical students. In such a setting, faculty con-
tinually evolve new perspectives on old ideas and
even formulate some new ones themselves. An
apathetic student body contributes to an apathe-
tic faculty, and vice-versa.

It seems to me that students should hope dur-
ing their college experience, to aggregate a basic
stock of intellectual capital, mold their personal
lives and work habits free from direct parental
supervision, and develop their own individual
personalities. I would very much like to see more

grass roots comment in the letters to the editor
columns positively asserting student ideas of
what Washington and Lee can offer and criticiz-
ing its shortcomings. Idealizing the last decade
at Washington and Lee is not going to prepare
students to solve the humanistic and economic
problems this country faces, we would hope to
keep from slipping into the status of a nation or a
university with great potential that cannot
clarify its goals and values nor effectively mar-
tial its resources.

Lacrosse plays on ‘dry’ fields

Dear W&L Faculty and Student Lacrosse Fans:

The Washington and Lee Generals open their
1987 Lacrosse Season this Saturday, February 28
at 2:00 p.m. versus the University of Virginia.
Due to the unusual weather the Generals will
play UVA at Glen Maury Park in Buena Vista.

The purpose of this letter is to inform all W&L
lacrosse fans that the athletic department’s con-
tract with the City of Buena Vista prohibits the
drinking of alcoholic beverages in public and to

appeal to all you to abide by this alcohol or-
dinance. The City of Buena Vista has threatened
to terminate the contract if this ordinance is ig-
nored.

The W&L lacrosse program is most fortunate
to have the use of this ‘“‘all weather” field for
both practice and games and on behalf of the
players and coaching staff I ask for your
cooperation.

Thank you and I look forward to seeing you at
B.V. this Saturday and for your support this
spring.

WA&L is 7-0 in varsity contests at B.V. Be there!

Sincerely,
Dennis A. Daly
Head Lacrosse Coach

have hesitated to go to the infirmary
because of the stigma attached to
crabs. He suggested that many
students may have gone to doctors
outside the W&L community.

Symptoms of the lice are itching,
especially at night, visible moving
lice in the pubic hair and eggs (nits)
attached to the shaft of the hair. The
treatment is a simple ‘‘one shot
deal,” said Feddeman. A topical lo-
tion is applied to the affected areas,
much like the treatment for head
lice, he said.

Feddeman added that ‘‘all bedding
and clothing should be laundered.”
He suggested the possibility of-
women giving crabs to each other
through the borrowing of clothes.
Crab lice can also be picked up
through the upholstery in movie
theatres and on buses and airplanes

because they are not cleaned often.

It was rumored that Graham-Lees
was fumigated over break, but it is
not true. ‘“‘No requests have been
made for fumigation,’ according to
James Arthur, superintendent of
buildings and grounds. ‘‘I don’t see
how fumigation would serve any pur-
pose other than in the personal rooms
of the students. That can’t be done
other than through the cleaning of
bedclothes and clothes,”’ he said.

Jeff Mandak, head dorm coun-
selor, said that halls occupied by both
men and women were affected.

New recruitment
group is forming

From Staff Reports

 

An organizational meeting for a
student-run minority recruitment
group is scheduled for Monday,
March 2, according to Dana Bolden,
a sophomore journalism major and
co-founder of the group.

The meeting, open to all students
and members of the W&L communi-
ty, will be held at 7:00 in Commerce
School Room 221.

Bolden, who began the group this
year with sophomore Tom Brickel,
says that while the group seeks to
help attract qualified minorit
students to Washington and Lee, it
not a group just for minority
students.

“We are encouraging as many in-
terested non-minority students as
possible, for without their interest
and involvement, the group will not
succeed,”’ said Bolden.

Diversity, says Bolden, is the far-
reaching goal of the group. “The
group was begun with the idea that
racial diversity at Washington and
Lee is a very real possibility. This
would not only encompass the enroll-
ment of more black students, but
Hispanic, oriental, and a multitude of
other minority students as well.’

Bolden says that instead of becom-
ing a competitive entity to the pre-
sent student recruitment group
operating out of the Admissions of-
fice, the planned minority recruit-

ment group would become a comple-
ment to it. ‘While the student
recruitment already in formation
does a fine job of recruiting all pro-
spective students, we feel that a
student-run organization, formed for
the purpose of promoting the school,
will potentially have a greater im-
pact on effecting minority enroll-
ment.”’

“It will not be a group dedicated to
recruiting minorities simply for the
purpose of recruiting minorities,”
Brickel said. ‘“‘The students we'd
hope to attract would be as serious
about their education as any present
W&L student. However, getting in
touch with those students and in-
teresting them in a Washington and
Lee education will be the challenge.”’

Bolden says that while the group
will remain autonomous from the
school, it will work in close associa-
tion with the Admissions office.
“Their input, especially that of Mimi
Elrod, has been extremely helpful in
the past, giving the benefit of the ex-
perience which we have not had,”
Bolden said.

Any student interested in learning
more about the group is encouraged
to come to the Monday meeting, even
those who question the need for such
a group on campus. “We especially
want those students to provide input,
for their suggestions may alter
aspects or even the general direction
we feel the group should take,”’ con-
cluded Bolden.

MZ Hornets humble W&L;

Hoops season over

 

By MIKE SHADY
Assistant Sports Editor

 

The third time was definitely the
charm on Tuesday night when the
Washington and Lee basketball team
lost to Lynchburg College in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference tour-
nament’s quarterfinals, 82-80, at the
Warner Center.

Three times down the stretch the
Generals made crucial mistakes that
inevitably cost them the ballgame.
With under two minutes remaining
and W&L holding a one-point lead,
senior Fred Bissinger drove the lane
and dished the ball off nicely to junior
Gary Schott. But before Schott could
convert on the almost certain layup,
Bissinger pushed Lynchburg’s Terry
Tabb to the floor. Instead of a three-
point advantage for the Generals,
Tabb hit two free throws to put the
Hornets in front for one of the few
times in the contest.

But the Generals were still in the
hunt until mistake Number 2 arrived.
With 13 seconds left, Hancock flashed
down the baseline and buried a run-
ning one-handed shot to bring the
Generals back to within one. Then
mass confusion hit the scene.

W&L was charged with a timeout
but the Generals had no timeouts re-

maining. The resulting technical foul
gave Lynchburg two free throws and
possession. Peter Soens hit the free
throws and Lynchburg padded their
lead to three and subsequently upped
it to five when the Generals were
forced to foul on the inbounds play.

“I’m not sure (the timeout) was
called,’ said head coach Verne Can-
field. ‘The officials said Hancock
called it. I didn’t hear it called.

“T always tell them how many
timeouts we have, but in the heat of
battle we can sometimes forget,” he
said.

The Generals still had a chance
when sophomore Lee Brading tossed
in a three-point shot with :04 showing
on the clock. And then came the third
and final mistake.

On the ensuing inbounds play, Biss-
inger fouled Mark Manning. But the
official signaled a two-shot inten-
tional foul, instead of the more dif-
ficult one-and-one situation. With the
pressure off, Manning calmly made
both shots and any ideas of ODAC
championships quickly escaped the
Generals’ minds.

‘“‘We always made the effort and
we never quit,”’ said Canfield, ‘but
something always creeps in and
takes away our aggression.”’

The defeat left a sour taste in the
mouths of those in attendance, main-
ly because the Generals had controll-

ed the early portions of the game er
route to a 41-28 halftime lead.

But on the strength of some long
range shooting from Soens, who led
Lynchburg with 20 points, and Fran
Frisby, as well as an excellent se;
cond half from Terry Tabb (19 points
— 15 in the second stanza), the
Hornets slowly climbed back into
striking distance.

The Hornet’s comeback was not
altogether surprising considering the
momentum that was on their side.
Lynchburg wound up their ODAC
schedule by stringing together six
wins, including two wins over
Roanoke, to finish in a tie for fifth
place.

Another old nemesis also hurt the
Generals as they failed to cover the
three-point shooters tightly enough.,
Frisby hit four from downtown and-
Soens nailed three.

“They were reminded about
(Lynchburg’s three-point shooters)
constantly,” said Canfield.

W&L finished its season with a
15-10 record, 8-7 in the ODAC, and the
game marked the final appearance
of the three seniors on the squad: Jef-
ferson Harralson, Rob Spencer, and
Bissinger. Despite the winning,
record, Canfield was not pleased with
his team’s overall performance.

Richard Redfoot have been working
out with the VMI wrestling team in
preparation for the Division III Na-
tional Championships, to be held
Mar. 5-7 at the State University of
New York in Buffalo.

Castle, who finished third at 118
lbs., and Redfoot, who placed second
at 177 lbs., both qualified for the Na-
tional Championships. Castle was
awarded a wild-card berth, while
Redfoot qualified automatically by
virtue of his finish in the Southeast
Regional tournament, held here at
Washington and Lee last Friday and
Saturday, Feb. 20 and 21.

The top two finishers in each of the
ten weight classes, as well as nine
wild-card selections, advance to the
national meet.

“Usually, the third place finishers
in each weight class earn wild-card
selections,’ said W&L head coach
Gary Franke. “Sometimes the fourth
place finisher will make it, but it’s
very hard for someone who didn’t
finish at least fourth to qualify.”

W&L had two additional wrestlers
who finished well, but not well
enough to earn bids to the national
tournament. Senior Jeff Mazza
finished fourth at 134 lbs., and Tim
Walker, also a senior, won fifth place

at 142 Ibs.

Franke was pleased with the per-
formances of both senior wrestlers
but still felt that Mazza might have
done better had he not been hindered
by a knee injury.

The top eight finishers at the Na-
tional Meet are named all-America
and Franke feels that both Castle and
Redfoot have a fair chance to earn
that distinction.

‘Anytime you qualify you have an
outside shot,”’ said Franke. ‘‘A lot of
it has to do with mental prepara-
tion.”

Working out with the Division I
VMI program, Franke feels, is a
good situation for the wrestlers.

‘“‘We’re rotating our staff through
there,’ says Franke. “But some-
times it’s only the VMI people work-
ing witb them.”’

“I’m busy with tennis and [assis-
tant coach] Rolf {Piranian] is tied up
with women’s soccer so we can’t
always work with the wrestlers,”
said Franke. ‘‘But I really think Cas-
tle and Redfoot are in a good situa-
tion.”’

Franke said that he would travel
with the athletes to Buffalo for the
tournament. He said that they would
be leaving next Wednesday, Mar. 4.

A week before the regional tourna
ment, on Feb. 14, the Generals hosted
a triangular meet with Davidson and
Hampden-Sydney.

The Generals narrowly defeated
the Hampden-Sydney Tigers 22-21,
but pounded Davidson 45-10

Those two victories wrapped up the
Generals season with a 9-5 record

mont by over 100 points last year,
returned the favor this year, handing
F.S.C. the second-place trophy by a
score of 444-319.

Head coach Page Remillard felt
that the team ‘“‘had to improve over
the year in order to attain their goal
(of winning Tri-States).”’

Their control of the meet showed
Remillard that, indeed, the men
“had improved to the point where,
even with less than stellar swims,
Fairmont couldn’t beat us.’’ Remi-

lard continued, saying that ‘‘the lack
of overall excitment and pressure in
the meet” caused the men to ‘‘swim
hot and cold.”

He said that he was ‘‘amazed by
how demanding it was to try and
keep on top of two really good
teams.”’

Remillard felt inclined to ‘‘concen-
trate on the womens’ meet, because
nothing could slip or we’d be in trou-
ble.”” The women were in hot com-
petition with the ODAC-champion
Vixens, and the race between the two

teams would not be decided until the
final event of the three-day meet. The
Lady Generals captured fourth
place, outscoring Sweet Briar by only
two points, 266-264.

Remillard felt that ‘the women
swam a super meet,”’ and that ‘‘there
was a battle the whole way.”’ The
Generals lost to Sweet Briar in the
final event, the 4x100 yard freestyle
relay, by .03 seconds, but the Vixens’
time wasn’t fast enough to score
enough points to pull out a victory.

Although the season is over for
most members of both teams,
several swimmers continued to work
out daily in preparation for the up-
coming Division III National Mens
and Womens Championships, held in
Canton, Ohio.

Elizabeth Miles will travel to Can-
ton March 12-14, while seniors Jay
Reville and Marty Radvany continue
to lead David Olson, Jeff Bercaw and
David Reavy in preparation for their
meet, March 19-21.

Steve Castle

 

 

By JOHN PACKETT
Staff Reporter

 

Junior wrestling co-captain
Steve Castle qualified for the Divi-
sion III National Finals in Buffalo
on March 6 and 7, making him
Washington & Lee’s Athlete of the
Week.

Castle, who has a 20-4 record
this season, finished third in the
118 lb. weight class at last
weekend’s Southeastern Regional
Finals and was picked as a wild
card competitor for the national
finals.

The top two wrestlers in each
weight class qualify for the tour-
nament automatically and then
the coaches pick nine additional
“wild-card” wrestlers to compete
in the finals.

“T placed third in last years
regionals, but I wasn’t selected as
a wild-card wrestler,” said Cas-
tle. ‘It felt great to be picked this
year.

“T think if I work hard enough
these next two weeks I can make

[ W&L_ Athlete of the Weeki

all-American,’’ said Castle.

An all-America wrestler must
finish in the top eight of his weight
class in the nationals.

To help prepare for the na-
tionals, Castle and sophomore
Richard Redfoot, who is also
wrestling in the finals, are prac-
ticing with the VMI wrestling
team for the next two weeks.

“I think the experience will help
because they are Division I
wrestlers and better than any I
have faced so far this year,”’ said
Castle.

According to Castle it takes a lot
of dedication to be a wrestler dur-
ing practice as well as out of prac-
tice.

“You not only have to go to
practice but you also have to keep
your weight down,”’ said Castle.

It is especially hard for Castle to
find weight to lose on his almost
fat-free body.

Castle has a 3.7 GPA as a chem-
istry major and plans to go to
medical school after graduation
next year.

 

 

Shades on sports

Sticking together

Things are beginning to look ugly for major league baseball these
days. What a mess.

The players want more money. The ownefs say get out of town. The
players scream ‘“‘collusion!’’ The owners deny the accusation. The
players vow they'll sue. The owners shrug their shoulders and say pro-
ve it buddy.

Chalk up a small victory for the owners in this all-out, no-holds-
barred war with the players for true free agency and the resulting
higher salaries.

Who are these overpaid (for the most part) athletes trying to kid?
They have no case. Sure the owners are joining forces to drive salaries
down, but the players and their representatives are going to have one
heckuva time trying to prove it.

You see, what the owners are accomplishing now through a
fraternity-like agreement can also be attributed to just plain common
sense. What the incredibly stupid (and, considering how much money
these guys have, it is incredible) owners have done is create a safety
device to protect themselves from their worst enemy — themselves.

Take a gander at some of their mistakes in the past. Two million a
year for George Foster? I think not. How "bout a million five for that
superstars of superstars, Dave Kingman? Don’t get me wrong, some
of the stars today deserve every cent they receive. Mike Schmidt
earns his $1.7 million and Don Mattingly is well worth $1.9 million to
anybody’s ballclub. But sneak a peak at some of the players who are
being ‘‘hurt”’ by this collusion. Lonnie Smith is still unsigned after be-
ing offered over $500,000 from his old club for doing practically nothing
last season. But no!!!! Mr. Smith isn’t satisfied with the combined
salaries of 25 school teachers. This dope (pun intended) wants even
more moolah.

The only travesty is that the players that really deserve the big
money — Tim Raines, Lance Parrish and Jack Morris — aren’t going
to get anything for their efforts and will probably have to sit out until
May (the time when their original clubs can talk with them again). It’s
a shame for both the fans and these unfortunate individuals that they
will not be a part of baseball this year until almost the halfway point of
the season.

Why can’t these owners make intelligent decisions about who gets
the big bucks and who doesn’t? I don’t know. But I’d rather have a

system in which the baseball fan can still afford a ticket to see his or
her favorite star than one in which Ray Knight gets $800,000 a year for
looking like a cabbage patch doll.

Collusion? You bet it is. Can it be proven? No. Should it be stopped?
No. The owners need to stick together because as the old saying goes;
“Twenty-six heads are much better than one.’’ Or something like that.

NOTES: Conference champions in college basketball after the upcom-
ing tournaments: Big East-Georgetown; Big Ten-Indiana; ACC-
Georgia Tech; SEC-Alabama; PAC Ten-UCLA; and Big Eight-
Oklahoma... Rendez-vous ’87 was a huge success. Once again,
athletics is able to step over the bounds of political conflicts and bring
people of the world closer together...

‘Platoon’ is reality

 

By MICHAEL TUGGLE
Movie Critic

 

As I entered the theatre to see
Platoon, I did so with anxious an-
ticipation to see the year’s most
heralded film. I sat excited, waiting
for it to begin; waiting for the war to
totally overwhelm me. I expected a
two hour barrage of blood and
violence that would make me ap-
preciate the Viet Nam war and
perhaps even make me feel as if I
had been there. What I received in-
stead was a lesson in reality: A
lesson in what it means to be a
soldier; a Viet Nam soldier; a
veteran Viet Nam soldier. Platoon is
not Rambo, or Missing in Action, or
any other pseudorealistic glorified
war extravaganza. Platoon is reality.
It is the war. It’s the smell, the taste,
the touch, the Death. It’s just that
real.

Platoon is the account of Chris
Taylor (Charlie Sheen) and the
catharsis he goes through at the hand
of the Viet Nam war. Though Chris is
excited about being a part of the war,
he is naive to it’s horror and to it’s
death. Not until he is faced with an
attack of North Vietnamese late one
night does he realize how lethal war
really is. From that point forward,

Chris begins to harden and eventual-
ly become just a machine to facilitate
death and destruction.

In addition to his own transforma-
tion, Chris is witness to a battle of
wills between Barnes (Tom Beren-
ger) and Elias (Willem Dafore) two
commanding officers with different
personalities and theories concern-
ing the war. While Barnes takes
charge, burning villages and killing
innocent people, Elias is perhaps
more humane, and witholds from
killing unnecesarily. Following the
burning of a Vietnamese village,
Barnes and Elias fight and the pla-
toon splits its support between the
two. Chris places his allegiance with
Elias but finds himself in a pre-
carious situation under Barnes’ com-
mand.

Chris’ final realization of the war’s
futility comes through Elias’ death.
As the helicopter lifts the remaining
members of the platoon out of enemy
territory, with Elias having been kill-
ed, Chris sits numb to the world
wondering if there is anything other
than death and deception. At this
point, Chris becomes Elias’ avenger
and reaches his final state toward the
end of the film as he massacres a
group of Vietnamese soldiers in a

nighttime raid. Overrun and nearly
defeated, the captain of Chris’ pla-
toon calls for an air strike of napalm
and the area is destroyed.

Chris reflects on the horrors that
he has seen and comes to his final
resolution as he flies toward home,
now sheltered from everything but
the memories and the nightmares.
The task now is learning how to live
with them.

Platoon is reality. It is not a film
about the good guys winning or one
with a happy ever after ending. It’s
about the 2.7 million Americans that
laid their lives on the line in Viet
Nam and came home to a lethargic,
critical homecoming. It’s about the
men that lived through hell while an
indecisive government refused to
send more troops or pull out. It’s
about the thousands of Americans
who lost their lives in combat there.
It’s about the survivors who are left
to live with the memories. It’s real.
You can almost feel its realness. And
if you can’t feel it, you can see it in
the tears of the veterans who walk
out of the theatre. Platoon is the way
it was and the way it will hopefully
never be again.

Megadeth is not quality metal

 

By CHARLIE GAY
Staff Reporter

 

Is Iron Maiden just too tame for
your listening needs? Do you con-
sider Black Sabbath lullaby ma-
terial? If so, Megadeth’s most recent
offering, Peace Sells...But Who's Buy-
ing? could be right up your alley. But
not if you’re a connoisseur of quality
metal.

One of the : ost ballyhooed of the
current wave of speed metal bands,
Megadeth consists of Dave Mustaine
on lead vocals, lead and rhythm
guitars, David Ellefson on bass,
Chris Poland on lead and rhythm
guitars, and Gar Samuelson in
charge of drums. Yes, those are
guitars responsible for the pseudo-
metallic sludge that pervades the
overwhelming majority of the
album, not jackhammers, chain-
saws, and the like. The term vocals is
also used loosely, shrieks and grunts
perhaps being more appropriate. In
short, the musicianship on this album
is almost uniformly terrible, the
lyrics, when decipherable, are
generally ridiculous; and _ the
delivery, although occasionally ir-
ritating, is usually laughable. To be
quite blunt, Peace Sells sucks

Actually, to be more specific,
Megadeth is a second-rate version of
the kings of speedmetal, Metallica.
This shouldn’t really be any surprise,
either, as group leader Mustaine was
an original member of Metallica.
What separates Metallica from these
Megadeth — upstarts is merely a
wealth of musical and lyrical talent.
Although lengthy, Metallica’s songs,
particularly “Leper Messiah’’ and
“Orion” off their most recent release
Master of Puppets, the riffs are often
classically based, and thus well
structured, coherent and imagina-
tive. Most of Megadeth’s tunes are,
on the other hand, chaotic, frenzied,
and directionless, even on a
marginally good tune like ‘‘Good
Mourning/Black Friday.”’ Lyrically,
like Metallica, Megadeth obviously
has a lot to say in terms of social
criticism. However, Mustaine rushes
the words in an effort to keep up with
the melodies (ha, ha), losing any ef-

fect. Even when Peace Sells doesn’t
fall flat, like in parts of ‘“‘Wake Up
Dead” and all of ‘Peace Sells,” the
reason is that they sound like an im-
itation of Metallica.

‘Peace Sells’’ is the major excep-
tion to the rule. Starting out with an
ear-catching bass riff from Ellfson,
the song proceeds in a basically
orderly fashion, and upon becoming
chaotic (at the end), it features some
very inspired jackhammer,.— I
mean guitar, — playing. The metal is
neck-snapping potent, and this is the
only song in which the vocals are
largely understandable. Megadeth
voice in the song what it seems
Metallica has been thinking all
along: ‘‘If there’s a new way, I'll be
the first in line/It’d better work this
time.”

The only other track of merit, “I
Ain’t Superstitious,’’ shows off
Megadeth’s imagination and is

perhaps more indicative of the
band’s potential than ‘Peace Sells.”
An ancient tidbit penned by old
Mississippi bluesman Willie Dixon is
‘ transformed, though not altogether
successfully, into a blues/speed
metal fusion that makes for in-
teresting listening. Megadeth are
real trailblazers here: there is really
nothing to compare it to on viny),
cassette, or compact disc out there.
So, although Peace Sells is not an
impressive album debut for Mega-
deth by any stretch of the imagina-
tion, there is still hope for these guys
yet. An expansion on the imagination
that spawned “‘I Ain’t Superstitious’’
could earn Megadeth its own niche in
the American metal scene. Until
then, if you’re just itchin’ to soothe
yourself with some speed metal,
Metallica’s Master of Puppets and
Ride the Lightning albums should be
just what the doctor ordered.

No Fancy Dress Ball is complete
without an orchestra.

This year, the Student Activities
Board has signed what is certainly
one of the great big bands in the
history of popular music: The One
and Only Tommy Dorsey Orchestra.

Conductor Buddy Morrow, one of
the all-time great trombone players,
will bring the legendary Dorsey Or-
chestra to Doremus gym this Friday
night.

In retrospect — and in big band
history — Tommy Dorsey’s must be
recognized as one of the greatest all-
around dance bands of them all.

It could swing with the best of
them, and no other band could come
close to Tommy’s when it came to
playing ballads. Tommy Dorsey,
“The Sentimentally Gentleman of
Swing,”” was a master at creating
moods — warm, sentimental and
forever musical moods — at superb
dancing and listening tempos. And,
what’s more, Tommy selected ar-
rangers who could sustain those
moods — Paul Weston, Axel Stor-
dahl, and Sy Oliver. He showcased
singers who could project those
moods wonderfully — Jack Leonard,
Frank Sinatra, Jo Stafford and The
Pied Pipers and others.

This was the era in which the band
was at its best. In the summer of
1941, it outranked every other band to
finish first in one of the most in-
dicative of all popularity polls
—Martin Block’s ‘Make Believe
Ballroom” contest. Actually, this
may have pleased Tommy less than
most people suspected, because for
years he had subscribed to the theory
that it’s best not to be Number One
because, once you get there, you
have no place to go except down.
Jack Egan reports that at one time,
on Tommy’s instruction, he went out
on the road and extolled the virtues,
not of Tommy’s band, but of Artie
Shaw’s because Tommy was scared
that he himself might be getting too
popular!

By late 1946, it was becoming ap-
parent that the band business was
getting worse and worse. In a single
month of December 1946, eight top
bandleaders announced they were
calling it quits — Woody Herman,
Benny Goodman, Harry James, Les
Brown, Jack Teagarden, Benny
Carter; Ina Ray Hutton and Tommy
Dorsey!

For all intents and purposes, this
was the official end of the Big Band
era. And yet, it was Tommy Dorsey,
more than any of the other big
names, who in the years immediately
following was to fight the cause of the
big bands — with words and with ac-
tion. Less than two years later, he

was fronting a formidable new
group.

And so it continues, THE TOMMY
DORSEY ORCHESTRA, conducted
by BUDDY MORROW, is traveling
throughout the country and playing
for the kids (of all ages).

Buddy Morrow as conductor of The
One and Only Tommy Dorsey Or-
chestra insists that the band retain
the authentic sound and style of the
late Tommy Dorsey and still have the
elasticity to meet almost every
musical situation. His repertoire em-
braces, not only the classics of the
original Tommy Dorsey Orchestra
but the spectrum of popular music
from Dixieland, rhythm and blues,

 

 

intricate ballads to progressive jazz
or current rock tunes, and his library
also has a nostalgic representation of
those familiar tunes of the 40’s so ir-
replaceable to the many who loved
and remember ‘“‘Big Bands.”’

Buddy Morrow is one of those rare ,

BIG BAND LEADERS of today; a
man whose s‘.ill on his horn is both an
inspiration to his band and a thrill to
audiences wherever he appears. The
combination of THE TOMMY DOR-
SEY ORCHESTRA and BUDDY
MORROW is as natural as peaches
and cream, and we trust you will
agree, that what comes out best is
what’s put in naturally,
