New head chosen for |

English department

 

By JASON LISI
Editor

 

Professor of English Edwin D.
Craun will become the head of the
department of English next July,
pending approval of the Board of
Trustees, Dean John W. Elrod said
Monday.

“ The previous department head,
Professor Sydney M. B. Coulling
resigned the post in late July for
health reasons following a heart at-
tack earlier that month, Elrod said.

President John D. Wilson and
Elrod will recommend Craun’s ap-
ointment to the Board of Trustees at
its meeting in late October. Elrod
said almost all recommendations of
this type are followed by the board.

Craun, who is on academic leave
‘this year, will begin his term on July
‘1, 1987. Professor W. Dabney Stuart
has been the acting department head
since Coulling’s resignation and will
‘continue until Craun takes over.

Craun said he will consider some
changes in the curriculum of the
English department, such.as greater
emphasis on post-World War II
literature and courses on the history
of the English language. He added,
however, that he thought Coulling

has administered the department
well during his term and “there are
no significant areas that the depart-
ment needs specific attention.”’

Craun was Assistant Dean of the
College of Arts and Sciences from
1977 to 1979 and an Associate Dean
from 1979 to 1981.

Elrod said Craun was chosen
because of his administrative ex-
perience, research work and publica-
tions and that his appointment had

 

 

 

EDWIN D. CRAUN

“strong support’’ from the other
members of the department.

Elrod said he had sent a letter to
the members of the department on
July 28, telling them of Coulling’s
resignation. On August 14, a letter
was sent out naming Craun as the
new department head, he said.

Between July 28 and August 14,
Elrod met with the members of the
department to discuss a replacement
for Coulling and other issues concer-
ning the English department, he
said. Out of these meetings came
Craun’s recommendation, which was
passed on to President Wilson.

Coulling will be teaching one of the
two courses he was scheduled for
when he had a heart attack July 5.
Coulling’s winter term teaching
schedule will depend on his health in
the fall, Elrod said. Coulling has been
teaching at Washington and Lee for
30 years and has been department
head since 1978.

Craun received his bachelor’s
degree in English from Wheaton Col-
lege in Wheaton, Ill. He has a doc-
torate with a concentration in
medieval and renaissance English
from Princeton University in
Princeton, N.J.

Read may face disbarment over sex charges

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Special to the Phi

 

A sexual misconduct hearing against
former Rockbridge County Commonwealth’s
Attorney Beverly C. “John” Read was
scheduled to resume this morning before a
three-judge panel in the Rockbridge County
Courthouse.

The hearing is disciplinary, rather than
criminal, and was brought about by the
Virginia State Bar. It was recessed July 10,
the day after eight women graphically
testified about allegedly obscene sexual
“»havior or remarks made by Read. Two

ichmond psychiatrists were subpoenaed

Wearlier this week to testify at today’s hear-

ing.
Read, 42, temporarily stepped down as the
area’s chief prosecutor July 11. He quit July
’ 18, after the Lexington City Council and

Rockbridge County-Buena Vista Bar Asso-
ciation both voted for his resignation. He had
been commonwealth’s attorney for the con-
servative college city of Lexington and
surrounding rural Rockbridge County for
more than 10 years,

At the first day of the hearing on July 9,
seven women who had sought Read’s advice
as a private attorney said that he had fondled
them, stroked himself, rubbed his stocking
feet on their legs or made lewd comments to
them. One said Read had exposed himself in
his office and had tried to force her to have
oral sex with him.

An eighth woman, who had worked with
Read in the local court system, testified that
during phone conversations about court
cases, Read would describe in crude terms
the sexual acts he wanted to perform on her.

All of the alleged acts were said to have oc-
cured between 1977 and 1984. Several of the
women said they kept Read as their lawyer

because they couldn’t afford another at-
torney or didn’t want to interrupt their legal
cases. Most of them sought his help in child-
custody or divorce cases.

The defense did not present its case on the
second day of the July hearing. Instead,
Read’s attorney, Joseph M. Spivey III of
Richmond, asked for a continuance of up to
six months to prepare ‘mitigating
evidence.”’ Spivey’s request came after
almost two hours of conferences with Read,
his family, the judges and the other at-
torneys. It was met with considerable outery
from local attorneys and the women who
testified.

Circut Judge Thomas N. Nance of Rich-
mond, chief judge of the panel, postponed the
hearing until Jan. 8, 1987. But after a number
of public complaints, the date was moved up
to Sept. 11.

If Read is found guilty of the sexual
misconduct charges, he could be disbarred,

have his law license suspended for up to five
years, or be given a reprimand, all of which
could be appealed to the state Supreme
Court.

Last month, one of the women who testified
against Read filed a $250,000 lawsuit accus-
ing the former commonwealth’s attorney of
“gross legal malpractice’’ and behavior con-
stituting assault and battery. Glenda
Dameron charged that in office appoint-
ments from 1981 to 1984, Read made lewd
comments to her and put his hands on her
breasts and buttocks.

She said Read counseled her improperly on

a marriage and pregnancy. And she said that
Read and his investigators repeatedly
harassed her once he discovered that she had
filed charges with the state bar.

Read has asked that Dameron’s case be
dismissed. In papers recently filed in Circut
Court, he contended that the suit had no
validity in the law and that her allegations

exceeded the two-year statute of limitations.

Read, a republican with strong family ties
to Rockbridge County, is a 1965 graduate of
Virginia Military Institute, a 1971 graduate
of the Washington and Lee University School
of Law, and a Vietnam War veteran. He was
in his third four-year term as com-
monwealth’s attorney.

Read has been especially controversial at
W&L because of his handling of a 1984 alleg-
ed murder arson case involving the death of
a W&L student and because of a recent
special grand jury investigation of area drug
use and trafficking.

Although Read still has his supporters,
community criticism began to mount in late

' 1983, shortly after the grand jury probe

began. The local bar association formed a
special committee to investigate the ad-
ministration of justice in the area in March
1984.

86 Calyx
arrives on
schedule

ee)

By SEAN BUGG
, Editor

 

 

‘~ Although the copies of the 1985-86
Calyx, the Washington and Lee year-
book, have arrived to be handed out
during matriculation, this year’s
book faces a dilemma — there are no
editors.

‘“‘We’re very happy with the book,”
said senior Dennis Francis, who

- edited the ’86 book with senior
Charles Nusbaum. The two feel that
a senior would be an unrealistic
choice for editor because the recent
Calyxes have covered the entire
school year, including graduation.
This would require a senior editor to

* work on the book after he graduated.

» A new graduate who is more con-

cerned with something else, such as
his first job, will not have the time to

* produce a quality yearbook over the

summer.

Also, he might not be able to return
to the W&L campus at the beginning
of the next year to wrap up all the
business.

The ’86 Calyx editors attribute the
“no-editor” situation partly to the
fact that this year’s sophomores, who
comprised much of last year’s
staff, ‘don’t want to make the
move,” and take such a large respon-
sibility

 

The 1986 Calyx will be passed out tomorrow.

Another problem is that people
tend to think that there is no staff and
the editor does all the work

“The staff is there,’ Francis said,
adding that there were already peo
ple who would like to edit sections of

the book, as well as student photo-
graphers and layout artists. Both
Francis and Nusbaum expressed a
willingness to continue work with the

GHQ changes ban pitchers

 

SSE

By MATHEW HORRIDGE
Assistant News Editor

 

Recent changes in menus and pay-
ment plans at Evans Dining Hall,
General Headquarters and the Co-op
offer students greater convenience
and a variety of food, but tighter
security may hamper possible
underage beer drinkers in the GHQ,
according to Director of Food Ser-
vices Gerald J. Darrell.

While point cards can be used in
the Co-op, there will be no pitchers of
beer sold on Wednesday nights in the
GHQ, he said.

Wednesday-night live entertain-
ment in the GHQ frequently attracts
students both above and below the
legal drinking age in Virginia. ‘We
had problems with people passing

pitchers around”’ to minors, Darrell
said. Beer will be sold only in 14-
ounce cups, he said.

Underage people drinking in the
GHQ will be asked to leave and not
allowed to return to the tavern for
two weeks, Darrell said. Those who
resist leaving will be reported to the
Student Control Committee, he said.

Unlike last year, 20-meal plan con-
tract patrons will not be able to have
their contract meals in the GHQ, ac-
cording to Manager William R. Tor-
rence. He says the tavern’s kitchen
facilities were not designed for the
volume of contract patrons who want
to eat dinner in the GHQ.

New sandwiches have been added
to the lunch and dinner menus and
some popular lunch sandwiches are
now available for dinner, Torrence
said.

A new system in Evans Dining Hall

will allow diners to pay only for a
salad if they wish. The line atten-
dants are now positioned at the door-
ways of the dining hall, instead of
just outside the kitchen, to make
meal selection and entrance to the
dining hall easier.

This system is subject to the Honor
Code, however, Darrell said. Diners
choosing something they did not pay
for will be in violation of the code, he
said.

The GHQ closes at 7:30 on Tuesday
and Thursday evenings and all day
Saturday this year due to lack of
business. Darrell and Torrence said
they are considering other changes to
the GHQ, such as Monday Night
Football specials, live entertainment
on Friday nights and keeping the
basement game room open after the
tavern’s closing time.

Freshmen SATs rise slightly

By SEAN BUGG
Editor

 

Average freshman SAT scores rose
slightly this year, according to
Washington and Lee's Admissions
Office.

The Class of 1990 scored an aver-
age of 579 verbal and 620 math, a 3
point increase in both categories. The
English Achievement test score was
475, a ten point rise over last year’s
freshman class

 

In a breakdown of the class by
home state, Virginia is first with 62
students. The next five are Mary-
land, 39; Texas, 31; Florida, 26; and
Pennsylvania and New York with 23
each.

Twenty-five of the incoming fresh-
man were valedictorian or saluta-
torian of their class. Thirty-nine were
National Merit Finalists.

Fifty-nine freshman were presi-
dent or vice-president of their class,

and 73 were president of a major or

ganization. One hundred four were
varsity athletic team captains.

Forty-seven were editors of their
school newspaper, literary maga-
zine, or yearbook.

One hundred thirty-nine were Na-
tional Honor Society members, and
27 attended either Boy’s or Girl’s
State.

Sixty-four children of alumni and
six minority students are in the
freshman class.
 

OPINION
Memories

Watching the freshmen move in this past weekend remind-.
ed me of last year at this time when I was an arriving fresh-
man, and how confused and unsure I was. It brought back so
many familiar memories.to see mthers and fathers huffing
up and down'the many flights ofstairs with yet another load
of their son’s ofdatightet°S Stiff It surprised me how quickly
the Class of ’90 adapted to college life. Not more than three
hours after getting settled, stereos were blasting, and
frisbee, lacrosse, and football games were in full swing in
both quads. Clusters of freshmen introducing themselves to
one another dotted the campus. It was the typical scene that
happens every September on every campus in the country.

But more than the familiar memories, I was struck by how
much difference a year can make. Last year it was hard to
find a freshman woman who had not been interviewed or
photographed. This year, there were only a few reporters
were sent to do follow up stories on coeducation. But reality is
that coeducation is no longer a big story. In fact many of this
year’s freshmen are unconcerned with W&L’s recent move to
coeducation. One freshman was overheard innocently ask-
ing, ‘What year did Washington and Lee go coed?” The Class
of 90 seems to be more concerned with Washington and Lee’s
academic reputation than the state of coeducation.

I realize that there are a few people who are still skeptical
about the success of coeducation. I would like to share with
these people some of the positive things that I feel have
resulted from or at least coincided with coeducation.

First and most importantly is that the quality of students
has increased. Washington and Lee seems to be getting more
well rounded individuals who have high S.A.T. scores.
Perhaps the one word that best describes the type of student
that chooses W&L is “motivated’’. These students are not
just interested in academics, but also in extracurricular ac-"
tivities. This seems particularly true of the class of ’90.
Statistics of this year’s freshmen class show that 59 students
were president or vice president of their student body or
class, and there were 104 varsity athletic captains, and 47
freshmen were editors of their school newspaper, literary
magazine or yearbook.

But more than anything, I was impressed by the fact that
during this past weekend in the midst of all the emotional tur-
moil that comes from leaving familiar surroundings and
moving out on one’s own, so many freshmen exuded self con-
fidence. Many students were more glad than sad to see their
parents leave so that the freshmen could get on with making
new friends and enjoying college life. Many freshmen I spoke
to had definite ideas about their major and career goals. The
Class of 90 seem to know exactly where they were going and
what they wanted.

Second, I approve wholeheartedly of the decision to recruit
more minority students. I believe that college life is
necessarily separate from real life, in that many day to day
pressures have been removed so that students can concen-
trate better on their studies. However, there is a difference in
living in a world slightly buffered from reality and one that is
pure fantasy. W&L’s campus cantains so few minority
students that is an unreal representation of life. Students
must learn that the world contains more than white angol-
saxon protestants. College years form not just students
minds, but also their morals, and W&L, I would hope, would
encourage students to treat each other with equality and an
absence of prejudice. Equality demands a campus full of
varied people, and therefore coeducation and strong recruit-
ment of minority students is a necessity for the good of the
school and the students.

The attitude that coeducation will cause the demise of the
fraternity system is unfounded in my opinion. In fact, frater-
nities seem as strong as ever. I am pleased that coeducation
and the fraternity system seem to have reached a peaceful
coexistance. W&L women are happy to be as much a part of
the fraternities as possible (I know several women who spend
more time at a particular fraternity house than do several of
its members), but the fraternity scene is not the only choice
for a social life. For W&L men, it remains a strong part of
campus life. :

What I also find encouraging about the Class of ’90 is that
they are from various states and that more than half are
from public schools. What I said about the recruitment of
minority students applies here. Not everyone says “‘y’all”’ in
place of every pronoun, nor is everyone in the highest tax
bracket. I believe that it is imperative that the University
have a diverse group of students, not only so that we learn to
tolerate differences in one another, but also so that we can
understand and appreciate those differences.

It appears that W&L is moving away from it’s repution for

 

being an ‘institution for rich ‘“‘gold ole boys’’. It’s more’

becoming a group of well rounded, diverse people who are
linked by a commitment to academics and for that reason I

am thankful for the changes that have occured since last

September.

Student says you can’t go home again

 

MY VIEW

By Susan Lewis

 

Consider it fair warning,
freshmen: home is not the same
when you go back for your first sum-
mer at the old homestead.

Of course, at the beginning it’s
great to be back. You get to sleep in
your own confortable bed again, see
your favorite cat or dog that’s part of
the family, and-last but not least-see
Mom and Dad and talk everything
over with them. But after a couple
weeks of relaxing, or, most likely
working fairly hard im order to save
some money for the fall, it begins to
dawn on you that things are different
— somehow strange.

Though some people may think so,

‘Huh-what’ syndrome: what’s in a name

 

MY VIEW
By Abb Jones

 

“Now where do you go to school?
William and Mary? Washington Uni-
versity?”

“Where is Washington and Lee?
Washington state?”

“Oh, I’ll bet you just love living in
Washington D.C.”

" ? Oh, Kentucky!”

Sound familiar? Well, rest assured
that everyone who has ever attended
this institution of higher education
has at some point been subject to
what I refer to as the “‘Huh-what”
Syndrome. This inevitable occurence
usually begins during the summer
preceding the freshman year. At first
you're taken completely by surprise
by the fact that these hopeless in-
dividuals don’t know anything about
W&L. I mean, where did they grow

MED

 

 

this strangeness is far more than the
idea that after nine months of being
independent, you’re suddenly thrown
back into a dependent situation.
Granted, this does cause some pro-
blems. It’s a Saturday night in the
middle of June, and after a long week
of work, you head out the front door
for a night out with some high school
buddies. Breezily, you add: ‘“Bye
Mom and Dad; I’m going out!” From
the living room comes a quick reply.
‘Wait a minute! Where are you going
and when will you be back?’’ Stun-
ned, you turn around and stammer:
‘‘What do you mean, ‘what time will I
be back??!” Finally, perhaps, a
compromise is worked out, in which
if you're going te be out extrapr-
dinarily late, you’ll call home. But
still the whole idea rankles you, since
for the last nine months you’ve come
and gone as you pleased.

up, ina cave? Surely they are joking.
No one could not know about W&L,
could they? (Then again, maybe you
should check between their toes for
stalagmite formations. )

So it happens:They ask you the
standard question. ‘‘Where do you go
to school?”’ As you answer them, you
can tell immediately if they are af-
flicted by the Syndrome. They’1I tilt
their puzzled heads to one side, raise
an eyebrow, and mutter something
like, ‘Oh? And where is that?” And
of course, since you’re a W&L gentle-
man (I know I know, but “gentle-
woman” or ‘“‘gentleperson’’ sounds
silly. So sue me.) you politely reply
“Virginia’’ and wish that you posses-
sed a very large stick for the sole pur-
pose of clubbing these clueless
wonders.

But wait. It doesn’t end there,
Many times these unfortunates will

name or location of your college. (Or
worse yet, they’ll ask you to repeat

The night out with your friends is a
lot of fun, but after about a month,
even that becomes kind of old hat,
and you realize that something
strange is even going on between
your friends and you. It’s not that you
all don’t think as much of each other
as you did before, but things have
changed. After a year away at col-
lege, everyone has developed new in-
terests and ideas which often times
clash with friends who were exposed
to differing situations and people.
Even more significant is the amazing
way college leads people to make
friends whom, within a relatively
short amount of time, you feel like
you’ve known all your life. At home
again, it becomes hard not to start a
sentence with, ‘““My friend from col-
lege and I...,” often leading uninten-

tionally to excluding high school
friends.

the’’Huh-what”’ Syndrome has reach-

evacuation procedures so as not to
become contaminated and end up in
Georgetown’s registration line come

I am pleased to announce, how-
ever, that there is one occupation
quite familiar with W&L. Yes, the
law profession. (I’m still convinced
that W&L has turned out more law-

in the nation.) You can go to almost
any attorney in the country and he’ll
not only tell you where W&L is but he
will probably include some brief
history of it as well. (After all,
chances are strong that he attended
W&L at some point in his life, or at
least wishes he did.)

Wilson addresses
freshmen parents

As the members of the class of 1990
were putting the finishing touches on
then dormitory rooms, more than
300 parents of freshman filed into Lee
Chapel to hear President John D.
Wilson and a five-person panel ex-
Plain the traditions and rules of
Washington and Lee during parent’s
orientation Sunday afternoon.

In a 25-minute speech, Wilson told
the crowd of the significance of the
Honor System at W&L, the effect of
Robert E. Lee’s presidency and ex-
plained what the freshmen will en-
counter in their first year.

“They will accept responsibility
and they will accept it quickly,”
Wilson said.

efforts promoting the Horse Center in
Rockbridge County, took part in a
ceremonial noteburning signifying
completion of payments for the site.
The groundbreaking itself occur-
red as Baliles got behind a golden

plow pulled by a pair of Clydesdales
owned by Dick Parker of Cana. Other
festivities included an equestrian
review of all the major horse in-
dustry breeds in Virginia.

The concept for the Horse Center

took shape in the 1970s, and, after
legislation in 1985 actually created
the Center, the General Assembly
first appropriated funds for the
Center in its 1986 Budget. The final
cost is estimated at about $4 million.

Freshmen were introduced to the
Honor System Tuesday afternoon in
Lee Chapel. Among other things,
they were warned against using false
identification.

“Do not use fake IDs,” said
Shayam Menon, Executive Commit-
tee president. ‘‘If it is reported, it will
be investigated as a possible honor
violation.”

Menon said that this was not an en-
dorsement of ABC policies, which the
EC may not necessarily condone.

Even with the warnings that were
being given, both Menon and senior
EC representative Brandt Surgner
reminded the freshmen that ‘the
Honor System is not here to scare
any of you.”

At one point in the orientation,
Menon told the group that if any of
them felt that they could not live with
the Honor System, to leave the
chapel and withdraw from school.

To emphasize the point, Menor
gave the freshmen several silent
moments to consider his statement
before the next speaker was it
troduced.

The freshmen then
separate groups with different EC
members for question and answer
sessions on the Front Lawn.

One question that was asked more ®
than once was, ‘‘What if you walk in-
to a bar and are served without being
carded?”

According to Menon, if a
Washington and Lee student does not
verbally or otherwise deceive so-
meone, then it would not be an honor
violation.

Menon said after the orientation
program was over that ‘‘Each case is
taken on its own merits.”’ Any EC in-
vestigation is of a “‘possible’’ honor
violation.

He said that part of the reason he
brought up the subject of the fake ID
cards was to clarify the matter so all
students would understand how it
would be handled.

sorority committee
is being organized

By SYDNEY MARTHINSON
Staff Reporter

An advising committee to organize
a possible winter rush for sororities
is being organized, according to
Leroy C. “‘Buddy” Atkins, associate
dean of students for Greek affairs
and director of student activities.

If the incoming freshmen women
‘show the same.interest as many of
‘the’other Washington & Lee women
had, Atkins says that it is ‘‘conceiv-
able” that rush would begin in
January.

The committee members will be
Dean Anne Schroer, Dean Atkins, the
chairwoman of the Greek Committee
of the Women’s Forum, Caroline
Boone, female faculty members, and
the women students most interested
in starting sororities. Atkins said that
the committee would establish a
“timetable” to work toward.

Boone, who has been working
closely with the sophomore Elizabeth
Cummins for the past year, reiter-
ated that. She has been researching
over a dozen national sororities and
would like to see the committee limit
this number. Then, the sororities can
be invited to make presentations to
students and the actual sororities
which will be colonized can be decid-
ed upon.

Boone was contacted by several
nationals over the summer, whom

she describes as ‘‘very interested”’ in -
colonizing at Washington and Lee.
Atkins cited the incoming fresh
men, several of the faculty, and some
of the returning female students as
possible obstacles in colonization. H«
thinks that most fraternity members

will not be opposed because national

fraternities have been unhappy in the
past with little sister programs which
have not been successful in integrat-
ing WOMEN.» 5.5.0 Peres CSR

“Whether you agree with it or not,
one of the major things a fraternity
does is greatly increase the chance to
get involved with self-govern
ment...Women deserve the same op-
portunity,” said Atkins.

Winter rush of sororities would
have no effect on future fraternity
rush schedules, according to Atkins,
but he said that hopes the men and
women could work together to form
rush schedules at the same time,
because ‘‘it makes sense to do if that
way.”

“The odds are that we'll have
sororities, but it’s not a given,”
Atkins said.

Boone said that she has received an
extensive amount of information
from different national chapters
which is available for anyone to
peruse if they are interested. She
looks forward to sororities colonizing
and said, “I’ll work as much as
necessary to get it done.”’

Mollenhoff receives award

Clark R. Mollenhoff, professor of journalism at
‘Washington and Lee, has been named Alumnus of the
Year for the Drake University Law School.

_ Mollenhoff will receive his award at a special dinner
‘in November on the Drake campus in Des Moines,
‘Towa.

‘ A 1941 graduate of Webster City Junior College,
‘Mollenhoff received his L.L.B. degree from Drake
( niversity in 1944. He received his J.D. degree from
rake in 1968 and was the recipient of the honorary Litt.

from Drake in 1966.

‘ Anationally-known writer and investigative reporter,
‘Mollenhoff received the Pulitizer for Prize National
Reporting in 1958. He is the recipient of numerous other
awards including the William Allen White Award from

the University of Kansas, the John Peter Zenger Award
from the University of Arizona and the National Head-
liner Award for magazine writing.

Mollenhoff served as special counsel to President
Richard Nixon in 1969. He is the author of many books
and magazine articles, including “Game Plan for
Disaster,” an ombudsman’s report on the Nixon years.
“The Man Who Pardoned Nixon,” the story of the Presi-
dent Gerald Ford's destruction of his own credibility

Mollenhoff joined the faculty at W&L in 1976,

Farrar to work with alumni

The new associate director of the Alumni Association,
James D. Farrar, Jr., said he is glad to be back in Lex-
ington — for the third time.

Farrar, a Lexington native, went to Episcopal High
School and came back to attend Washington and Lee
where he played football and was an All-America
player in lacrosse.

After graduating from W&L in 1974, Farrar returned
to Episcopal where he was the director of admissions.
This summer he was named to replace Leroy C. ‘‘Bud-
dy” Atkins II, who moved to the Dean of Students office.

Farrar described the Alumni Association of the last
several years as “‘aggressive”’ and said that he is look-
ing forward to continuing that style of operation.

He said the Alumni Association will continue to spon-
sor first-week cookouts for freshmen because he wants
the students to feel like ‘‘alumni-in-residence’’ and be
familiar with the Alumni Association.

Starting new alumni chapters and revitalizing dor-
mant chapters are two of Farrar’s goals for this year.

Strong alumni chapters, he said, are ‘‘critical for the
success of the University.”
“Tt is our goal to keep alumni abreast of what’s going
on with Washington and Lee today.”

Alumni staff associate appointed

James Caulley Deringer, a 1986 Washington and Lee
graduate, has been appointed alumni staff associate at
Washington and Lee. Deringer assumed the post on
August 25.

As alumni associate, Deringer will work closely with
Kathekon, the student alumni association, and travel to
alumni chapter meetings and contribute to the W&L
Alumni Magazine.

While a student at W&L, Deringer was a four-year let-
terman on the varsity lacrosse team, a member of the
student recruitment committee, the Student Activities
Board and Phi Kappa Sigma social fraternity. He ma-
jored in journalism.

Deringer graduated from Episcopal High School in
Alexandria, Va.

Akins new head of committee

Robert E. Akins, associate professor of Engineering,
this year replaces Michael A. Cappeto as chairman of
the Alcohol and Health Awareness Committee.

The committee, which is beginning its second year,
coordinates alcohol, drug and other health-related
awareness programs at Washington and Lee. It’s pur-
pose is to establish goals and objectives geared toward
the promotion of self health and total wellness through

the education of the W&L community. The initial goal
will focus on the responsible use of alcohol.

There are three subcommittees which deal with
education, counseling and policy and administration.
Last year the policy-making subcommittee was involv-
ed in the development of the current dorm rules regard-
ing alcohol and drugs. The educational subcommittee
was responsible for originating a shuttle bus service for
Student Activities Pavilion concerts to discourage
students driving while intoxicated. This year the corm-
mittee plans to work with the fraternities and other
campus organizations to clarify an alcohol policy reg
ding public functions, and develop a peer counse
program to include the entire university community
There will also be an observation of the National
Alcohol Awareness week Oct. 20-26 and other educa
tional programs throughout the year.

Students interested in joining one of these subcon
mittees should see Carol Calkins at ext. 8590 or Room
104 in the University Center.

Memories

Watching the freshmen move in this past weekend remind-
ed me of last year at this time when I was an arriving fresh-
man, and how confused and unsure I was. It brought back so
many familiar memories.to see mothers and fathers huffing
up and down the many flights of-stairs with yet another load
of their son’s ofdaaghters Stiff! It surprised me how quickly
the Class of ’90 adapted to college life. Not more than three
hours after getting settled, stereos were blasting, and
frisbee, lacrosse, and football games were in full swing in
both quads. Clusters of freshmen introducing themselves to
one another dotted the campus. It was the typical scene that
happens every September on every campus in the country.

But more than the familiar memories, I was struck by how
much difference a year can make. Last year it was hard to
find a freshman woman who had not been interviewed or
photographed. This year, there were only a few reporters
were sent to do follow up stories on coeducation. But reality is
that coeducation is no longer a big story. In fact many of this
year’s freshmen are unconcerned with W&L’s recent move to
coeducation. One freshman was overheard innocently ask-
ing, ‘‘What year did Washington and Lee go coed?” The Class
of 90 seems to be more concerned with Washington and Lee’s
academic reputation than the state of coeducation.

I realize that there are a few people who are still skeptical
about the success of coeducation. I would like to share with
these people some of the positive things that I feel have
resulted from or at least coincided with coeducation.

First and most importantly is that the quality of students
has increased. Washington and Lee seems to be getting more
well rounded individuals who have high S.A.T. scores.
Perhaps the one word that best describes the type of student
that chooses W&L is “‘motivated’’. These students are not
just interested in academics, but also in extracurricular ac-
tivities. This seems particularly true of the class of ’90.
Statistics of this year’s freshmen class show that 59 students
were president or vice president of their student body or
class, and there were 104 varsity athletic captains, and 47
freshmen were editors of their school newspaper, literary
magazine or yearbook.

But more than anything, I was impressed by the fact that
during this past weekend in the midst of all the emotional tur-
moil that comes from leaving familiar surroundings and
moving out on one’s own, so many freshmen exuded self con-
fidence. Many students were more glad than sad to see their:
parents leave so that the freshmen could get on with making
new friends and enjoying college life. Many freshmen I spoke
to had definite ideas about their major and career goals. The
Class of ’90 seem to know exactly where they were going and
what they wanted.

Second, I approve wholeheartedly of the decision to recruit
more minority students. I believe that college life is
necessarily separate from real life, in that many day to day
pressures have been removed so that students can concen-
trate better on their studies. However, there is a difference in
living in a world slightly buffered from reality and one that is
pure fantasy. W&L’s campus centains so few minority
students that is an unreal representation of life. Students
must learn that the world contains more than white angol-
saxon protestants. College years form not just students
minds, but also their morals, and W&L, I would hope, would
encourage students to treat each other with equality and an
absence of prejudice. Equality demands a campus full of
varied people, and therefore coeducation and strong recruit-
ment of minority students is a necessity for the good of the
school and the students.

The attitude that coeducation will cause the demise of the
fraternity system is unfounded in my opinion. In fact, frater-
nities seem as strong as ever. I am pleased that coeducation
and the fraternity system seem to have reached a peaceful
coexistance. W&L women are happy to be as much a part of
the fraternities as possible (I know several women who spend
more time at a particular fraternity house than do several of
its members), but the fraternity scene is not the only choice
for a social life. For W&L men, it remains a strong part of
campus life. :

What I also find encouraging about the Class of 90 is that
they are from various states and that more than half are
from public schools. What I said about the recruitment of
minority students applies here. Not everyone says “‘y’all” in
place of every pronoun, nor is everyone in the highest tax
bracket. I believe that it is imperative that the University
have a diverse group of students, not only so that we learn to
tolerate differences in one another, but also so that we can
understand and appreciate those differences.

It appears that W&L is moving away from it’s repution for
being an institution for rich ‘“‘gold ole boys’. It’s more
becoming a group of well rounded, diverse people who are
linked by a commitment to academics and for that reason I
am thankful for the changes that have occured since last
September.

Student says you can’t go home again

 

MY VIEW

By Susan Lewis

 

Consider it fair warning,
freshmen: home is not the same
when you go back for your first sum-
mer at the old homestead.

Of course, at the beginning it’s
great to be back. You get to sleep in
your own confortable bed again, see
your favorite cat or dog that’s part of
the family, and-last but not least-see
Mom and Dad and talk everything
over with them. But after a couple
weeks of relaxing, or most likely
working fairly hard in order to save
some money for the fall, it begins to
dawn on you that things are different
— somehow strange.

Though some people may think so,

‘Huh-what’ syndrome: what’s in a name?

 

MY VIEW
By Abb Jones

 

“Now where do you go to school?
William and Mary? Washington Uni-
versity?”

“Where is Washington and Lee?
Washington state?”

“Oh, I'll bet you just love living in
Washington D.C.”

“Lexington? Oh, Kentucky!”

Sound familiar? Well, rest assured
that everyone who has ever attended
this institution of higher education
has at some point been subject to
what I refer to as the ‘‘Huh-what”
Syndrome. This inevitable occurence
usually begins during the summer
preceding the freshman year. At first
you're taken completely by surprise
by the fact that these hopeless in-
dividuals don’t know anything about

this strangeness is far more than the
idea that after nine months of being
independent, you’re suddenly thrown
back into a dependent situation.
Granted, this does cause some pro-
blems. It’s a Saturday night in the
middle of June, and after a long week
of work, you head out the front door
for a night out with some high school
buddies. Breezily, you add: ‘Bye
Mom and Dad; I’m going out!”’ From
the living room comes a quick reply.
“Wait a minute! Where are you going
and when will you be back?” Stun-
ned, you turn around and stammer:
“What do you mean, ‘what time will I
be back??!” Finally, perhaps, a
compromise is worked out, in which
if you're going te be out extragr-
dinarily late, you’ll call home. But
still the whole idea rankles you, since
for the last nine months you’ve come
and gone as you pleased.

up, in a cave? Surely they are joking.
No one could not know about W&L,
could they? (Then again, maybe you
should check between their toes for
stalagmite formations.)

So it happens.They ask you the
standard question. ‘‘Where do you go
to school?”’ As you answer them, you
can tell immediately if they are af-
flicted by the Syndrome. They’ll tilt
their puzzled heads to one side, raise
an eyebrow, and mutter something
like, ‘‘Oh? And where is that?’’ And
of course, since you’re a W&L gentle-
man (I know I know, but ‘‘gentle-
woman” or “‘gentleperson’”’ sounds
silly. So sue me.) you politely reply
“Virginia” and wish that you posses-
sed a very large stick for the sole pur-
pose of clubbing these clueless
wonders.

The night out with your friends is a
lot of fun, but after about a month,
even that becomes kind of old hat,
and you realize that something
strange is even going on between
your friends and you. It’s not that you
all don’t think as much of each other
as you did before, but things have
changed. After a year away at col-
lege, everyone has developed new in-
terests and ideas which often times
clash with friends who were exposed
to differing situations and people.
Even more significant is the amazing
way college leads people to make
friends whom, within a relatively
short amount of time, you feel like
you’ve known all your life. At home
again, it becomes hard not to start a
sentence with, ‘‘My friend from col-
lege and I...,”’ often leading uninten-

tionally to excluding high school

I am pleased to announce, how-

quite familiar with W&L. Yes, the
law profession. (I’m still convinced
that W&L has turned out more law-

any attorney in the country and he’ll
not only tell you where W&L is but he
will probably include some brief
history of it as well. (After all,

W&L at some point in his life, or at
least wishes he did.)

Wilson addresses
freshmen parents

 

By JASON LISI
Editor

 

As the members of the class of 1990
were putting the finishing touches on
then dormitory rooms, more than
300 parents of freshman filed into Lee
Chapel to hear President John D.
Wilson and a five-person panel ex-
plain the traditions and rules of
Washington and Lee during parent’s
orientation Sunday afternoon.

In a 25-minute speech, Wilson told
the crowd of the significance of the
Honor System at W&L, the effect of
Robert E. Lee’s presidency and ex-
plained what the freshmen will en-
counter in their first year.

“They will accept responsibility
and they will accept it quickly,”
Wilson said.

He said gathering for parents
orientation in Lee Chapel was ap-
propriate, calling the building built
during Lee’s presidency ‘“‘the spiri-
tual heart of Washington and Lee.”
He stressed, however, that the chapel
was not the only, or even most impor-
tant, contribution Lee made during
his: 1865-1870 term. ‘‘The honor, the
magnanimity, the sense of noblesse
oblige, the reaching out in compas-
sion to others, the insistance upon
understanding another point of view
— all of these things are part of his
great gift,’’ he said.

realize their decisions will affect
théir own lives; there is no one to

On August 13, Virginia Governor
Gerald L. Baliles presided over the
groundbreaking for the Virginia
Horse Center.

Though the Horse Center will not
officially open until late in 1987 or
early 1988, the ceremonies in August
meant a great deal to the Lexington-
Rockbridge area.

H. E. “Buddy” Derrick of Lex-
ington, who was instrumental in
gaining both local and state support
for the project, served as master of
ceremonies at the groundbreaking
and said the combined governmental
and private efforts to bring the Horse
Center to the Rockbridge County was
“in the true Jeffersonian partnership
tradition.”

fast in time for classes, he said.

Wilson said parents should let their
children ‘‘find their own way” to
areas of study and career goals.

Wilson was introduced by Presi-
dent of the Student Body Shayam
Menon.

Following Wilsons’ speech was a
panel discussion regarding the pro-
blems freshmen may face during the
first few terms.

The panel was composed of Dean of
Students Lewis G. John, Dean of
Freshmen H. Robert Huntley, Assoc-
iate Dean of Students Anne C. P.
Schroer, and Professor of Physics H.
Thomas Williams, Jr.

Huntley told the parents of the role
of dormitory counselors in the lives
of freshmen. He said freshmen
should go to their dormitory
counselors first with problems and
advised parents to call the counselors
if problems arise at home which may
affect the freshmen at school.

Dean John explained fraternity

Perhaps a sign of what the
Horse Center could mean to the
Rockbridge County area is the ar-
rival of a new shop in Lexington:
The Hunter and Huntress at 18
East Nelson St.

Owned and operated by Dr.and
Mrs. Brent D. Brandon of Natural

 

Bridge, this shop sells English and
Western riding and tack equip-
ment, as well as hunting, hobby
and gift items.

The Brandons own the Rock-
bridge Cleveland Bay Stud Farm
in Natural Bridge, where Blake
Brandon raises Cleveland Bay
horses, a breed originally from
the Vale of Cleveland, England,
and known for its great size,
strength, jumping ability and
balance.

idea for their store, according to
Judy Turcott, an employee who
has worked with the Brandons
since before the Hunter and Hun-

Business has steadily increased
since the store opened, and now
that students are arriving back in
the area, including students from
surrounding colleges with riding

even more rapidly, Turcott said.

Rockbridge County, took part in a
ceremonial noteburning signifying
completion of payments for the site.
The groundbreaking itself occur-
red as Baliles got behind a golden

plow pulled by a pair of Clydesdales
owned by Dick Parker of Cana. Other
festivities included an equestrian
review of all the major horse in-

The concept for the Horse Center

took shape in the 1970s, and, after
legislation in 1985 actually created
the Center, the General Assembly
first appropriated funds for the
Center in its 1986 Budget. The final
cost is estimated at about $4 million.

Freshmen were introduced to the
Honor System Tuesday afternoon in
Lee Chapel. Among other things,
they were warned against using false
identification.

“Do not use fake IDs,” said
Shayam Menon, Executive Commit-
tee president. “‘If it is reported, it will
be investigated as a possible honor
violation.”

Menon said that this was not an en-
dorsement of ABC policies, which the
EC may not necessarily condone.

Even with the warnings that were
being given, both Menon and senior
EC representative Brandt Surgner
reminded the freshmen that ‘the
Honor System is not here to scare
any of you.”

At one point in the orientation,

sorority committee
is being organized

By SYDNEY MARTHINSON
Staff Reporter

 

An advising committee to organize
a possible winter rush for sororities
is being organized, according to
Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy”’ Atkins, associate
dean of students for Greek affairs
and director of student activities.

If the incoming freshmen women
show the same interest as many of

Y theother Washington & Lee women

had, Atkins says that it is ‘“‘conceiv-
able” that rush would begin in
January.

The committee members will be
Dean Anne Schroer, Dean Atkins, the
chairwoman of the Greek Committee
of the Women’s Forum, Caroline
Boone, female faculty members, and
the women students most interested
in starting sororities. Atkins said that
the committee would establish a
“timetable”’ to work toward.

Boone, who has been working
closely with the sophomore Elizabeth
Cummins for the past year, reiter-
ated that. She has been researching
over a dozen national sororities and
would like to see the committee limit

this number. Then, the sororities can
be invited to make presentations to
students and the actual sororities
which will be colonized can be decid-
ed upon.

Boone was contacted by several
nationals over the summer, whom

she describes as ‘‘very interesie:
colonizing at Washington and L«

Atkins cited the incoming |
men, several of the faculty, and
of the returning female students a:

thinks that most fraternity member
will not be opposed because nationa!
fraternities have been unhappy in the
past with little sister programs which
have not been successful in integral
ing women.

“Whether you agree with it or not
one of the major things a fraternil
does is greatly increase the chance |

Winter rush of sororities would
have no effect on future frate

but he said that hopes ¢]
women could work togeth:

because ‘‘it makes sense to di
way.”

“The odds are that we'll have
sororities, but it’s not a give:
Atkins said.

Boone said that she has received an
extensive amount of information
from different national chapters
which is available for anyone to
peruse if they are interested. She
looks forward to sororities colonizing
and said, “I'll work as much as
necessary to get it done.”

 

‘Northen Auditorium namesake, benefactress dies at 94

 

Staff Reports

 

‘Mary Modédy Northen, a major contributor to
Washington and Lee died August 26, in Galveston, Tex-
as, after a long illness. She was 94.
| Her gifts to W&L amount to more than $500,000, in-
¢luding $350,000 which she donated for the construction
of the undergraduate library. The Northen Auditorium
in the library is named in her honor. She also gave dona-
tions to develop the library’s audio-visual center.

; Mrs. Northen had given VMI, her father’s alma
inater, over $3 million. The William L. Moody, Jr., Hall
was named after her father.

In 1954, after her father’s death, Mrs. Northen was
left with control of over 52 major corporations in her
family’s financial empire. The corporations varied
from banking to cotton.

Mollenhoff receives award

Clark R. Mollenhoff, professor of journalism at
Washington and Lee, has been named Alumnus of the
Year for the Drake University Law School.

Mollenhoff will receive his award at a special dinner
in November on the Drake campus in Des Moines,
Iowa.

A 1941 graduate of Webster City Junior College,
Mollenhoff received his L.L.B. degree from Drake

niversity in 1944. He received his J.D. degree from
rake in 1968 and was the recipient of the honorary Litt.

from Drake in 1966.

A nationally-known writer and investigative reporter,
Mollenhoff received the Pulitizer for Prize National
Reporting in 1958. He is the recipient of numerous other
awards including the William Allen White Award from

the University of Kansas, the John Peter Zenger Award
from the University of Arizona and the National Head-
liner Award for magazine writing.

Mollenhoff served as special counsel to President
Richard Nixon in 1969. He is the author of many books
and magazine articles, including “Game Plan for
Disaster,” an ombudsman’s report on the Nixon years.
“The Man Who Pardoned Nixon,”’ the story of the Presi-
dent Gerald Ford’s destruction of his own credibility
House,”’ a textbook on investigative reporting.

Mollenhoff joined the faculty at W&L in 1976.

Farrar to work with alumni

The new associate director of the Alumni Association,
James D. Farrar, Jr., said he is glad to be back in Lex-
ington — for the third time.

Farrar, a Lexington native, went to Episcopal High
School and came back to attend Washington and Lee
where he played football and was an All-America
player in lacrosse.

After graduating from W&L in 1974, Farrar returned
to Episcopal where he was the director of admissions.
This summer he was named to replace Leroy C. ‘‘Bud-
dy” Atkins IT, who moved to the Dean of Students office.

Farrar described the Alumni Association of the last
several years as ‘‘aggressive’’ and said that he is look-
ing forward to continuing that style of operation.

He said the Alumni Association will continue to spon-
sor first-week cookouts for freshmen because he wants
the students to feel like ‘‘alumni-in-residence’’ and be
familiar with the Alumni Association.

Starting new alumni chapters and revitalizing dor-
mant chapters are two of Farrar’s goals for this year.

Strong alumni chapters, he said, are ‘‘critical for the
success of the University.”’
“Tt is our goal to keep alumni abreast of what’s going
on with Washington and Lee today.”
—Mathew Horridge

Alumni staff associate appointed

James Caulley Deringer, a 1986 Washington and Lee
graduate, has been appointed alumni staff associate at
Washington and Lee. Deringer assumed the post on
August 25.

As alumni associate, Deringer will work closely with
Kathekon, the student alumni association, and travel to
alumni chapter meetings and contribute to the W&L
Alumni Magazine.

While a student at W&L, Deringer was a four-year let-
terman on the varsity lacrosse team, a member of the
student recruitment committee, the Student Activities
Board and Phi Kappa Sigma social fraternity. He ma-
jored in journalism.

Deringer graduated from Episcopal High School in
Alexandria, Va.

Akins new head of committee

Robert E. Akins, associate professor of Engineering,
this year replaces Michael A. Cappeto as chairman of
the Alcohol and Health Awareness Committee.

The committee, which is beginning its second year,
coordinates alcohol, drug and other health-related
awareness programs at Washington and Lee. It’s pur-
pose is to establish goals and objectives geared toward
the promotion of self health and total wellness through

the education of the W&L community. The initial goal
will focus on the responsible use of alcohol.

There are three subcommittees which deal with
education, counseling and policy and administration
Last year the policy-making subcommittee was involv
ed in the development of the current dorm rules regard
ing alcohol and drugs. The educational subcommittee
was responsible for originating a shuttle bus ser

Frats get cleaned

By CHARLES T. GAY
Staff Reporter

 

Most of the fraternities at
Washington and Lee have spent this
past week readying themselves and
their houses for Rush, which official-
ly begins after the first week of
classes with Open House registra-
tion. However, unofficial Rush will
begin with the end of no-contact
tomorrow at noon.

Members of Sigma Chi described
their work in terms of ‘painting,
scraping, and partying,”’ adding that
the house is ‘‘psyched, definitely,”
for Rush.

John Lawson, of Sigma Nu, said
that there was a “vast improvement
in the condition of our house physical-
ly.’ Lawson said his fraternity
“couldn't be in a better frame of
mind for Rush.”’

Fraternities have been watching to
see if any significant changes in the
Rush program will be brought about
by the new Associate Dean of Stu-
dents, Leroy C. “Buddy” Atkins,
whose job is to work with the frater-
nities.

Atkins said his job is to serve
primarily as an administrative con-
tact for fraternities. I’m here to help
the houses improve themselves, and
adapt to change, such as with the
ABC laws,”’ Atkins said.

“The houses should be regulating
themselves, “‘ he said. “The IFC
must do its job, and the fraternities
must work together in order to keep
the Greek movement strong.”

Dean Atkins, and 1968 W&L
graduate, served as Associate Alum-
ni Director before moving to his pre-
sent position, which replaces Dan N.
Murphy, now Associate Director of
Admissions.

Police are optimistic Read

 

By MATHEW HORRIDGE
Staff Reporter

 

The Lexington police force is look-
ing forward to a year of good rela-
tions with Washington and Lee stu-
dents, according to acting police
chief Lt. Bruce M. Beard.

Chief of Police L.O. Sutton has
spent the summer at a police training
program at the FBI complex in
Quantico and will probably return to
work Monday.

Beard said he hopes W&L students
and police officers can work with, not
against, each other and that students
feel free to call the police if some-
thing suspicious is happening.

The Lexington City Council adopt-
ed an addition to its parking regu-
lations July 10, which raises the over-
time penalty in a two-hour street
zone to $5. The overtime penalty for a
public parking lot is $2.

In addition, the new regulation
states that any marked parking

The ’86 editors said they started
from “‘scratch’’ with a large number
of freshmen on the staff.

Although there may be problems in
the near future for the ’87 Calyx, no
problems are foreseen in handing out
the new Calyx to students.

Nusbaum called the '86 Calyx “‘an

space, ‘unless otherwise specified by
signs, shall be limited to two hours
per space.”’

Charges lodged last spring against
sophomore Steve Sadler, of Easton,
Md., were dropped over the summer,
according to Lexington Clerk of
Court Juanita Rice. Sadler had been
charged with assault and battery and
trespassing after and incident at 511
S. Main Street in late May.

police to be related arrested the per-

noted that no similar forgery cases

Police have no suspects or witnesses

‘We wanted to do something a lit-
tle different,’ Francis said, “‘maybe
a little less traditional...still the same
idea, updated.”

One of the ways the editors said
they tried to be different was in their
treatment of coeducation.

“I don’t think we tried to push
coeducation,” Francis said. He
believes that that new Calyx makes
Washington and Lee look like a
“typical” coed school.

Eight months later, the committee
filed a report with the state bar ac-
cusing Read of making uninvited sex-
ual advances on female clients, The
committee also alleged that Read
had betrayed client. confidences, con-
ducted himself improperly during
the special grand jury investigation,
asked a teen witness there about her
sexual activities, leaked secret
special grand jury information to
police and told a lawyer that he could
embarrass prominent citizens with
the drug probe even if he couldn’t win
convictions.

The state bar also investigated
reports that Read had withheld infor-
mation from defense attorneys at the
trial of an alleged arsonist in the 1984
Phi Gamma Delta fraternity fire.
During W&L’s spring vacation in
1984, W&L sophomore Thomas John
Fellin, 19, of Weston, Pa., was killed
when an early-morning fire swept
through the Fiji house on Preston
Street. An outstanding student and
varsity baseball player, Fellin was
president of the fraternity and had
been asleep on the second floor when
the fire broke out.

Scot Tanner Mesner, then 19, was
arrested and charged with arson and
murder. The son of a Hollins College
reference librarian and history in-
structor, Mesner allegedly started
the blaze because he wanted revenge
after a former girlfriend of his from

Hollins began dating a Fiji at W&L.

The case was dismissed in Decem-
ber 1984 by County Circuit Judge
George E. Honts III, who said that
Read and investigators had violated
Mesner’s due process rights.

A state bar committee privately
reprimanded Read for his handling
of the Mesner case. Read has appeal-
ed that reprimand. Although most of
the other accusations against Read
apparently were dropped, the bar
committee did certify the sexual
misconduct charges to its statewide
disciplinary board.

Read had his choice between a
private board hearing and a public
hearing before a three-judge panel.
He chose the public hearing, which.
originally was scheduled for April. It
was postponed until July because
Spivey was out of the county on a
three-month sabbatical.

Assistant Commonwealth’s At-
torney Richard J. Cabaniss was nam-
ed substitute commonwealth’s at-
torney following Read’s resignation.
Cabaniss drew local attention in
August when he requested that ques-
tions from the editor of the Rock-
bridge Weekly newspaper be in writ-
ing, and then responded by quoting
Scriptures.

In August, Eric Lee Sisler was ap-
pointed to fill out Read’s term, which
would have expired Dec. 31, 1987.
Sisler, 42, received both his bache-
lor’s degree and his law degree from
W&L. He was commonwealth’s attor-
ney from 1971 to 1975, when he was
defeated by Read.

The next election for common-
wealth’s attorney will be in Novem-
ber 1987.

Returnees key to
successful season

By MIKE SHADY
Staff Reporter

 

With an air of great expectation,
‘the Washington and Lee football
‘tgam concluded its final week of
preparation for this Saturday’s
opener against Emory and Henry on
‘Wilson Field.

‘Coming off a 7-2 record (its sixth
.cpnsecutive winning season) and a
share of the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference title, the Generals have
12 returning starters, the key one be-
ing senior tailback Kevin Weaver.
Weaver is fresh off an all-world year
in which he broke school records for
touchdowns, points, yardage and
points per game in addition to being
named ODAC player-of-the-year.

Veaver is a crucial part of the
G  ral’s offense, but head coach

#a / Fallon indicated that the play
calling would not be ‘Weaver left, —
Weaver right.’

“We feel that with the success of
Weaver, teams will be loading up
with eight-man fronts in order to stop
our ground game,” said Fallon,
who is now in his ninth year at W&L.

‘We have to mix it up on offense and
ave success passing so as to create

“nice blend. That’s what helped

feaver last year; our ability to pass

ie ball.”

‘Manning the helm of the air attack

ugh Finkelstein) due to graduation,
jt returning is an experienced pass
itecher in senior split end Randy
fown. The slotback position will be
fled by senior Paul Youngman
hile the tight end job will go to
inior John MacDonald. The offen-
ve line returns four of last year’s
ye starters, with All-conference

dary, losing all four of its starters to
graduation. Juniors Chris Jerussi
and Jeff Harwood have much needed
game experience at the corners, but
the safeties are somewhat lacking in
that department.

“We think they [senior Joe Krastel
and junior Mark Oluvic] will work
out, but only time will tell on those
kids,” said Coach Fallon. ‘Their
speed is as fast if not faster than last
year’s players.”

The Generals were dealt a severe
blow during the preseason when
returning linebacker and placekick-
er, senior B.J. Sturgill suffered a
broken bone in his left leg and liga-
ment damage of the left ankle during
a routine drill.

Filling his place at linebacker will
be freshman Mike Pack who will
team with sophomore Tom Skeen and
senior Bob Berlin to produce, says
Fallon, ‘‘a pretty good trio’ at the
linebacking corps.

Up front on the defensive line, W&L
will go with proven veterans in senior
Jim Murphy and juniors Jay
Gorlowski and J.P. Johnston.

“I can’t make a prediction about
the outcome of the season,’ says
coach Fallon. ‘‘Each game will be a
dog fight. I know our opponents will
be ready and hungry to beat us, so we
must be physically, emotionally and
mentally prepared.”’

these two have met with E&H holding
a 9-6 advantage... E&H won last

halfback Sandy Rogers on offense
and he will draw an inevitable com-
parison to Weaver... Says Fallon of

Eleventh year soccer coach Rolf
Piranian is a constant. He has been
named Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference coach-of-the-year three
times and in the past six years he has
guided his teams to a 41-25-4 mark.
This year’s version of the soccer
team is much less stable.

Many players were lost from last
season’s 6-6 squad, putting this
year’s team in the always awkward
position of having to play relatively
inexperienced players in key posi-
tions.

Piranian said that “this team will
be a different team from last
year’s,” but declined to name which

there was an intrasquad contest com-
ing up this Saturday and that final
roster decisions would be made
following that game. ‘We want to
keep the pressure on,”’ said Piranian.

Although he wouldn’t specify, Pira-
nian also said that there would be
freshmen playing important roles on
this team. “There are some fresh-
men who are impact players,” said
Piranian. But he repeated that no
final decisions will be made until
after that intrasquad game.

Aside from personnel decisions,
Piranian seems to have already set
the tempo for the year. ‘‘We’re going
to play a wide open game,” said Pira-
nian, ‘‘end to end soccer. There will
be defenders playing offense and vice
versa.”

The Washington and Lee men’s
cross country team, coming off
records of 14-0 in 1984 and 8-4 in 1985,
look strong once again for '86. The
team lost Eddie Gandry, one of its
top runners from last year but still
retains Scott Rippeon, Ash Andrew,
Captain Ted Myers, and Richard
Moore to lead the squad.

‘continuing with the arrival of the
freshmen on the 3ist, the Water Polo
team has been working from dawn to
dusk in order to be ready for their fall
season.

The General’s workouts are not on-
ly taxing physically but also mental-
ly. Rigorous daily conditioning in the
pool helped the team prepare for an

Even with this kind of potential,
head coach Dick Miller still hesitates
to make any types of predictions.
When asked about his goals for this
year’s team he replied, ‘You always
look to go to nationals but you've got
to take it one weekend at a time.”’

Rippeon, the team’s top runner
from last year, looks once again to be
the General’s number one harrier.
Rippeon was the only General to
qualify for the national meet last
year after placing eighth in the

The first game for the team is go-
ing to be on Sept. 17th at Shenandoah.

unusual Aquatics tradition — The
Mountain.

Beginning at the edge of Buena
Vista, the team ran on Route 60 to the
Skyline Drive, a total distance of 3.9
miles; all of it uphill.

Head coach Page Remillard ex-
plained this odd training method in
three parts. First, since the athletes
are such proficient swimmers, they
are forced to work harder by doing
something at which they are less
adept-running. Second it toughens
the team mentally; and third, it gives
the players a break from the daily
routine of swimming.

The General face their first test
this weekend as they will be hosting
the Fall Classic Tournament. The
Classic features eight teams —
Dayton, Lynchburg, Johns-Hopkins,
James Madison, George Washington,
the University of Arkansas at Little
Rock, and the W&L “B” team,
nicknamed the ‘Killer B’s.’’ The

however, that the fate of the team
can’t rest on one person. “I don’t set
individual goals, we run as a team.”
Coach Miller also emphasized the im-
portance of depth and with a total of
20 runners, he should have it.

The women’s cross country team is
looking to build and improve after a
1-5 record its first year. The team’s
enthusiasm and dedication should
help the building process accelerate

W&L ‘‘A” squad enters the tourna-
ment as the number one seed.

The Fall Classic features two days
of preliminaries on Friday and Satur-
day, followed by the two final games
on Sunday morning, with the cham-
pionship at 12:15. Remillard says
that he is optimistic that W&L will be
in the final, possibly, he thought,
against Johns-Hopkins.

This year the Generals hope to
reverse seven years of ‘“‘tradition’’
and. for the first time, bring home
the coveted Fall Classic trophy.
Remillard said that he would like
W&L to win the tournament because
the champions are traditionally one
of the strongest teams in the East.

‘We have a good team nucleus,”’
said Remillard, ‘‘and an awful lot of

team potential.” He continued, ‘Last

year was a building year, this year
can’t be.”’

this past week busily recruiting new
members for this year’s team. The
women’s team now totals 20 runners,
same as the men’s team. Coach
Miller, also the head coach of the
women’s team, says that ‘‘it takes a
little time to build a women’s team,
but we’ve got the numbers now.”’

However, the women’s team has
lost its captain and top runner from
last year, Carolyn Arbogast, to a
knee injury. She is not expected to
run this season.

Baffling cover art tonew R.E.M. Lp.

R.E.M.’s rich pageant

 

By MARK TRAINER
Music Critic

 

The beginning of a Washington and
Lee school year invariably brings
with it those few records that will be
played repeatedly through every
fraternity tape deck, three-fourths of
the car stereos on campus, and about
half the speakers in the quad. For the
past three years, the summer R.E.M.
reJeases have been shoe-ins for the
collegiate top-of-the-pops. Their most
recent effort, “Lifes Rich Pageant,”
is definitely the most accessible and
arguably the best music R.E.M. has
produced to date.

Many people, like myself, have
been watching nervously as R.E.M.
makes the difficult transition from
underground heroes to something a
cut above the mainstream. What is
remarkable is how well they have
navigated this dangerous route. As
they’ve progressed from ‘Chronic
Town’ to ‘Lifes Rich Pageant,” they

   

have stayed true to the elements ot
their music that brought them
critical acclaim; at the same time,
they’ve shown a willingness to
develop and experiment.

If, on their fourth full-length
album, Michael Stipe had still been
mumbling incoherently, the whole
act would be a little redundant.
Rather, we can now understand
every word. As well, the laid-back,
neo-folk image is left behind — drop
the needle on the album’s opener, the
startingly good and kinetic “Begin
the Begin,’’ for instance. Stipes’
vocals and Peter Buck’s guitar have
never been better. And the lyrics,
now crystal clear, do not disappoint
(although I’m sure phrases like
“Miles Standish proud”’ and ‘‘Martin
Luther’s sin” evoke much more for
Michael Stipe than they might for the
average listener).

However, there is still plenty of the
old R.E.M. on “Lifes Rich Pageant.”
The cover art will leave even the
most psychedelic mind saying,
“What?”’ Stipe still stretches short

Duo makes record - sort of

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Enter tainment Editor

 

When Heinsohn & Day, an acoustic
duo made up of Washington & Lee
alumni, decided to make a record,
they soon found out that it was not go-
ing to be as easy as they had initially
planned. Now, making a cassette
tape was no problem: It was putting

warmth, competent musicianship
and warm emotional impact. For
Heinsohn & Day, this record has been
more than a personal triumph: It has
proven to a great many people that
this is a serious musical endeavor.

‘We've had great response,’ Vay
said. ‘‘This is from both musical and
non-musical people. They are sur-
prised by how professional it

 

 

little phrases over two or three
measures. (What were once ‘‘Ko-hou-
tek”’ and ‘‘I’m s-0-0-0-r-r-y’’ are now
““Cuy-a-hoo-ga”’ and ‘“‘Hy-eee-na.”’)
And Peter Buck thankfully prefers a
ringing guitar chord to rumbling lead
work.

Among the album’s highlights are
“Fall On Me’”’ (the closest thing to a
single on the record) with its plea-
sant acoustic feel; “Cuyahoga,” a
soaring pastoral plea for a mythica)
and ideal civilization; and ‘Swan
Swan H,” a mystical fable song in
which Stipe impressively pulls off the
line “‘What noisy cats are we”
without cracking a smile. Also wor-
thy of note are “Underneath the
Bunker,’’ an amusing piece of cheesy
cinema music and a Who-like cover
of the Champs’ “Superman” with
Bill Berry premiering on lead vocal.

Perhaps the most enjoyable thing

about “‘Lifes Rich Pageant”’ is how it
proves that a group that many
thought would run out of ideas early
in the game is still only discovering
the power of its own voice.

the thing on vinyl that was causing
all the trouble.

“There are all sorts of legal pro-
blems with vinyl,’ Enic Heinsohn
said. “You have too contend with
government regulations and copy-
write laws...”

“Basically, you have to join this °"®
union,” Roger Day said. “You have _“‘It’s important that people under-

money and that al omakea pretty much what they might hear if

Well, Heinsohn & Day are not union said.

cassette form. But it is still a ject matter, they both admitted that
“record.” In fact, itis one step better the songs were, for the most part,
than a record since one can play iton drawn from experiences in their per-

engineered by themselves and Rob- ‘There is a difference between
bie Cribbs right here in Lexington’s bluntly saying something personal

sounds.”

The production is crisp and
straightforward, the performances
are tight and powerful. It is, accord-
ing to Heinsohn, the closest thing to a
live record without actually being

 

 

ly,’’ Heinsonn said.

For instance, Day admitted that
his song ‘Everybody Sing” was in-
spired by a particularly exciting and
rewarding performance at the Sub-
way. The song, however, stands on
its own without that personal infor-
mation. Hum along and you'll see
what I mean.

Heinsohn’s ‘‘Telephone Song
(Please Don’t Go)”’ gains much of its
emotional power from the convictidn
and understanding he brings to the
subject of a long-distance relationsip.
Anyone who has ever suffered
through one of those can certainly
sympathize with the song’s forlorn
longing.

And who cannot sympathize with
Heinsohn’s grand social commen-
tary, ‘Leave Your Mudpack On
Tonight?’ Personally, I guess I say
this phrase every, oh, three or four
days. At least.

The record can be purchased either
through a mail order or directly from
the band itself. For those bargain
shoppers who insist on “‘trying before
buying,’’ Heinsohn & Day will be per-
forming at the Subway tonight and at
Randolph-Macon Women’s College
this Sunday. And remember Roger
Day’s advice: Everybody Sing!
