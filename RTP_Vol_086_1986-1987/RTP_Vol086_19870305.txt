KA and Phi Psi experience fraternity woes

VMI Cadets attack Phi Kappa Psi

~

By SAMUEL FOLEY
Staff Reporter

 

One Washington and Lee student
and six Virginia Military Institute
Cadets were arrested last Saturday
evening after a large brawl broke out
between the members of the Phi Kap-
pa Psi fraternity house and 75 to 100
cadets.

“They came prepared to fight,”’
was the way Sgt. T. H. Pederson of
the Lexington Police Department
described the VMI Cadets who ap-
peared at the Phi Kappa Psi fraterni-
ty house. ‘“‘Several of the cadets had
their hands wrapped in tape and
were wearing mouth pieces. It was
strictly an organized raid. Very
organized,’ Pederson said.

The brawl started after two cadets,
M. G. Murray and and William E.
Miller, were asked to leave a party at
the Phi Psi house, according to Lex-
ington Police Chief Bruce Beard.

The cadets said that they were ask-
ed if they belonged at the party, to
which they said they did not. The
cadets said that immediately after
this, they were attacked by six to 10
W&L students.

Phi Kappa Psi President John
McDonald disagreed with the ac-
counts from VMI on how the fight
started. ‘“‘Two VMI cadets came to

the door and were not allowed in. I
know they were asked to leave and
the people working the door were
having some trouble getting them to
go.” He said that words were ex-
changed and some punches were
thrown.

McDonald denied the report that
the two cadets were attacked by six
to 10 students. ‘‘I know that can’t be
true because we only had two or
three guys working the door,” he
said

After the fight had been broken up,
the cadets returned to VMI where the
story of what had happened spread
through the barracks, according to
the reports the cadets filed at VMI.

At approximately 12:30 a.m., 75-100
cadets were seen by Sgt. Pederson
and W&L proctor Charles “Murph”
Murray gathering behind the Phi Psi
house. Pederson and Murray tried to
put themselves between the two
groups and more police officers were
summoned to the scene.

“We got to the scene before it got
really bad. We managed to keep most
of the people separated,’”’ Pederson
said.

According to reports from VMI, the
officer on duty was called at around
one in the morning and told that there
was a group of cadets outside of a
fraternity house and that that trouble
was brewing. The officer immediate-

ly posted guards around the barracks
to prevent more cadets from leaving
the post and to identify any returning
from the brawl. He then proceeded to
the scene.

On the way to the house he met
several cadets on the street who were
heading into town. He ordered the
cadets to return to the post and
report to the officer of the guard,
which none of them did.

In addition, none of the cadets who
were at the scene were identified
upon returning to the post, so no
disciplinary action can be taken.

When the officer arrived at the
scene, the cadets had disbursed, and
he went to the police station to check
on the cadets who were arrested.

Capt. Harold Willcockson, deputy
commandant of VMI, said the
reports that the cadets had filed to
his office indicated that the incident
was started by the Washington and
Lee students.

When asked how such a large
number of cadets could get off cam-
pus to participate in such a raid
without being noticed, Capt.
Willcockson responded that the
cadets crawl out through windows in
the back of the barracks and sneak
off the back of the post.

KA punished for scavenger hunt

 

By SAMUEL FOLEY
Staff Reporter

 

The Kappa Alpha pledge program
has been suspended as a result of a
scavenger hunt that took place in
Washington D.C. and several other
cities which led to one student spend-
ing the night in jail.

According to Dean Leroy C. ‘‘Bud-
dy’ Atkins, a group of KA pledges
went to Washington D.C. on the
weekend of January 10 to obtain
various items. In the course of the
scavenger hunt, a student was ar-
rested for trying to steal a license
plate from a car. In addition, an
American flag was stolen from a na-
tional monument.

The punishment was handed down
in a special meeting of the Inter-
Fraternity Council judicial board on
the Thursday before the Washington
break.

Atkins said that the reason the case
was heard in the special meeting was
that the incidents had become public
knowledge and been in the air so long
with “E.C. problems” that the IFC
thought it was best to deal with it as
soon as possible.

The full punishment handed by the
IFC and approved by SAC is:

The Big Three candidates at Wednesday’s forum.

Big Three candidates all
agree on single sanction

 

By SEAN BUGG
and JOHN PENSEC
Staff Reporters

All candidates for the Big Three
Executive Committee offices, presi-
dent, vice-president and secretary,
support the single sanction honor
system. One presidential candidate
called it ‘the foundation of
Washington and Lee.”’

The Honor System was just one
topic discussed at an E.C. sposored
candidate forum yesterday. Other
topics included the law school,
jurisdiction of the honor system and
the transition to coeducation.

The forum was originally schedul-
ed for Tuesday but was postponed at
Monday night’s E.C. meeting. It was
learned that posters notifying can-
didates of filing deadlines were not
posted in the law school until Satur-
day, four days after they were posted
on the undergraduate campus.

All candidates were also against a
separate judicial system for the law
school. Junior Brandt Wood, can-
didate for president said law students
‘would lose a valuable sense of tradi-
tion and unity.”

Chris deMovellan, candidate for
vice president, said law students
“protect the innocence of the accused
more than the undergraduates can
do.”

“‘T would see that as a last resort,”
said sophomore Valerie Pierson, a
candidate for secretary.

The Candidates did acknowledge
that law students do have greater
knowledge of trial porcedures.

In discussing the transition from
coeducation, most of the candidates
thought the transition was going well.
The lone dissenter was presidential
candidate Rick Robins.

“TI believe in the long run the
university has been raped. They (the
administration) are trying to na-
tionalize the university,’’ he said.

By Perry S. Hayes/The Ring-tum Phi

The candidates for president were
asked in a question from the floor
about the ‘“‘micromanagement of stu-
dent affairs by John Wilson.’’ When
one candidate asked for a clarifica-
tion, senior E.C. representative An-
drew Caruthers said, ‘What beefs do
you have with Dacron John?”
Caruthers did not ask the original
question.

Wood said he sees Wilson focusing
on outward issues instead of internal-
ly and that it would be beneficial if he
made a study of the school’s
historical perspective.

Robins went one step further.
“Wilson and his team of bureaucrats
have gone a bit too far,” he said.

Another question from the floor
was addressed to the vice presiden-
tial candidates. They were asked if
the Students Activities Board’s funds
should be limited or changes because
of recent losses.

pledge activities or labor before the
program is restarted)

The pledge program cannot
restart until a new pledge program
for the rest of this year is presented
and approved by the IFC judicial
board

*KA must present a new pledge
program for future pledge classes
that has been approved by their na-
tional fraternity

*KA pledge classes will be on con-
duct probation through June of 1988

The entire KA house in on conduct
probation through the rest of winter
term

eThe KA pledge class must do a
public service project which will re-
quire the pledges to go to all the
fraternity houses and offer to return
other items accumulated on scaven-
ger hunts.

According to Atkins, the pledge
who was arrested for trying to steal a
license plate was drunk and acted on
his own because the license plate was
not on the list of things for the
pledges to obtain. No charges were
filed against the student and he was
released the next morning.

Atkins said a flag was stolen by a
student who was drunk and acting on
his own initiative. ‘Neither the flag
nor the license plate were on the list
the brothers had given the pledges.
They were both acting on their own.

But I know the flag has been return-
ed,” he said.

IFC President Chris Saxman said
that the judicial board only punished
KA for the scavenger hunt and not
the acts that took place during the
hunt. He also pointed out that any
scavenger hunts that take place out-
side the city limits of Lexington are
strictly forbidden by the IFC by-
laws.

Because the license plate and flag
incidents may involve the honor
system and due to the confidential
nature of Executive Committee in-
vestigations and proceedings, none of
the members of the Executive Com-
mittee could comment on the situa-
tion.

The Executive Committee did
clarify its position on scavenger
hunts, stating that items taken on
such hunts without permission or be-
ing paid for will be investigated as
honor offenses.

When asked why the pledges were
being punished for something the
brothers told them to do, Atkins said,
‘‘When there is a pledge program we
hand down punishments affecting the
pledge program. When there are
social problems we hand down
punishments affecting social ac-
tivities. Pledge probation has a
marked effect on the fraternity.”

NCAA clears policy
on 12-12-6 terms

 

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Assignments Editor

 

Barring a communications mixup,
Washington and Lee’s dispute with
the National Collegiate Athletic
Association concerning the eligibility
of W&L football running back Chris
Coffland is over.

The NCAA Academic Require-
ments Committee decided this week
that W&L students must take a
minimum of 10 academic credits in
the fall term, 10 in the winter and
three in the spring to be eligible to
participate in intercollegiate
athletics, according to W&L
Registrar Scott Dittman and W&L
Athletic Director William D.
McHenry.

Student athletes also must take at
least 24 total credits during the
school year, the two said.

McHenry was told by an NCAA
representative Wednesday night that
because of the calendar ruling, the
case against Coffland had been drop-
ped. Coffland was declared ineligible
for the last two games of the 1986
football season after the NCAA learn-
ed he was taking 10 credits.

He had faced the possibility of sit-
ting out between two and seven
games in 1987.

“Coffland is okay,’’ McHenry said
Wednesday night. ‘‘It’s been a long,
hard fight, but we finally won it.”

But McHenry stressed that he
wanted to receive written confirma-
tion of both decisions before he would
truly consider the fight won. Dittman
expressed similar sentiments.

Coffland, a junior from Baltimore,
was declared ineligible by the NCAA
in early November because he was
not registered for 12 credits during
the fall term. He could not be reached
for comment Wednesday night.

Immediately following the surprise
ruling, McHenry had asked all W&L
coaches to make sure their athletes
were taking 12 academic credits each
term. Wrestling co-captain Jeff Maz-
za, a senior from Bayshore, N.Y.,

was not allowed to wrestle for W&L
during the fall term because he was
taking an underload, McHenry said.

 

 

 

 

 

Chris Coffland

Mazza now is taking a full academic
load and wrestled the entire winter.

Mazza was the only other athlete
directly affected by the Coffland
decision, which was immediately ap-
pealed by W&L.

The dispute focused on W&L’s non-
traditional academic calendar,
which consists of two terms lasting 12
weeks and a six-week spring term.
Because of the calendar, W&L
students take fewer credit-hours per
term than students at other schools.

NCAA bylaw 5-1-C requires that a
student-athlete be registered in a
minimum of 12 semester or quarter
hours, “or a similar minimum
academic load as determined by the
NCAA Eligibility Committee in an in-
stitution that determines registration
other than on a traditional semester
or quarter-hour basis or conducts a
cooperative educational program.”’

A normal academic load at W&L is
12 to 14 credits, inclusive, per 12-
week term. Any amount below that is
considered an underload.

Students must be taking nine credit
hours per term in the fall and winter
terms to compete in intercollegiate
athletics for W&L, according to the
current university catalog. Coffland
was enrolled in 10 credits, but the
NCAA applied its 12-hour require-
ment to his fall term and ruled him
ineligible.

Finance club will appeal to a broad range of students

By TOM BRICKEL
Staff Reporter

 

Finance is probably the single
most popular field among Wash-
ington and Lee graduates entering in-
to a career, says Joseph Goldsten,
professor of administration at W&L.

Given this interest in finance
among business and nonbusiness ma-
jors alike, a student organization is
being formed which will orient

students toward practical and prag-
matic applications of finance. Called
the Washington and Lee student
chapter of the Financial Man-
agement Association (FMA), the
chapter will have its first meeting
Thursday, March 12, at 4:00 in Com-
merce School room 221.

According to Goldsten, advisor for
the group, students interested in the
field of finance need not be business
majors to be a part of the student-run
organization. ‘‘Interest and enthus-
iasm, not experience, are the only re-
quirements for getting involved,”
says Goldsten. ‘Students who have

taken courses in finance will find that
the organization tends to augment
their classroom experience.
However, everyone is encouraged to
participate.”

The FMA is a professional organ-
ization of financial executives,
analysts, professors, and students
who live and work in cities through-
out the world. FMA is also the only
finance association which has been
successful in bringing students, pro-
fessors, and practitioners of finance
together for their mutual benefit.

“It is a pragmatically-oriented
society which offers students an op-

portunity to begin their professional
development while they are still in
school,” said Goldsten. ‘Through
membership in FMA, they will be ex-
posed on a personal basis to the peo-
ple who can offer much practical ad-
vice and insight into the field of
finance.”

Students joining the organization
will receive publications from FMA,
such as a “Careers in Finance’
booklet, and ‘Financial Manage-
ment,”’ a journal allowing students to
keep abreast of the latest issues in
finance.

In addition, FMA honors outstand-

ing students in finance through the
established FMA National Honor
Society, the only national honorary
which specifically recognizes out-
standing achievement in finance.

“As this will be a student-run
organization, the possibilities for this
organization are almost limitless,”
Goldsten said. ‘From sponsoring
speakers and talking to them on a
one-to-one basis, to pursuing projects
related to finance, students will be
able to pursue the field in whatever
direction their interest takes them,”
he added.
 

 

 

 

 

OPINION

 

Security

The doors to women’s sections of the dorms are now locked
from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m., a policy taking effect last Friday
night. The new policy is being implemented because of
several serious incidents in the freshman dorms involving in-
dividuals outside of the W&L community.

All the incidents have involved non-university men. The
men have stolen items from the dorms, and, in one case,
harassed a young freshman woman. The majority of these in-
cidents have occured in the women’s sections of the dorms.

There are several drawbacks to the change in rules. While
visitation hours remain the same (if the hall has 24 hour
visitation, men still are allowed on the hall at all times),
women will have to let all visitors into their sections. Spon-
taneous visits will no longer be possible, and freshmen must

now carry their keys with them. Dorm counselors must make
sure that the doors are locked and unlocked at the designated

times. If a dorm lounge is accessed from the women’s sec-
tions, students who don’t live in that section will have a hard
time using the lounge after 11 p.m.

While these drawbacks are unfortunate, there doesn’t ap-
pear to be any alternative. W&L has been lucky that
something more serious hasn’t happened before now. ‘‘Crime
is 95 percent opportunity and 5 percent incentive,” according
to Assistant Proctor Burr Datz. And W&L’s honor code that
gives us so much freedom also gives criminals plenty of op-
portunity.

It is unfortunate that circumstances make it necessary to
lock doors to women’s sections. Hopefully, the student body
will soon grow used to carrying their keys and calling ahead
before dropping in on a female freshman friend. Surely, it’s a
small thing to do to insure the safety of fellow W&L students.
Unless, of course, someone can think of an alternative...

The vote

“The Big Three’’ election is coming up soon. It’s the
responsibility of the students of Washington and Lee to
familiarize themselves with the candidates.

The Executive Committee holds enormous power on this
campus. Not only does the Committee investigate and try all
possible honor violations, they control many aspects of stu-
dent organizations and activities. Obviously, the students
who serve on the committee must be well qualified and con-
cientious.

There was a session Wednesday afternoon in the C-school
that gave students a chance to ask questions of all the can-
didates. The session was not very well attended, considering
the size of the student body. The session was moved from its
originally annouced location. Perhaps this has something to
do with the attendance, or the lack thereof.

Looking back, we see how much can change during a year.
It is important that our student leaders genuinely reflect stu-
dent views. In order to select the candidate that does best

represent student opinion, the voters must make an informed
decision.

We urge you to find out about the candidates. If you don’t
know any of the candidates, find out who they are. Find out
about what they think about fraternities, coeducation, the ex-
panding university size and the myriad of issues that affect
students at W&L. The people we elect will not only judge
honor trials or decide how much money each student
organization will receive, they will represent W&L and its
students’ opinions throughout the year.

MY VIEW
By MARK FARLEY

 

This past Monday evening, I at-
tended the organizational meeting of
the Minority Recruitment Commit-
tee (MRC). Since I am co-chairman
of the Student Recruitment Commit-
tee and play a role in the admissions
process, I wanted to find out what the
MRC and its members were setting
out to accomplish. The time was well
spent.

First, the founders of the MRC are
to be applauded. Unlike some of their
peers, they are seeking to play an ac-
tive, rather than a passive role in the
life of this institution. They have
identified what they see as problems
at Washington and Lee and are set-
ting out to correct them. The in-
itiative of the founders as well as the
initiative of those who attended the
meeting is commendable.

Second, the founders of the MRC
are correct. Washington and Lee
needs to examine the life of its
minority students and analyze the
University’s recruitment of
minorities. The MRC should consider
these subjects and look at how
minority life at W&L is perceived by
prospective students. The committee
should then make a determination on
how Washington and Lee could be
made more attractive to minority
students.

These should be the Minority
Recruitment Committees’s main
goals. While the MRC can and will be
encouraged to assist the Admissions
Office by acting as a support group
for the Student Recruitment Com-
mittee, the formal process of giving
tours and hosting prospective
students is best left in the hands of

2

Minorities needed —

 

Instead, the MRC should be respon-
sible for accentuating the positive
aspects of Washington and Lee. This
can be done on a personal level by
talking with the prospective minority
students or by revising current Ad-
missions Office publications that
deal with minorities.

In addition, after specific problems
have been identified, the Minority
Recruitment Committe should work
in conjunction with the Office of the
Dean of Students, specifically the
Dean of Minority Affairs, as well as

other student organizations (the '

Minority Student Association, for ex-
ample), in order to resolve these pro-
blems.

More likely than not, any resolu- |

tion to racial or similiar problems at

Washington and Lee will have to oc- ‘

cur through the education of the stu-
dent body and the community as a
whole. This is the real challenge.
The process of education, as in all
cases, will be difficult. People resist

all types of change, but they especial- :

ly resist the types that involve their

having to alter their perception and —

biases of other people. It is hard to
change a person’s attitude about
someone or something

when they

have held that view for most of their «

life. Often, this ingrained and tightly

held perception is what makes it dif- |
ficult for some people to interact |

minority students.

Yet this is exactly what the Minori-
ty Recruitment Committee and, in
fact, all of Washington and Lee must
set out to address and eventually
resolve. As members of the Universi-
ty community we should have a
definite interest in Washington and
Lee’s recruitment of minority
students; not only because it will bet-
ter our institution, but because it is

our responsibility as men and '

women.

LETTERS

Student says it does and will happen to us —

To the Editors:

With the tragedy of Daniel Martin’s death a
few weeks ago so vivid in our minds, it seems
somewhat redundant to be writing about the
brief instant in which all our lives can end.

One would think that Martin’s death would suf-
fice to give notice that our Washington and Lee
community does not exclude us from the reality
of the outside world. There were many who
hoped that Martin’s death make people stop and
think about how easily it can all end,

I, for one, was among those who had that invin-
cible attitude upon hearing of Martin’s death.
“Tt’ll never happen to me,”’ I said. I was right.

When I wrecked last week, I only got a concus-
sion and some stitches in my face. While lying in
a hospital bed in Roanoke a lot of things can go
running through your head. But after getting
over the shock, I began to wonder why I did not
think I could die.

I’m not sure there is an easy answer, but I
think the invincible attitude might be something
omnipresent among 18 to 22-year-olds. Look at
the lives we live. By attending one of the finest
universties to be found, we are afforded the in-
valuable opportunity to expand our minds in an
atmosphere of which most anyone would be en-
vious.

The thing is, we don’t need to do anything to en-
joy the W&L experience, or the college exper-
ience in general. Nothing except take care of
ourselves so we are alive to participate in it. It is
ours for the taking.

Because of this, we tend to get caught up in our
own little world here in Lexington and forget that
being here is the same as being anywhere else
when it comes to being in a car accident, or any
other accident. This attitude pervades us so
much, that even when someone dies, we don’t
really take it for what it is. A tragedy like that is
so foreign to us in our W&L environment we just
have a difficult time applying it to ourselves.
Hence, ‘‘It’ll never happen to me.”

This letter isn’t meant to be an exposé on the
way to live. I know some will read it and forget
about it. But, I hope others will see themselves

End of the ‘one line’ war?

To the Editors:

This year I have really enjoyed the intense
waging of wits, the cutting insights, the high
moral standards, and the well thought out and
defensible arguments that have been going into
the letters to the editor lately concering co-
education. I can’t believe that the war between
the ‘one line women’ and the snappy comeback
by another student made the editor’s page. Why
don’t we just give them crayons and let them
send coloring book pictures to the Phi? It would
be more colorful and they would not have to
spend so much time thinking up the brilliant
thoughts that characterize this useless running

war.

Junior dislikes new system

To the Editors:

I thank God for the new registration pro-
cedures: not because I approve, but because this
issue has aroused student opprobrium against
the administration. Although I have nothing but
respect for the registrar, I believe the new policy
is totally abhorrent to all the traditions of
Washington and Lee: it rewards classes on the
basis of luck rather than merit or forethought.

Under the old system, students wishing to
register for popular classes with an enrollment
limitation had to exhibit enough concern to see
the appropriate professor well in advance of
registration day. Now, the early bird only gets
the worm if he happens to be a senior.

The new system has already succeeded in clos-
ing freshmen out of many classes, and because
most require prerequisites, it can be difficult to
complete any schedule, let alone one that in-
terests the student. The administration seems
determined, as also shown in the excessively
severe General Educational Requirements, to
force students into classes in which they have no
interest.

Interest should be the primary factor in class
selection, especially in the student’s major area.
One student taking a course because nothing else
is offered should not be allowed to block out a
major, simply because the older student was in
line first.

These problems already exist, yet other, more
serious effects of this irresponsible policy can be
projected. As freshmen find it impossible to
schedule basic-level courses they need for the
General Education Requirements, more and
more courses will be reserved for them. This, in
turn, will require completion of the G.E.R. early,
because key courses will not be open to up-
perclassmen. Where will this leave double ma-
jors and business majors who often have to
spread out the distribution over four years in
order to take necessary courses in the major? As
soon as a freshmen enters Washington and Lee,
he will have to schedule his entire four years
here. There will be no room for error. There will
be no time for re-consideration of the major.
There will be fewer and fewer student freedoms,
as they fade in the shadow of the computer.

If this description sounds more like Penn State
than Washington and Lee, unfortunately, this is
no accident. The administration, through vastly
increased numbers of students in each suc-
ceeding class year, a tyrannical General Educa-
tion Requirement system, and greater emphasis
on publishing than teaching, is attempting to
alter the basic fabric of this school. As the years
go by, Washington and Lee will come to resem-
ble a huge, impersonal University more and
more if the present administration is allowed to
continue unchecked. We must resist this subver-
sion at every step, or the Washington and Lee we
know as a unique bastion of tradition and wisdom
will surely cease to exist.

Washington and Lee has no
plans to exceed the 1500-student
limit established by the Board of
Trustees in 1984.

Frank Parsons, assistant to
University President John D.
Wilson, said no plan exists to ex-
ceed that limit, and that should
such a plan be proposed, it would
be opposed by some members of
the board.

Recently, there has been
speculation among students that
the University would exceed 1500
undergraduates if it enrolls 420
freshmen in each of the coming
four years. But Dean of the Col-
lege John W. Elrod said simply
multiplying original class en-
rollments by four doesn’t give an

A figure which does take this in-
to account is the attrition rate,
which gives the percentage of the
originally enrolled freshmen who
have left the University. Using
figures supplied by the 1986-87
Washington and Lee University
Fact Book, the Ring-tum Phi took
the Fall Term enrollments from
the classes 1972-86 in each of their
years, freshmen through senior.
Each of these figures was then
taken as a percentage of their
original Fall Term freshman
enrollment; from each of these
percentages, an average class
enrollment percentage was deriv-
ed.

Greenpeace
More than a whale story

By MATHEW HORRIDGE
Staff Reporter

 

John C, Cook, whose work with the
Greenpeace organization has taken
him from Siberia to the Amazon
Basin, spoke to 150 people last Thurs-
day night in Lee Chapel.

Cook’s lecture centered on the en-
vironment protection group’s efforts
to clean up the world’s ecology. He
said Greenpeace has four major
areas of concentration: ecology
preservation, toxic waste clean-up,
nuclear waste clean-up, and the
preservation of marine animals,
especially whales.

He said it was time for the people of
the world to start thinking about their
interaction with the environment
before it is permanently damaged.

“The world really has to come to
terms with itself,’ he said. “The
geography doesn’t recognize any
political or social differences” be-
tween nations.

The Global Change Board is “try-
ing to predict the long-range changes
of the world”’ so that people can act
accordingly.

The Global Change Board is an in-
ternational organization made up of
scientists, scholars and environmen-
tal experts, Cook said.

Cook said that one of Greenpeace’s
major projects in the next few years
will be to stop the deforestation of the
tropical rain forests, a problem
especially bad in Central and South
America.

Greenpeace’s efforts to curb toxic-
waste dumping have been fairly suc-
cessful, Cook said.

The group’s members favorite tac-
tic for stopping companies from
dumping toxic waste into the en-
vironment is to block the end of the
pipes that carry the waste.

Cook said at one company that was
polluting the air with smoke, a
Greenpeace member parachuted
from a 400-foot smokestack. He said
the action drew the attention of the
local media and put pressure on that

average enrollment percentages,..
multiplied- by. an original Fresh-.,
man enrollment, would give a=»
“valid” total Fall Term enroll-
ment for each class. Using a
freshman enrollment figure of 420
students and totalling the final
class figures, this method pro-
duces a total Fall Term student
population of 1499.

Associate Director of Admis-
sions Daniel N. Murphy said the
University would seek to admit
approximately 420 freshmen in
Fall Term 1987, 290 men and 130
women. Each year, Murphy add-
ed, the Admissions Department
looks to attract the same number
of incoming students within a
general range.

Murphy said one consideration
for the number of freshmen the
university admits is the amount of
dormitory space available for
freshmen.

 

 

company to improve its waste-man-
agement system.

The media, he said, are Green-
peace’s greatest tool.

Greenpeace is opposed to nuclear
weapons, Cook said, not because of
ideology so much as the recognition
that weapons tests and deployment
hurt the environment as does the
disposal of spent fuels.

In 1985, the Greenpeace ship, the
Rainbow Warrior, was sunk by
French demolition experts, after the
group announced it would block a
French nuclear weapons test in the
South Pacific.

That incident brought Greenpeace
a lot of attention, and many people in
the audience asked about the event.

Cook said Greenpeace was disap-
pointed by the decision of the United
States not to continue the morator-
ium against nuclear weapons testing.

“The United States lost a real op-
portunity (to curb nuclear prolifera-
tion) on Feb. 3 of this year’’ when it
proceeded with a weapons test, Cook
said. The Soviet Union extended its
moratorium on weapons test three
times but, after Feb. 3, said it would
also resume tests.

Greenpeace was successful in stop-
ping the dumping of nuclear waste in-
to the Atlantic Ocean by appealing to
the dock workers of Europe not to
load the barrels of waste on ships,
Cook said.

Previously, ships would take the
barrels out to sea and dump them
along the ship’s course to a point ap-
proximately 400 miles southwest of
the Spanish coast, he said. Green-
peace members tried to prevent
crews from dumping barrels by driv-
ing inflatable boats under the crane
derricks.

Cook said by doing this the
Greenpeace members were forcing
the ships’ crews to make a decision
about whether or not it would be
worth it to drop a drum of waste on
another human being.

Most people associate Greenpeace
with saving whales, Cook said, and
the group has made great strides in

saving many species, especially the
humpbacked whale.

Five major countries — the Soviet
Union, Japan, South Korea, Sweden
and Norway — still have commercial
whale hunts, but the Soviet Union has
promised to end its whaling by the
end of this year and Japan has pro-
mised to end its by the end of 1988,
Cook said.

Cook said Greenpeace currently is
working to establish a base camp on
Antarctica — what he calls the
world’s “last unclaimed territory”
— for scientific observations. He said
Antarctica accurately reflects what
changes are happening in the world
because much of the atmosphere
passes over the polar region.

Cook concluded his lecture by tell-
ing of his experience on a trip to
block Soviet whaling off the Siberian
coast.

As the crew suspected, there was a
whaling station on the coast that
mainly was used to process whale
meat for mink food. The high blubber
content of whale meat brings out the
shine in the mink’s coat.

After filming the whaling station,
several members of the team, in-
cluding Cook, decided to take small
boats to the coast to pass out anti-
whaling literature to the village’s
fishermen.

The team members were arrested
by Soviet authorities, an arrest
witnessed by those on the Green-
peace ship. The ship’s crew decided
to try to get the film to Canada by
putting it and a man in an inflatable
boat. The boat was captured by a
Soviet helicopter, however, and the
crew thought the film was destroyed.

The dinghy crossed the ship’s path
about an hour later with the film still
aboard. Cook and his fellow pro-
testors were held for a week and then
released.

Cook’s lecture was sponsored by
Contact, a student committee that
brings speakers of national pro-
minence to the Washington and Lee
campus. Contact is funded by the In-
terfraternity Council and the Ex-
ecutive Committee.

More than 50 representatives from
Washington and Lee, Virginia Mil-
itary Institute and the Lexington
community have been invited to at-
tend a “town conversation’’ at the
University Center on Wednesday
afternoon.

The meeting, which will last from 4
p.m. to 7:30 p.m., is sponsored by
Kathekon, W&L’s  student-alumni

Minority recruitment meeting successful

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Assignments Editor

Providing housing for prospective
minority students and establishing
an alumni network were two of the
main goals expressed Monday night
by the organizers of a minority
recruitment group at Washington
and Lee.

“The main thing we want is diver-
sity,’ said Dana J. Bolden, a black
sophomore from Boyton Beach, F'la.,
at the group’s initial meeting. ‘Our
goal is not just to recruit black peo-

ple,” he said, noting the small
number of Hispanic and Jewish
students at W&L.

About 15 students, mostly white, at-
tended the hour-long meeting. Bolden
and co-organizer Thomas B. Brickel,
a white sophomore from Brentwood,
N.Y., discussed their goals and then
answered questions.

Brickel said he was pleased by both
the turnout and the discussion.

Two of those in attendance were
junior Mark L. Farley, who will chair
the Student Recruitment Committee
next year, and Assistant Director of
Admissions Mimi Milner Elrod.

Robinson speaks
on everyone’s fears

 

By MARGARET PIMBLETT
Staff Reporter

The fear of change prevents people
from developing and accepting new
ideas, said a nationally-known televi-
sion journalist last Thursday night.

Max Robinson, formerly a tri-
anchor for ABC’s World News
Tonight, spoke in duPont Audi-
torium. His visit was sponsored by
the Washington and Lee Minority
Student Association in honor of Black
History Month.

“We fear change, we fear same-
ness, we fear white people, we fear
black people, we fear women, we
fear men, we fear alphas, we fear
deltas,’’ said Robinson.

“We fear the past and have a
prayer of the future, and little taste
for the present.”

Robinson said that the past is fear-
some because Americans ‘‘have fail-
ed to understand their history.”’

He also said that the term ‘‘black
history’ does a disservice to blacks

heranece it kaanc them cenarate fram

whites, as though blacks were not
part of regular American history, but
instead must be treated as a different
entity.

Rather than deliver a prepared
speeck, Robinson spoke extempor-
aneously and answered questions
about topics ranging from self-love to
the Iran contra scandal to journalism
ethics.

He said that he used to have a pro-
blem with self-love, the ability to like
himself without conceit while ac-
knowledging his good traits.

“Self-love has one mortal enemy
—fear,’’ he said.

“The reason we have so much se-
parateness in this country is because
we fear each other.”

Robinson said that too many people
allow themselves to wear masks that
disguise their true identity, because
they do not love that identity

When asked about the Iran situa-
tion, he referred to it as ‘“‘Irangate,”’
but during later questioning admit-
ted that he had spoken hastily.

“It’s catchy,’ he said, which is
whw he thinks the term has been used

Farley and Elrod both stressed to
those in attendance that they should
consider applying for the Student
Recruitment Committee. But the two
also said in interviews that they
thought the minority recruitment
committee could be viable and im-
portant organization.

One of the group’s major jobs may
be to help increase the number of ap-
plications from minorities.

Elrod said that 53 minority stu-
dents applied to W&L last year.
Thirty-five were accepted, and six
enrolled. Farley suggested that the

notations.

He said the situation “is a major

that true scenarios can be good.

of government, or he does — and

and that it work to change that situa-
tion.

Farley said that the Student
Recruitment Committee would con-
tinue to handle all tours and
transportation, but that the minority
recruitment group could provide
housing and other assistance.

Elrod, who said she attended
because she was asked to do so by
students, stressed that the minority
recruitment group had no direct ties
to the admissions department.

“It is not part of the admissions of-
fice,’ she said. ‘‘It is student-run.”’

The problems with media coverage
of the crisis, he said, developed
because journalists tend to group and
attempt to show up their colleagues
on particular topics, while overlook-
ing other important stories.

by Joseph King, who took over as
Lexington’s city manager during the
summer. King wanted to know if
there was a precedent for such a
meeting, which there was.

The goal of the meeting is to ‘‘open
communications between the three
important constituencies in our com-
munity,” said Farrar, who would like
to see such gatherings held on an an-
nual or semi-annual basis.

The representatives will be en-
couraged to share ideas, concerns,
interestes and perceptions, Farrar
said. ‘‘We want it to be positive and
constructive.”

Farrar said he hoped the meeting
would promote understanding and
cooperations between the three
groups.

About 25 people have been invited
from W&L. Fifteen have been invited
from VMI, as well as 15 from the
community. The W&L representa-
tives include a number of deans, stu-
dent government members, student
media editors, and heads of
undergraduate and law school
organizations.

Many of the W&L representatives
are seniors because the heads of
clubs and organizations have not yet
been chosen. Farrar said he was
aware of this, but he wanted to hold
the meeting before spring term,
when W&L tends to be fragmented
because of the large number of
students who are off campus.

“This is an agenda-setting

meeting likely will be held in the fall.

Big Three officers speak on their duties

By BRAND ORGN
Vice President of the Executive
Committee

At this time, most students are fos-
mulating plans for Fancy Dress or
are desperately trying to finish up
papers and tests so they can make
the most of the weekend. Every stu-
dent should also be thinking about the
Big Three elections this coming Mon-
day.

In electing a vice president, keep in
mind that he is the treasurer of stu-
dent body funds and plays a crucial
role in determining how much each
organization receives. Through
scheduled budget hearings, the vice
president keeps a careful eye on how
each club spends its funds.

Another duty of the vice president
is serving as technical advisor to the
accused during an honor trial. He
answers questions about procedure
and accompanies the president when
he imforms a student that he has
been charged with a possible honor
violation.

The person you elect must be able
to work with peers, faculty, ad-
ministrators and alumni in a mature,

 

 

 

 

 

consuming job, especially during
honor proceedings when school work
takes a back seat to that of the Ex-
ecutive Committee.

Prior experience is not necessary,
but the vice president must be com-
mitted to the ideals of honor and
tradition at Washington and Lee. Be-
ing the second-highest student
government post on campus, it is not
a position to be taken lightly.

Serving as vice president has been
a rewarding experience. In closing, I
ask that you take time to look at the
candidates to determine who is best
qualified for the office considering
the statements made above.

Vote wisely!

| Robins: self-described man with a mission

By SEAN BUGG
Editor

 

Junior Rick Robins is running a
potentially controversial campaign
for president of the Executive Com-
mittee. The campaign concerns itself
with the “loss of the W&L gentle-
man’”’ since coeducation and the ad-
ministration’s deepening involve-
ment in student affairs.

“T’m dead serious when I say that I
feel the power needs to be shifted
toward the student body and away
from John Wilson and his bureau-
crats.”’

Robins thinks that the advent of

coeducation has brought an end to
the Washington and Lee gentleman.
He said this has resulted ‘‘not direct-
ly from coeducation, but the new type
of student which coeducation has at-
tracted. r

“The women may not favor it, but I
think that having been here for a
year or half-year, they will under-
stand and respect that viewpoint if
they are at all sensitive to the view-
point here,” said Robins.

Another issue Robins is concerned
about is sovereignty for the Inter-
fraternity Council. ‘I’m tired of the
administration deciding what is in
the best interests of the fraternities.”

Wood builds
honor platform

By JOHN PENSEC
News Editor

Brandt Wood doesn’t have one
specific reason why he is running for
president of the student body; he has
many, all joined by his committment
to the Honor System and confidence
in himself.

After two years on the Executive
Committee, Wood says he under-
stands what the duties of the presi-
dent are. He has had, he says, good
role models during his years on the
committee.

It is those years that have given
this junior, business administration
major a better understanding and ap-
preciation of the Honor System, a
system he is eager to support as
president. Prior E.C. experience is
necessary, in his opinion, because of
the exposure to trial and meeting
procedures that it affords.

In talking about the law school and
recent questioning of its relationship
with the undergraduate campus,
Wood says he thinks it would be a
mistake for there to be two separate
judicial systems. Two systems, he
says, would divide the schools, and
unity among the student body is im-
portant to Wood. He views the Honor
System as the most important link
between the two schools.

Law students, he says, are an in-
tegral part of the E.C. because of
their knowledge of certain pro-
cedures.

But unity is not the only thing of im-
portance to Wood. The single sanc-
tion is equally important.

“T would address all student con-
cerns with open discussions, but I
believe the privileges and freedoms
we enjoy would be in jeopardy with-
out the single sanction,”’ he said.

“If there were degrees of sanc-
tions, then trust would be in degrees.
Trust can not be measured by
degree. You either trust someone or
you don’t.’’

As president, Wood says he will be
committed to educating new students
to the facets of the Honor System and
to maintaining an awareness among
other students of why they are ac-
corded such freedoms.

“T believe I can help the Honor
System maintain its goals of strong
student support and unity within the
entire student body,” he said.

said, ‘‘He, like Wilson, has a habit of
taking the easy way out when con-
fronted with controversial issues. In-
stead of turning to constructive
educational methods to correct pro-
blems, he opts for restrictive rules
and regulations.”

Robins believes that the frater-
nities should be granted sovereignty,
to concentrate on projects such as

Brad Root thinks his experience as
a member of the Executive Commit-
tee sets him apart from the other
candidates for president of the stu-
dent body. The junior journalism ma-
jor from Erie, Pennsylvania is serv-
ing his second term as an E.C.
representative.

Root said that he has worked close-
ly with the past two presidents of the

Menon, and understands what is ex-

“‘prank thefts,”’

“Don’t get me wrong,” he said.
‘I'm not trying to come away at all
from the single sanction.” He thinks
the E.C. has “turned away” from the
issue in the pastpthough he noted the
recent E.C. letter to fraternities war-
ning against scavenger hunt thefts as
a positive sign.

Robins has been an IFC represen-
tative, a member of the Emergency
Loan Committee and Pledge Educa-
tor and Rush Chairman at the Sigma
Phi Epsilon social fraternity, as well
as having run his own seafood
business this summer.

He is a firm believer in the single
sanction and the Honor Systemas it
is now. To codify that system by:im-
plementing different sanctions’ for
different offenses would replace the
Honor System with a set of rules and
regulations. Root acknowledges that
the system is being questioned by
some students, especially in the law
school, but he thinks that to separate
the two schools by having different
honor systems “‘would be a crime in
itself.”

“We are all Washington and Lee
students,” he said. But Root did
acknowledge that law students are

The candidates were in favor of fin-
ding new ways for the SAB to use its
money.

“The budget the SAB has to work
with is unique,” said Junior Pat
Schaffer. He said they are given
money to cover losses, losses due
primarily to purposeful low ticket
prices and changes in the drinking
age.

Mark Davis, a second year law stu-
dent running said when you see
losses ‘‘that’s the time to change
your policy.”

Some of the suggestions from the
candidates included working with
smaller bands and better scheduling
taking into account fraternity par-
ties.

The candidates were also asked if
they felt the jurisdiction of the Honor
System applied outside the W&L
community, such as students at
home, at women’s colleges or on
fraternity activities.

Junior Mark Chiappara, a can-
didate for secretary, addressed the
issue of pledge scavanger hunts say-
ing, “‘I think frats should be informed

of the position they put thier pledges
in.”

In regards to so-called ‘prank
thefts’’ junior candidate for
secretary Tom O’Brien said, “the

E.C. has been unwilling in the past to
address the issue.” O’Brien noted
that the student generation deter-
mines honorable behavior and the
“E.C. is solely an interpretor...but
not an initiator.”’

All the candidates were asked what
they felt the state of the Honor
System was at W&L.

Normen Sigler, a junior candidate
for vice president, said, “The Honor
System has been strong...for hun-
dreds of years and it will continue to
be strong.”

Greg Dale, a sophomore candidate
for secretary, said the Honor System
“is going fairly well.’’ However, he
feels that there is a problem in that
“People just look at it as though you
should not lie, cheat or steal.” In-
stead, Dale believes that students
should make the system a part of
their lives.

One question from the audience
was directed solely to secretary can-

didate Pierson. She was asked if she

felt that her candidacy will be viewed
by students as a lack of commitment.
Pierson currently is secretary for the
Mock Convention.

“T’ve heard a lot of people talking
about that,” Pierson said. She said
she met with the executive commit-
tee of the Convention and they gave
her their support.

“T don’t see it as an opportunistic
type of thing,” Pierson said. “I hope
it’s not viewed as that.”’

The office of secretary completes

detrimental, Robins said, “I’m a

Robins controversial platform is
best condensed by him: ‘This is the

“It is important that
undergraduates at Washington and
Lee realize that the law school is not
a separate entity from the under-
graduate school nor do its students
want to be,” said Mark Davis, a sec-

ond year law student running for vice
president of the student body.

Davis is a member of the Student
Bar Association, and is president of
his class. He said that as a member
of an honor subcommittee during his
undergraduate years at the Universi-

with the tradition of honor that has
been continued with his education at
W&L, as well as with the single sanc-
tion system.

Junior Norman Sigler is running
for vice president of the Executive
Committee. While at Washington and
Lee, he has served on the Superdance
Committee and in high school was
the vice president of the Key Club,
the Spanish Club and the Science

beginning to ask questions about the

questioning the system is a good sign.

Sigler thinks there should be

E.C.

as intermediary

 

By TOM BRICKEL
Staff Reporter

Tom O’Brien, a junior politics ma-
jor from Cincinnati and candidate for
the position of secretary on the Ex-
ecutive Committee, stresses stu-
dent/administration relationships as
the most important issue facing the
E.C.

O’Brien, chairman of the Student
Telephone Union for two years and
member of Contact and the SAB,
says that in recent months, the rela-
tionship between the two bodies has
deteriorated “through a lack of
understanding on the part of both
parties.”

“The E.C. should serve as more of
an intermediary for both the student
body and the administration,”’
O’Brien said in an interview. “Its
success in effectively communi-
cating the viewpoint of the student
body is crucial to bettering the rela-
tionship between the two.”

O’Brien lists the enlargement of
the student body and the new
registration system as examples of
such miscommunication. “The stu-
dent body often feels it has lost its
voice in changes such as these. It is
the duty of the E.C. to relay student
input to the administration, and vice
versa, something where there is
always room for improvement.”’

‘“‘Many students didn’t know what
was going on with the registration
system, for example, causing them
many problems, like underclassmen
being unable to enroll in the classes
they wanted. Problems like these
could be ironed out by the E.C. com-
municating the changeover to the
students.”

Though it has come under fire in
the past, O’Brien lists the Honor
System as the strongest point of the
university. ‘“‘The need to instill the
belief in the Honor System in fresh-
men is still there. We are a unique
school in that the Honor Code re-

“Students at the law school see
more eye-to-eye with undergraduate
than they may think with regard to
the issues most important to the
University,’’ he said.

“Those students pushing for a
judicial enforcement system
separate from the E.C. in the law
school are part of a vocal minority
which have misrepresented the opi-
nion of the entire law school student
body.”

Davis thinks that the creation of
multiple sanctions to handle different
offenses is wrong because “it tells
people, from members of the com-
munity to future employers, that
Washington and Lee believes in
degrees of honor.”

“There can be no such thing as
degrees of honor within a system
such as ours. There is only one code,
and if anyone violates this, that per-
son does not deserve to be at this
school.”

Davis attributes the low number of
second year students believing in the
Honor System, as taken by a recent
survey, to the background of those
students, saying that most of the
schools from which they come have
“little or no working honor system.”’

“It has this factor, combined with
an E.C. orientation that could’ve
place more emphasis on the honor
code, that resulted in the low
number, and not a weakness in the
current Honor System,” he said.

Ultimately, Davis does not identify
himself solely as a law student, but
rather as “a member of the com-
munity of trust that envelopes
Washington and Lee.”

He added that ‘‘This community of
trust goes hand in hand with the
ethical consideration raised by the
Honor System. It is this bond that I
would hope to strengthen if elected to
the position of Executive Committee
vice presidert.”’

deMovellan ‘understands’

the budget and E.C. workings

Sophomre E.C. representative

Christopher deMovellan is running
for vice president of the Executive
Committee. Besides the experience
he has gained through representing
his class on this year’s committee,
deMovellan thinks that living on the
president of the E.C.’s hall last year
allowed him to “keep in touch with
the activities of the E.C.”’

By going over this year’s budget
with Vice President Brandt Surgner,
deMovellan has, in his opinion, been
able to “understand the format and
function of the budget and the time
commitments necessary for the posi-
tion of vice president.”’

deMovellan thinks ‘the Honor
System is doing very well,” and “‘the
E.C. needs to continue supporting the
same basic guidelines followed in the
past.” According to deMovellan
the Honor System ‘‘should be 100 per-
cent removed from the administra-
tion or faculty.’’ However, he added
that ‘the E.C. should work with the
faculty and they, in turn, should be
equally cooperative.’’ He is also in
favor of continuing the process of a
single sanction code. Commenting on
the concept of a student-run campus,
deMoveilan said, “‘the best way to
run a campus is to have the students
run it under the removed supervision
of the faculty.”” He added that he
while he thought all three candidates
were very qualified, in his opinion, he
is the “‘best of the three candidates.”’

mains strong after so many years.
The challenge facing the E.C. is to
ensure that it continues to work and
remain strong.”’

O’Brien admits that the school has
its weaknesses as well. ‘Besides the
lack of understanding between the
Hill and the students, there is a pro-
blem in the lack of closeness between
the law school and the undergraduate
school.”

“Where united effort is important
between the two schools, instead the
rift in the ravine has figuratively
widened. For example, the law
school has considered the option of its
own system of enforcing the Honor
System. While we are different
schools, we should remain one
university, something this option
overlooks.”

“In general,’ continued O’Brien,
“the students deserve an E.C. that is
not afraid to work for them. If elected
E.C. secretary, I hope to help the
E.C. achieve this end, encouraging
the administration to keep the
students in mind when making im-
portant decisions directly affecting
the entire student body.”’

 

Mark Chiappara, a junior account-
ing major from Upper Montclair,
New Jersey, and a candidate for the
position of Executive Committee
secretary, says that while many feel
the Honor System is in jeopardy,
qualitatively it continues to remain a
strong and effective part of Washing-
ton and Lee.

“People often measure the state of
the Honor System in terms of num-
bers — the number of honor violation
investigations and hearings, for ex-
ample,” said Chiappara at a forum
held for Big Three candidates yester-
day.
“But the efficiency of the Honor
System cannot be measured in this
manner. While there has been a
downward trend in the number of
honor violations, the strength of the
Honor System can be seen in the stu-

dent body’s adherence to it.”

Chiappara, a dorm counselor who
has participated on the diving and
rugby teams, says that the Honor
System is the most distinct charac-
teristic of Washington and Lee, and
has provided the motivation for him
torun for E.C. secretary.

“I would consider it an honor to
help continue and strengthen what
brought me to W&L; that is, the
Honor System. Having talked to cur-
rent members of the Executive Com-
mittee about the position of sec-
retary, I fully understand the duties
an am willing to put the time in that
would be required of the position.” -

Chiappara thinks that while E.C.
laws in the past with regard to the
jurisdiction of the honor code have
been liberal, that will no longer be
the case with future committees.
“Each case should continue to be
judged on its own individual merits;
however, students don’t realize how

serious the E.C. is about possible
honor violations, including those
pranks that in the past may have
been condoned.”’

Commenting on the possibility of
the creation of a separate judicial en-
forcement agency for the law school,
Chiappara stated that “there is no
reason for this.”

“The better the two schools are
able to act as a unified representa-
tion of Washington and Lee, the
stronger the Honor System will be, in
effect.”

The transition from an all-male
student body to a coeducated one was
one that “effected many positive
changes, though the extent of its
result remain to be seen,”’ he said.

“Academically and socially, the
school has improved, with women
becoming involved in all facets of the
university. But the results of coedu-

 

 

 

 

cation in the long run are hard to
determine. It will be interesting to
see if the unique identity the school
has had in the past will remain later.

By TOM BRICKEL

The Honor System is both the
University’s greatest strength and its
greatest weakness, and something
that the Executive Committee must
continually work to improve, accord-
ing to Greg Dale, a sophomore from
Medina, New York, and a candidate
for the position of EC secretary.

Dale, an English and History ma-
jor who has served as executive
director of College Republicans and
both secretary and treasurer of the
Inter-varsity Christian Fellowship,
says that the most important role of
the EC is to see that the Honor
System is not forgotten.

think about it, which hurts the
university and the students them-
selves. When students can both

Valerie Pierson understands there
are some real concerns facing the
E.C. in the next year. Those concerns
include the law school and its rela-
tionship to the Honor System as it is
now.

This sophomore, politics major
from Greensboro, North Carolina is
committed to the Honor System and
thinks she can address those issues.
That is why she is running for
secretary of the student body.

“There is a rift right now between
tae law school and undergraduates,”’
she said. “They (law students) are

not happy. I think the problem lies in
the procedural aspects of the honor
trial system. The solution is going to
depend on the law students.

“Tf they have such strong negative
feelings about the Honor System, it
must be a concern of the E.C.’s,”’ she
said.

Pierson served on the jury of a re-
cent honor trial. She credits that ex-
perience with bringing home how
much of a direct impact the system
has on the lives of W&L students. But
it is a system she believes in, and she
fully supports the single sanction.

Pierson thinks the administration
may have made too much of an effort
to help the women assimilate, and
she says she understands how the

Honor to be a way of

System and understand it, they are
able to appreciate it further.’

“In effect, the Honor System, often
considered the strongest point of the
university, becomes its weakest
point when people no longer under-
stand why they believe in it. It should
not be just a system, but a way of life
for those who do live within its
guidelines.”’

On the recent debate over the
merits of, coeducation, Dale says
that, while animosity will continue to
exist between those divided over the
issue, coeducation ‘‘has for the most
part been accepted by the student
body.

“Granted, people will continually
point to coeducation as a break with
tradition that hurt the university.
However, the move was a positive
one that in the long and short run will
only serve to strengthen the school.
Change does not necessarily mean
destruction of tradition, especially in
this case,” Dale commented.

Last year, the creation of the posi-
tions of female and minority ad hoc

members to the EC was suggested,
suggestions Dale says he under-
stands, but does not support. ‘‘The
EC was meant to represent the entire
student body, not just separate
groups within it. While the voice of
women and minorities must be heard
and presented by the EC, it would
enhance the unity the EC represents
if those students worked through the
system, instead of separating
themselves from it,” said Dale.

“The creation of ad hoc members
not only does this, but creates the ad-
ditional problem of setting a prece-
dent for groups within the student
body being guaranteed a position on
the EC. In the long run, these groups
will most likely be represented by the
existing executive committee.”’

Of particular importance, says
Dale, is the unity of both the law
school and the undergraduate school.
“There is a very real division be-
tween the two schools, one that is un-
fortunate when you think of the ad-
vantages both could derive in learn-
ing from each other,” said Dale.

people who don’t support coeducation
feel. But she said, “‘All you can do is
make the best of it.”

“They had good intentions that
were not well received by the
students,” she said. “It left the
women in a difficult position.”’

Pierson was recently appointed
secretary of the 1988 Mock
Democratic Convention. She said she
talked with others on the conven-
tion’s steering committee and that
they encouraged her torun.

All in all, however, this dorm
counselor and tennis player says she
is going into this with her eyes open.
“T think I can do a good job,” she
said. ‘I can only hope that everyone
will give me a chance.”

and a new school record as well.
Right behind Murray was sophomore
James Ambrosini, who placed sec-

three feet better than his previous
personal best.

Aldridge said that John Burl-

we want to win as much as we can. That’s why you play to win.

; For the past few years, the Washington and Lee baseball team has been in
a State of turmoil under the fiesty reign of former head coach Jim Murdock.
The Generals have suffered through five consecutive losing seasons,
finishing no better than fifth in the Old Dominion Athletic Conference. Jeff
Stickley wants to change all of that.

; ‘‘Stick’’, who has been coaching baseball as well as football off and on
since he was 17 years old, brings to the Generals a completely different
coaching style. Compared to the intense Murdock, Stickley, an assistant
football coach at W&L, is extremely calm and laid back. He attributes his
style to the many coaches he worked with and played under.

‘‘Lcoach the way I'd want to be coached,” he said. “‘I try to use the style of
people who have coached me and I’ve been lucky enough to have some good
nes.

“It depends too on the sport. Football is a more emotional sport and you
eally have to play on your emotions. Baseball is more of a sport where you
vant to keep an even keel because you play so many more games,” he said.

The monotony of practice is also one of Stickley’s major concerns. The last

hing he wants is for his players to start ‘‘dreading’’ practice and losing their
»nthusiasm for the sport.

As the head coach, Stickley is not afraid to admit fault. Then again, he is
not exactly willing to accept all the blame, either.

“I’m going to make mistakes. Everybody makes them. I’m going to do the
best I can and sometimes it’s going to make someone mad and they are not
going to like it. But, they are going to do some things to make me mad, so
we'll hang in there together.”

Stickley pointed out that the team’s main goal this season is to win the con-
ference. A winning season may be unattainable, said Stickley, due to the
caliber of the General’s nonleague opponents.

As for his assessment of the team at this stage of the season, Stickley was
pleased with all areas except the development of the pitchers. The lack of
practice time outside is the cause of this problem.

“Inside, you can throw off your wooden mounds and what you want,”’ he
said, ‘‘but it is a lot different outside.”

The squad’s attitude and work ethic has also been much to the coach’s lik-
ing.

“The attitude has been pretty good and I put a lot of stock into that,”
Stickley said. ‘‘I think we’ll surprise some people simply because a lot of
guys have a lot of experience and have played a lot. So we'll see.

The Generals play host to West Virginia Tech in a doubleheader on Satur-
day. Gametime is 1 p.m. at Smith Field.

fense and defense and appeared to
tire.

“We tried two different types of
defense,” said Daly, ‘“‘and they took
advantage of both.

“So we went to a defense that
would isolate their men, so Churchy
{senior goalie John Church] would
always know where the shots were
going to come from, since all the
other men would be covered.”

Daly continued, ‘‘We didn’t control
the ball well on offense, we would
bring it right down and score, and, of
course, that’s good.

“But because of that we were
spending a lot of time on defense and
our people began to get tired.’’

The Cavaliers put the game nearly
out of reach for the Generals when, in
a 52-second span early in the fourth
quarter, Virginia scored three goals.
W&L immediately called a time out
and appeared to have solved the pro-
blem, but it would have been nearly
impossible to catch up at that point.

“It was just a little break,’’ said
Daly of the time out. “‘A ‘thanks, I
needed that’ type of thing.

Jeff Stickley

“We just wanted to settle down and
play our type of game again.”

Junior midfielder Robbie Stanton
kept the Generals in the game early,
scoring three of W&L’s five first half
goals, and four of it’s first seven.

“Robbie just played a super
game,” said Daly.

Daly also said he was plesed with
the play of the entire defensive corps
in general and the outside defense-
men and midfielders in particular.
He said that he thought they did an
excellent job of controlling their men
one on one.

“Overall, we played well, and very
aggressively,”’ said Daly. ‘‘We were
going after the ground balls and we
played with the intensity we need-
ed.”’

Looking ahead, Fancy Dress Week-
end will bring a couple of firsts for
the Generals — their first game ever
against the Lynchburg varsity team,

as well as their first ever Old Domi-
nion Athletic Conference game.

Andrew White

By JOHN PACKETT
Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee tri-captain
Andrew White was named the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference In-
door Track Runner of the Year,
ee
Week.

“I felt really honored and sur-
prised by the whole event,” said
White.

White’s effort helped the
Generals win the team title at last
weekend’s ODAC Indoor Track
Championships at VMI.

The team thought the meet
would be a lot closer than their 48
point margin of victory, said
White.

White competed in the 55-meter
high hurdles, the 400-meter relay,
the 400-meter dash, and the 1600-
meter relay.

He won the 55-meter hurdles by
defeating John Williams of Lynch-
burg, who had beaten White
earlier in the year. White’s time of

7.9 seconds tied the conference in-

door record.

White placed second in the 400-
meter dash.

In the relays, he helped the
teams place first in the 400-meter
and third in the 1600-meter.

White has high hopes for his and
the team’s performances in the
upcoming outdoor season.

“Everyone on the team is work-
ing hard, and the younger runners
are coming along really well,”
said White.

“Trun a lot better in the outdoor
season because it is a longer
distance [in each lap] and it
makes it easier for me to gain
momentum.”

According to White, he needs to
cut two tenths of a second off his

outdoor time to become an all-

American.

White is an economics major
with a 3.72 GPA. He is a member
of Omicron Delta Kappa, an
honorary leadership fraternity.

Midler rescues ‘Fortune’

 

By MICHAEL TUGGLE
Movie Critic

 

With Bette Midler and Shelley
Long on the wings of the new comedy
Outrageous Fortune, one would expect
the film to take off. Instead, the film
rides up and down, ever threatening
to crash and burn with Midler acting
as its only salvation.

The story involves two “‘profes-
sional’ actresses. One is a serious
actress (Long) who knows every
great soliloquy ever written, while
the other (Midler) refers to
Shakespeare as ‘‘Bill’’ and wants to
know who the hell “‘Hamlet”’ is. Both
land into a two thousand dollar acting
seminar with one of the premier ac-
ting coaches in the world. O.K. Both
get involved with the same guy and
fall in love. O.K. One afternoon, the
guy walks into a building and Long
subsequently watches it explode.
Both lovers head for the mortuary,
where they confront each other for
the first time as love rivals. They
insist on identifying the body
and discover that (surprise!) the
doctors have the wrong body.

At this point, normal people return
to “‘life before the missing exploded
lover,’ but not these’ two.
They track him down at the airport
just as he is leaving and then fly all
over the country in an attempt to pin
him down When they eventually do

“You should see the dress I found,
it’s gorgeous...No, I don’t have a date
yet...I’ll get one, don’t worry! I’ve
still got a week left and I AM GOING
to Fancy Dress!”

Yes, it’s that time of the year again
— the famous ist-minute rush when
friends-of-friends and high school
boyfriends. are resurrected to escort
students to the biggest party of the
year — Fancy Dress. As the day
draws closer, standards lower — tall,
dark and handsome turns into some-
one who eats with utensils and bathes
regularly. Many people seem to think
of FD as a do-or-die affair — either
you DO goor you DIK of humiliation.

Getting a date for FD is on people’s
minds almost from Orientation week,
but the issue really heats up around
mid-January. Girls who hate parties
start dressing up and going out every
Wednesday, Friday and Saturday
night, sizing up every male they meet
according to availability and GQ quo-
tient.

What do women — from W&L and
surrounding colleges — think of FD?
One hears a variety of opinions.
From a student at a local women’s
college: “FD? Oh, you mean the
Fancy Dress Ball? Is that some time
soon?” From a W&L student: ‘‘Fan-
cy Dress is special if you have some-
one special. I wouldn’t go with just
anyone.”’ From yet another W&L stu-
dent: “Just find somebody you can

catch up with him, he threatens to
kill them (a huge chafe, after spend-
ing thousands of dollars trying to find
him).

You see, Mr. Explosion, as weil as
the acting coach, are really Russian
spies, and they have managed to
steal a top secret serum from the
government by using the women as
carriers for messages. The re-
mainder of the film is spent in chase,
as the women pursue the KGB and
steal the serum back, and vice versa.

To make a long story short, this
film is not very intelligent and not
very funny. Pristine Shelley Long is a
good foil to Midler’s foul-mouthed
character, but she does tend to
overact. As for the KGB agents, they
don’t come close. John Schuck, who
you may remember from the sitcoms
of the 70’s, still can’t act and is still
not funny.

Last week’s Time magazine donned
Midler on the cover with the
headline, ‘You Bette!’’ The piece
reinstated what everyone else has
already realized: Bette Midler has
finally made the Big Time. She again
proves in Outrageous Fortune as she
did in her last two comedy hits, Down
and Out in Bevery Hills and Ruthless
People, that she is hilarious and has
the ability to make a movie work.

Midler is great, George Carlin, asa

Aquarius, is good, and Long is

And from still another W&L female:

Little Saints big on talent

 

By MICHAEL TUGGLE
Entertainment Editor

 

While the Hoodoo Gurus may be
taking center stage in the small gym
of Doremus at Friday night’s Fancy
Dress Ball, you can be assured that
the warm up band, ‘‘the south’s
favorite’, Little Saints, will indeed
create some heat of their own. The
four year old band from Nashville,
Tennessee returns to Lexington Fri-
day night following a recent 50 week
tour to bring their mix of original and
cover music to the Fancy Dress ex-
travaganza.

The Little Saints quintet, Jeff
Holmes, Scot Evans, Randy Parsons,
Greg Eicnaugle, and Freeman
D’Angelo, has quite a varied repor-
toire, but one that always electrifies
the crows they play for. U2, Talking
Heads, and R.E.M. are the band’s
favorite and most heavily played
tunes, but other favorites like Spring-
steen, the Clash, the Violent Fem-
mes, and the Ramones are sure to
surface before the night is over. And
for the die hard Saints fans, not to
worry. With a Little Saints album set
for possible release this spring,

    

originals like ‘‘Girls Who Don’t Wear
Jewelry”, ‘‘Get Inside’, and “Great
Big Hands” will not be left aside.

For those of you that have never
seen Little Saints, let their reputation
precede them; they are crowd
pleasers. Their show is energetic,
