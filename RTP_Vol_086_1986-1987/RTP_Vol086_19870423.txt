Deja vu, as the floods strike again.

Leaks and clogs reign

By STACY MORRISON
Staff Reporter

 

 

 

The heavy rains that fell upon the
Lexington area last week did not
cause extensive damages, said
Harold L. Conklin of the Rockbridge
County Department of Parks and Ad-
ministration. ‘‘Mostly, there was just
a lot of debris that had to be cleared.
The flooding was minimal,”’ he add-
ed. The water came up over the roads
by Rockbridge Bay and Furr’s Mill,
elaborated Conklin.

Lexington City Manager Joe King
also said that the damage was

A Washington and Lee professor
who specializes on the history of the
papacy has taken issue with recent
attempts to compare the current feud
among television evangelists with
battles between secular leaders and
popes during the Middle Ages.

“It’s the most idiotic comparison
that could be made,” said Jefferson
Davis Futch III, professor of history.
“It’s the most comical analogy I’ve
ever seen attempted.”

Futch was referring to a statement
attributed to Jim Bakker’s attorney
Norman Roy Grutman, who was
quoted as saying, ‘‘It was like this in
the time of the Holy Roman Empire
and such power struggles were true
in days of the medieval popes.’’

Bakker gained national attention
when he resigned as head of the PTL
ministry in the midst of a sexual
misconduct scandal. His lawyer later
alleged that rival evangelist Jimmy
Swaggart was seeking to take over
the ministry.

“There were struggles involving
the medieval papacy,’”’ Futch con-
ceded, ‘‘but other, less frivolous
issues were at stake. There’s no
parallel at all.

“T think that these evangelists are
con artists who care nothing about
religion. In the Middle Ages religion
was taken seriously by everyone.

minimal. ‘‘There was no damage
beyond a few flooded basements due
to runoff from yards and streets.
Also, some private bridges were
washed away, and some streets were
temporarily blocked due to flood-
ing,” King said.

There were no problems at Goshen
Pass, Conklin said, adding that the
flood of November ’85 occurred after
approximately 11 inches of rain had
fallen. Conklin approximated that on-
ly six to seven inches fell this week in
rains that started Tuesday and con-
tinued on and off for three days.

“Some houses were evacuated in

measure, but that happened more
because they were shell-shocked
from last year’s floods,’ Conklin
said

As for the effects of the rain on
Washington and Lee, W. Scott Beebe,
assistant superintendent of Buildings
and Grounds, said the only damages
were ‘‘minor roof leaks and clogged
drains — the same things that hap-
pen with every heavy rain.”’ He add-
ed that the rains were “hard, not
severe like the flood rains last year.
We at B&G just handled it like a nor-
mal heavy rain. It really wasn’t
much like November '85."’

Something as ludicrous as_ this
episode would never have occurred
then, and the very effort to draw a
comparison only makes it clearer
how little there is in common,
“That’s not to say the medieval

ed. ‘There were plenty of controver-
sies, often revolving around money.
The difference is that the popes of the

Hooks and dogs

Hartog ploughs through applications

News

 

Hooks and dogs.

They were the kiss of death at
Washington and Lee University this
year.

The young man from Minnesota,
for instance, had one vote to accept
him and one to wait and see his latest
senior grades.

“He’s OK,” William Hartog, W&L
admissions director, commented to
his associates as he casually glanced
through the young man’s file.

Then something caught his eye like
a sharp stick.

“Oh, lots of hooks and dogs,’ he
said, a hint of distress in his tone.
‘‘He’s out. Not a Washington and Lee
transcript.”

Hooks and dogs. College admis-
sions talk for C’s and D's

Top students don’t make C’s, Har-
tog said. He scribbled his initials on
the ‘“‘Reject’’ line inside the folder
and tossed it to the floor. It landed
with a gentle plop next to his left foot.

The reject pile grew with the files
of high school students whose scores
were too low, whose grades had too
many C’s, whose high ability scores
and spotty grades indicated a lack of
motivation.

Underachievers. Everyone groan-
ed. W&L didn’t need them this year,
thanks.

“T can’t stand underachievers,”’
Hartog said. ‘‘I love to take a chance
on a kid who works hard and pro-
duces.”’

Hartog picked up another folder
The record showed the applicant was
making a surge in his senior year.
Everyone had read it and the name
was familiar.

“TL, TL,’’ someone said. ‘Too lit-
tle, too late.”

of European politics. They habitually
dealt with kings and emperors all the
time.”’

Futch continued, ‘These evan-
gelists are on the periphery, and they
deal with the ignorant and the
superstitious. The great and power-
ful of the world don’t pay any atten-
tion to them. The popes were indeed
money-grubbers, but they were at
the heart of everything.”’

Scribble, scribble, plop.

But Hartog and his colleagues
could hardly contain their glee when
a file of a senior who had it all — high
scores, top grades in tough courses,
special talents and leadership
—crossed their desks.

They realized that many of the best
students also had applied to the
University of Virginia, the College of
William and Mary, Harvard, Prince-
ton, Duke and many other
prestigious and selective schools also
salivating over these academic
records.

“What you don’t know is how many
colleges an applicant has applied to,”
Hartog said as he and his staff began
reviewing stacks of applications in
January. “Of course, the stronger
the candidate, the more options he
has. We’re loaded. We have tons of
very able kids.”’

GPAs not

reliable

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Assignments Editor

 

If you just made the honor roll for
the first time in your life or saw your
academic eligibility go down the
drain when you read your Winter
Term report card, you'd better look
again.

The term and cumulative grade-
point averages on the Winter Term
grade reports are unreliable, accord-
ing to Washington and Lee Registrar
Scott Dittman.

Letter grades on the report cards
are accurate, Dittman said.

“The printed grade reports are
reliable only for individual course
grades for the term,’’ Dittman wrote
in an April 16 memorandum to
parents, students, faculty and staff.
“Total credits and grade-point
averages, both term and cumulative,
are not accurate and should not be
used for any determination of
eligibility or honors. When the com-

Old batch

puter problem is identified and fixed,
grade-point averages, ranks and
honors will be recalculated and
distributed.”’

The problem was caused by a new
edition of W&L’s computer software,
which the school received in January
from the Datatel Corp. of Arlington,
Dittman said.

“‘We know how to fix it and we are
able to fix it, but we want to know
why it happened,”’ Dittman said.

Dittman first became aware of the
problem last Wednesday, when
Robert L. Powley, a junior from Glen
Rock, N.J., noticed a discrepancy on
his grade report.

Students who want to recalculate
their cumulative grades should
check their Fall Term grade reports,
which are accurate, Dittman said.

New grade reports will not be
printed up because the registrar’s of
fice has no more grade-report forms,
Dittman said. He did not know when
the corrected information would be
made available.

From Staff Reports

 

Registration for fall classes at
Washington and Lee University will
again utilize the batch method of
course sectioning. The on-line com-
puter registration system, tried for
the first time in February for spring
registration, will not be used.

“T believe an on-line system can be
developed to meet W&L’s needs,”
said D. Scott Dittman, university
registrar, ‘‘but at this time it is more
important to minimize the frustra-
tion and unhappiness felt by some
students and faculty members.
There is simply not enough time be-
tween now and May 4 to solve some of
the problems with on-line registra-
tion. The system we will use is the
one with which students and faculty
are most familiar.”’

Registration for the fall term will
be May 4.

Dittman said he met with the facul
ty Registration and Class Schedules
Committee, the faculty Executive
Committee, the student body Ex
ecutive Committee, and the chair
men of the academic departments to
discuss the registration situation
The discussions with those groups,
Dittman said, led to the conclusion
that the on-line system ‘challenged
our notions of how registration
should be accomplished.”

“The February registration was
always intended as a trial run of the
system, to understand how a dif-
ferent system might work and what
issues might be raised by having a
computer do more of the clerical or
technical work,’’ he said. ‘The test
provided us with much-needed evi-
dence for planning how many
courses should be offered and how
enrollments might be limited.”’

Additional information for fall
registration should be available to
students by May 1.

Hartog cites mistakes

in story

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Assignments Editor

 

This week’s Phi includes two
lengthy articles about Washington
and Lee’s admissions process. The
articles, which have been reprinted
from the April 5 issue of the
{Roanoke Times & World-News],
give a fairly accurate description of
Washington and Lee’s admissions
process, according to William Har-
tog, director of admissions at W&L.

Hartog did say, however, that he
thought the articles made the admis-
sions staff seem rather glib and ar-
rogant. He also cited two factual er-
rors that were in the original articles.

According to the original stories,
there are fewer Jews than blacks at
WA&L. That is incorrect.

The stories also implied that the
sons and daughters of alumni — who
are known as legacies — have little
chance of being admitted if they are
placed on the wait list. That is not
true. Hartog said that if a legacy on
the wait list tells the admissions of-
fice that W&L is his or her first
choice, then that student will be ad-
mitted automatically. That is not the
case for non-legacies.

Legacies, minorities and Rock-
bridge County residents all are con-
sidered outside of the normal admis-
sions pool, Hartog said. They are in
special categories created by the
board of trustees.

He said that of the 194 sons and
daughters of alumni who applied this
year, 106 were admitted. Legacies
have about twice as good a chance of
being accepted as non-legacies.

W&L has accepted 29 of 43 minority
applications, and three of four ap
plications from Rockbridge County
residents.

Hartog had mostly compliments
for Roanoke reporter Jack Chamber-
lain, who sat in on admissions
meetings almost weekly from
January through March.

Hartog said Chamberlain ‘saw
everything. We didn’t shield a thing
from him.”

But he also said the articles may
have provided too simplistic a view
of the admissions process. Readers
may have regarded the decisions as
having been made after only cursory
glances at the files.

“In some instances we were por
trayed as rather glib,’’ Hartog said

“Jack witnessed the weekly
culmination of an extraordinary
review. What Jack didn’t do was
carry the files home with us every
night and every weekend.”’

Chamberlain was on vacation this
week and could not be reached for
comment.

Hartog said the articles were
especially good because they gave
current high school students the
chance to look inside an admissions
office and showed them what an ex
tremely competitive admissions of
fice would require,

“Local residents have reacted very
positively toit,”’ Hartog said.

He said one of the most important
statistics included in the articles was
that W&L rejected 47 percent of the
applicants with verbal SAT scores
above 600 and 57 percent of those with
math scores above 600. This shows
that W&L is concerned about more

Shhhhhhhhh

Judging from the state of the University Library during
winter term exams, Washington and Lee seems to have a
new “‘party barn.”’

During a week that should be devoted to serious study by
most students, the library became a social hide-a-way.
Wherever one tried to study the combined vocal efforts of
numerous people became a roar that made concentration for
study nearly impossible. This was not conduct one would ex-
pect from ‘honorable’ W&L students.

Although there are some private rooms for student’s use,
there are not enough of them to handle the demand when
finals week comes around. Therefore, students have to de-
pend on the library as a quiet academic retreat. It is rude, un-
fair and ridiculous for other students to interfere with some-
one’s studies.

The university needs to find ways to control student con-
duct in the library. Hopefully a solution, less drastic than
library proctors or the end of 24 hour access, will be found
before the next finals period begins.

Even though one can hope for an end to obtrusive noise in
the library, one must realize that until students act maturely,
the problem will continue. One would think that at a school
that places such a high priority on honor, maturity would be a
prerequisite.

Misrepresentation

Each year during orientation, freshmen learn about the
Honor System from E.C. members during a special meeting.
The new W&L students are encouraged to ask questions. In-
vary someone asks, “‘Is using a fake I.D. an honor viola-
tion?”’

When the Class of 1989, now in their sophomore year, asked
that question, they were met with another question: ‘“‘Do you
think it would be one?”’ Students were advised that if they

need to ask if something is an honor violation, they were bet-
ter off not doing it.

When this year’s freshman class asked that question, it
was told that any instances of W&L students using fake I.D.s
would be investigated as a possible honor violation.

The White Book suggests examples of dishonorable
behavior as lying, cheating and stealing. The very name
“fake I.D.” suggests lying or fraud. One who uses a fake I.D.
is misrepresenting himself. This is clearly lying.

We do not suggest that drinking under age or being served
alcohol although the drinker is not yet 21 is an honor viola-
tion. However, using a fake I.D. or verbally lying about one’s
age goes against the honor code.

Students at W&L pride themselves on their honor, but they
must realize one cannot be honorable only on certain occas-
sions or in certain places. Honor is a way of life, not
something to be put on when we reach campus and taken off
before we enter a bar or go on vacation.

Mr. Robins, will you please give us

berated us with your arguments for
turning back the clock and returning

A ‘gentleman’ is defined

 

MY VIEW
By Steve Baldridge

 

I have been troubled this year. As
we talk about the future of our school,
it seems that we are failing to ad-
dress an issue of utmost importance.
We glibly toss out the words
“rights,”’ “traditions,” and ‘‘Honor
System” without examining their
meanings or implications to our-
selves and future students. Most cen-
tral to the issue is the question,
“What is a gentleman (or a lady)?”

I imagine a gentleman as having
certain basic traits. He would be no-
ble — kind and courageous. As
Robert E. Lee envisioned him, he
must be honorable. And, as we can
all agree, he is an ideal. Still, that vi-
sion of an ideal man has spawned a
tradition. One to which I question our
faithfulness.

Nobility results from the con-
vergence of ideals and self-dis-
cipline. Do we have either? The white
book states explicitly that “If you do
not believe in honorable conduct or
are indifferent on the point, W&L is
not the proper school for you.”

Kant held that human beings are
distinguishable from other life
because we can conceive and follow
moral principles. Honor is based on
that ability. But I don’t see how we
can call ourselves honorable or
moral and routinely participate in il-
legal activities. It’s inconsistent to
say one is honorable and serve
alcohol to minors. It’s  in-

quest signatures on a petition you
planned to present to the Board of
Trustees. The reaction to what you
called a “‘tremendous opportunity”
seems to have been lukewarm at
best. Again, you appear to be quite
alone in your thinking.

How can you believe that the Board
of Trustees would consider your peti-
tion at all? The Trustees encountered
great outcry from the alumni, yet
went ahead with their decision on
coeducation anyway. I can’t believe
that after having decided to dis-
regard their alumni (a principal
means of financial support);” that
they would reverse their ision
because of the opinions of a few
disgruntled students.

You mention the success of
Washington and Lee graduates and
then point proudly to the fact that
they came from an all-male institu-
tion. Mr. Robins, they also came
from an institution that had Saturday
classes, shorter vacations, tighter

consistent to say one is moral and
drink under age. It’s inconsistent to
say one is honorable and use recrea-
tional drugs. I realize that the moral
and legal do not always coincide. It is
my view that moral behavior,
honorable behavior, goes beyond
legal strictures. Such is implied by
the Founding Fathers’ opinion that
the Constitution could only govern a
moral people and no other kind. By
extension, I feel it is inconsistent to
call oneself a gentleman and manipu-
late or mistreat a young woman.
These same norms hold true for the
appellation of a ‘“‘lady.””

It is not my intention to lambaste
anyone. Rather, I hope that we will
ask ourselves if our actions reflect
gentlemanly ideals and be willing to
change if they do not. I fully realize
that I am not the best judge of anyone
but myself since I am not omniscient.
Nevertheless, I am opposed to the
narrow focus on students’ rights
without looking at the other side of
the seesaw — the side on which rest
student responsibilities. Rights can-
not exist without responsibilities.
Any tightening of restrictions stems
from a lack of confidence in the con-
trolled party’s execution of his or her
responsibilities. As a corollary,
restrictions are slackened when the
controlled party proves himself
capable of correct or wise decisions.
Instead of bemoaning the Hill’s in-
tervention in student activities, let’s
work to show ourselves responsible,
both as individuals and as a whole.

I also mentioned kind and
courageous as attributes of our
mythological beast — the ‘‘gentle-

strict parietals. Do you want to turn
the clock back to those times as well?
Or just to the point you and your
friends want?

I came to Washington and Lee for
many reasons. I felt that the
academics were strong and would
enable me to receive an excellent
education. Also, I knew the school
was rich with tradition. Believe it or
not, Mr. Robins, I too enjoyed the
camaraderie of an all-male institu-
tion.. 1

Yet, our class, the class of 1988,
was the product of a declining appli-
cant pool. As a whole, the class’s
academic capabilities were weaker
than usual. Yes, Mr. Robins, Wash-
ington and Lee was rich with the
tradition you adore, but it was also on
its way toward becoming a second-
rate academic institution. Coeduca-
tion, like it or not, has fortunately
prevented that from coming to pass.

You often ascribe your manner of

tian background, as did bot!
Washington and Lee, I don’t feel tha

self-sacrifice and a sensitivity t
others’ needs and opinions. This 1:
the kind of love that will weed ou
prejudice and hauteur in an atmos

W&L’s. In addition to kindness, we
must nurture courage. If indeed we
are honorable, then that is all we lack
to, as Ayn Rand put it, do what we
really want. Virtuous people have the
self-imposed obligation to remain
stalwart against opposition to their
heartfelt convictions. Let us befriend
that better self within each of us.

This is not an invitation to the open-
ing day of a witch hunt. More
accurately, it is a plea for the W&L
community to be true to ourselves
and to that tradition that sets
Washington and Lee apart as more
than a conferrer of diplomas. It
would be silly to disclaim personal
responsibility to the Honor System
and pretend a justifiable claim on
W&L’s reputation of producing wel)
educated gentlemen of sterling
character. It has been said that W&L
leaves an indelible mark on its
graduates. I believe that some of the
reasons can be found, even if im-
perfectly stated, in this letter. We
have much to look forward to — and
much to look back upon. Non incautus

the elusive ideal of the W&l
gentleman (and lady), and not for-
sake the legacy and vision — the sou!

Robert E. Lee. Can you honestly
argue that President Lee would have
preferred for W&L to sacrifice
academics to preserve the Universi-
ty as an all-male institution? Presi-
dent Lee’s ideals extend beyond the
concept of single-sex institutions
Why can you not understand that?
Honor and everything else to which
you constantly refer, exist whether
Washington and Lee is all male or co-
ed. What gives men a monopoly on
honor? Do they have special genes”,
Perhaps something carried on the Y
chromosome?

Mr. Robins, your battle is over.
You have fought valiantly, but your
cause is lost. Accept it. The windmill
has knocked you from your horse.

Daly requests crowd support for lax game

Dear W&L students, faculty and staff:

On behalf of the 1987 Generals Lacrosse Team,
I want to thank you for your cooperation and sup-
port when we played UVA at Glen Maury and for
your continued support through all of our first
seven home games.

I am writing to ask as many of you as possible
to attend the Generals’ last regular season home
game versus Roanoke on Wednesday, April 29 at
3:00 p.m. on Wilson Field. Not only will this
game determine the 1987 ODAC Lacrosse Cham-
pion, it will determine the site of W&L’s first
round tournament game.

The NCAA determines sites for Division III
Lacrosse Tournament games based on the
criteria of

1) quality of facilities

2) revenue potential
W&L and Wilson field are definitely one of the
best facilities in Division III, so I have con-
fidence that criteria No. 1 is covered.
Translated, criteria No. 2 simply means crowd
attendance — the bigger the crowd on Wednes-
day, April 29, the better W&L’s chances for a
first round home game on May 6.

So, not only is W&L competing against
Roanoke on the field next Wednesday, W&L is
also competing against Hobart, Ohio Wesleyan,
St. Lawrence, RIT, Washington College, Cort-
land State, Roanoke, Hampden-Sydney, Frank-
lin and Marshall and others in the stands.

Please be in the stands Wednesday, April 29 at
3:00.

Thank you. Dennis Daly

I am writing this letter to you out of despera-

met last night for a special meeting to try and
organize a rush calendar suitable to the faculty
and administration as well as looking out for our
best interests and the interests of next year’s
freshmen. I personally wrote up a calendar I
thought would make both sides happy, but Dean
Atkins had a rebuttal for each point we made. I
feel I’m speaking for the student leaders of
Washington and Lee that if this University
claims that we have an effective student gover-
ment, why do they not only disapprove of our
suggestions, but do not try to compromise on dif-

 

ferent issues (especially fraternal).

Each and everyone present at that meeting
last night is very concerned about the future of
Washington and Lee and as long as the Iron grip
keeps choking us, I don’t know what to do. To the
group of about 35 present last night and those
present at the IFC meeting the night before, we
know we have made a serious effort to better this
University and I would wish the members of the
Student Affairs Committee would see our con-
cern when they meet on the Rush Calendar.

Webb called ‘true gentleman’

To the Editors:

I would like to commend Michael Webb for his
letter in last week’s Phi. He deserves praise for
defending Valerie Pierson. Perhaps Rick Robins
could learn a thing or two from this true W&L
gentleman. Yes, Mr. Robins, those gentlemen
are still here in full force — you are the one in the
minority.

Rachel R. Jackson ’90

Senior responds to Robins

To the Editors:

In response to Mr. Robins’ letter last week, I
must admit that I, too, “get both furious and
sad’’ — furious that members of the so-called il-
lustrious ‘‘last class with balls” bother to revive
the issue of an all-male W&L and sad that they
fail to do so in not only an unconvincing but also
barely coherent manner.

 

The non sequitur which Mr. Robins proposes
absurdly implies that since previous W&L
graduates have been successful (pointing to the
Standard and Poor poll) and since those
graduates come from an all-male institution,
future graduates will not be as successful
because they attended school with women. One
doesn’t have to be a logician to discern that the
above rationale is ludicrous. Take a step back,
Mr. Robins. Objectively view W&L as it is, not
the way you wish to see it.

Secondly, Mr. Robins unfairly attacks Presi-
dent Wilson, describing him as ‘‘visionary.’’ I do
not think, however, that it is impractical to
bolster or even improve on a good thing. Does
Mr. Robins want stagnation and eventually
mediocrity? Furthermore, Mr. Robins describes
the Board’s decision for coeducation as “the
easy way out, instead of undertaking more ag-
gressive recruiting efforts.”’ Yet, later in his let-
ter, Robins’ argument wavers, saying, ‘‘If poten-
tial W&L gents are residing in the West or even
the North, they will find us.’’ Well, what do you
want, Mr. Robins — for the Board to recruit or to
apathetically sit back? Your elitist and arrogant
attitude hardly follows the ‘gentlemanly con-
duct”’ which you present as the underlying prin-
ciple of the W&L MAN.

Thirdly, Mr. Robins equates “uniqueness’’
with monotony and homogeneity. Judging from
his remarks, he'd like everyone here to reside
south of the Mason-Dixon line and east of the
Mississippi. Boy, wouldn’t that be a “unique”
school? Why can’t being the best small universi-
ty in the South be a satisfactory qualification for
“‘uniqueness’’?

Finally, having been here for two years of both
all-male and coed W&L, I admit there are a
number of things I miss. After all, I was one of
many who adamantly opposed coeducation two
and a half years ago. Still, coeducation has been
a huge plus for the campus. If having increasing-
ly competitive SAT scores, a diverse student
body, and competition, both socially and
academically, with women scares Mr. Robins
and his disciples, then I suggest a quaint school
not too far from here in Farmville for them to
spend the remainder of their college careers.

Perhaps Mr. Robins cannot be faulted, though.
For, within only 20 months those fiendish W&L
women have seduced and corrupted his once lof-
ty ideals and sound reasoning powers. Then
again, I doubt they’ve even tried to seduce him.

OPINION/NEWS

 

It was the second day of Spring
Term, and | felt about as exciting and
creative as a student election poster.

So once again, I found myself swig-
ging dark, foamy ones at the old milk
bar, when a voice asked me what was
wrong. I looked up to discover that
after a year and a half, Captain
Honor Code had returned.

“Well,” I said, “I’ve recently
heard students talk about past years’
honor trials, and these armchair
jurors have no clue about what
they’re saying.”

“But won’t discussion of honor
cases strengthen their understanding
of the honor system?” asked Captain
Honor Code.

“Not if they are distributing false
rumors. A lot of people still are talk-
ing about the case in which I served
as a juror last year. Some students
speculated that the accused was ‘let
off’ because there was a dispropor-
tionate number of freshmen on the
jury. That simply is not true.

“All the jurors were picked by the
computer according to the rules set
forth in the White Book. The fresh-
man jurors acted maturely and
responsibly during the deliberations.
Voting was by secret ballot, as was
required, but I know the freshmen
cast theirs thoughtfully. By not
allowing freshmen on the jury, we
would allow for expulsion without
representulsion, or something like
that.”

“So why was the guy acquitted if he
admitted to stealing a tub of wine
while intoxicated?”’

“T don’t know. I cannot speak for
all jurors, only myself.”’

“Ts that the only reason you’re
upset?’’ asked the Captain.

“No,”’ I said. “Being a juror gives
you a whole new perspective on the
honor code. As the Law News pointed
out in an editorial, there seem to be
no standards regarding admissibility

of evidence. We were allowed to sub-
mit handwritten questions after each
witness testified, but the presiding of-
ficer often decided that they were not
relevant or that they had been asked
already. I thought most of them were
important, relevant questions.

“Also, the White Book does not
allow the jury to bring a written copy
of the judge’s charge into the
deliberations room. I don’t under-
stand why.”

“So is that why he was let off?”
Captain Honor Code asked.

“Well, I don’t think that ‘let off’ is
really the appropriate phrase in this
case. In the honor trial we’ve been
discussing, the accused followed all
the proper procedures and was ac-
quitted.

“But why?” Captain Honor Code
asked again. “‘Isn’t it contradictory
to call someone honorable after he
confesses to stealing?”’

“Not to everyone, obviously. To
quote Billy Joel, I think it was just a
matter of trust. The White Book says
the honor code is based on trust. And
although the accused admitted to
stealing, not one witness said he
distrusted him. Not the cop who stop-
ped him. Not the people at Spanky’s
restaurant, which continued to ac-
cept his business.”’

“You do realize that there could be
some questions about your telling me
this, considering Section O’s provi-
sions for confidentiality,” Captain
Honor Code said.

“Yes, I know. But why let the ig-
norant pass rumors when I can tell
some truth? Why not give people the
chance to have informed discussions
about the honor code and the opinions
of the current student generation?

“T almost ended up on jury duty
again this week. It seems like an ap-
propriate time to remind people
about what constitutes an informed
opinion.”

 

 

Cancer run planned

From Staff Reports

 

Athough last week’s torrential
rains have forced some changes in
the 10-kilometer course, the plans for
tbe Rockbridge Cancer Run ’87, “‘A
Run With George Cunningham,”
have been finalized.

The 5- and 10-kilometer races and
the one-mile fun run/walk will begin
at 1:30 p.m., Sunday on Wilson Field.
The event will be held rain or shine.
All proceeds from the Cancer Run
vill othe American Cancer Socie-

Organizers of the run have chang-
ed the 10K route from the course
originally announced because high
waters on the Maury River have forc-
ed the closing of the Chessie Trail
Bridge at VMI Island.

The 5K and 10K races will begin at
1:45 p.m. in front of the law school
adjacent to Wilson Field. Both
groups will follow the first portion of
the cross country course behind the
student pavilion and the houses on
Anderson Drive. The runners will
take the lower trail along the VMI
tennis courts to the small green
house on the left.

At that point, the 5K runners will
turn left and go back along the upper
trail and the Woods Creek Trail to the
finish line. The 10K runners will turn
right, go to Main Street, and take a
left at the Stop-In. The runners will
then proceed across the traffic
bridge on the left side and take a left
at the light at East Lexington. The
runners will run about a half a mile
out, turn around and retrace their
steps across the bridge and up Main
Street.

The runners will continue on Main
into town and take a right on Letcher
Avenue, and stay on Letcher until
Moody Hall on the VMI post. They

will take a left at Moody and then
another left at the Marshall Museum.
The runners will then follow the road
down the hill and up Anderson Drive
to rejoin the trail for the finish.

The fun run/walk will begin at 1:30
p.m. at the W&L law school. The
course is a half mile down the Woods
Creek Trail and back. The course is
designed for runners and walkers of
all ages, including grandparents and
babies in strollers.

Registration for the races will
begin at noon on the grounds of the
law school. The fee for the 5K and
10K races is $5. There is no charge for
the fun run/walk. Runners can also
register on race day; the cost for
registering then is $6. All entry fees
are tax-deductible.

Wendy’s Old Fashioned Ham-
burgers and University Florist are
co-sponsoring this year’s event. Each
has donated $200 to help defray the
cost of the T-shirts. Each runner who
raises $10 or more in pledges will
receive a shirt.

Wendy’s is also providing refresh-
ments, volunteers and age-group
prizes. Jefferson Cups engraved by
Hamric & Sheridan Jewelers will go
to the winners of the race and to the
person who raises the most money.
Sweet Things of Lexington will pro-
vide ice cream for all fun run-
ners/walkers under the age of 12.

The Cancer Run honors George
Cunningham who, despite his battle
with cancer, has become one of the
area’s most prolific runners.

Entry forms and more information
about the run can be obtained by con-
tacting Patti Ryan-Mandel, race
coordinator, at 628 Stonewall St.,
Lexington, Va. 24450, (703) 463-8460.
Forms are also available at Wendy’s
in Lexington and the University
Florist in Lexington.

Possible problems seen

By STACY MORRISON
Staff Reporter

 

If sororities come to Washington
and Lee University, they will have no
extraordinary zoning problems when
they find a house in Lexington, said
Lexington City Manager Joe King.

“It all depends on the zoning
district where the house is,” he said.
If a sorority wants to obtain a house
in what is considered a “general
residential area” it must first obtain
a special permit from the city. All
fraternities, sororities, boarding
hemes, tourist homes and retirement
homes must obtain such permits,
said King. This permit is a “condi-
tional use permit.”

“The Building and Zoning Ad-
ministration has a wide discretion in
banning and granting this permit.
The decision is based on the number
of people living in the dwelling, park-

ing, location and traffic,’ said King.

Types of dwellings that do not need
a conditional use permit in residen-
tial areas are single-family homes,
two-family homes (duplexes),
schools, churches, parks and
playgrounds. King added that most
property in Lexington is zoned as
general residential area. If, however,
a sorority finds a suitable dwelling in
the central commercial and business
district of Lexington, it will be allow-
ed to house there without any special
permits.

The biggest problem for incoming
sororities, said King, will be finding a
house or dwelling that could be con-
sidered desirable for sorority life.
‘‘All the big houses that are like most
of the fraternity houses are not on the
market,”’ he said. “I can’t think of
anything large enough that would be
going up for sale.”’

Admissions: more than just grades

By JACK CHAMBERLAIN
From The Roanoke Times & World-
News

At 10:20 a.m. on Jan. 19, William
Hartog, director of admissions at
Washington and Lee University,
reads the first name from a stack of
applications that Julia Kozak and
Chris Lion had lugged into his office
on the second floor of Washington
Hall.

They vote to hold the file for
midyear senior grades.

Kozak, associate director of admis-
sions, and Lion, in his first year as an
admissions counselor, toss their
voting slips onto the file. Hartog
drops the file to the floor next to his
right foot.

It took two seconds.

Dan Murphy, associate admissions
director, and Mimi Milner Elrod,
assistant director, would review
their files with Hartog in the after-
noon. Most of the best and worst have
already been decided, so most of
these will be tough calls, mostly re-

ts.

Hartog reads another name. No,
she’s out.

“Hey, we made our first decision,”
Kozak quips.

Another no, a hold, a no. A girl gets
three no votes, another gets three
yeses,

“Yay! We’ve admitted one!”’ says

Smokeout coming to campus

By TOM BRICKEL
Staff Reporter

For those members of the W&L
community who’ve seen their
dreams of quitting tobacco products
go “up in smoke,” an upcoming
event will afford smokers and users
of smokeless tobacco products a
chance to kick the habit.

Sponsored by the university’s
Alcohol and Health Awareness Com-
mittee, the campus’ first ‘‘Smoke-
out”’ ever will be held on Monday.

The committee will set up a display
table in front of the Washington and
Lee snack bar. Among the materials
to be offered are a video display on
smokeless tobacco, free wrist snap-
pers for those who smoke, ‘‘adopt a
smoker’”’ stickers, and copies of ‘‘The
7 Day Quitters Guide’ and ‘‘Fifty

Kozak. Another girl gets unanimous
approval.

“How about that?” says Hartog.
“Two ina row.”

They are tough on the young
women, who face keener competition
among their peers than the male ap-
plicants do among the men. A girl
gets two no votes and a hold, and
she’s out.

‘‘Were she a he,”’ Hartog sighs.

One girl’s record looked great. She
was an honor student. But she had no
high school foreign language courses
that W&L requires. Hartog’s head
sagged to his desk top in dismay.

“We don’t want to penalize kids
because of their school,’’ he says.
“Are we her first choice?”

Yes, he’s told. He drops her file on
the hold pile. She could meet the re-
quirements by taking a language at
W&L, if she’s accepted.

A girl gets three yes votes, another
three no votes.

Hartog asks about a minority ap-
plicant. W&L has few black students
and he wants more. Elrod says the
applicant is black, but ‘I don’t think
he’s going to come, though.”

“She is Jewish,” Hartog says as he
scans another file. ‘Boy, would I love
to get some Jewish kids.’’ W&L’s ap-
plication doesn’t ask about religion,
but the girl had mentioned B'nai
B’rith in her essay. W&L has fewer

Most Often Asked Questions About
Smoking and Health and the
Answers.”’ Posters will be on display
throughout the campus.

According to Carol Calkins, a
member of the Alcohol and Health
Awareness Committee, the event is
part of the committee’s effort to
branch out into health-related issues
other than alcohol.

“‘Given the number of people who
smoke on campus, we felt that by
helping raise the awareness of the ef-
fects of smoking on overall health,
we would be providing an essential
service to the W&L community,”
said Calkins.

“Many former smokers report not
being able to give up the habit on the
first attempt, but trying three or four
times before finally succeeding,”
said Calkins. ‘‘We intend to support

Jews than blacks.

A girl has a B-plus average, but
she’s near the bottom of her high
school class. No, no, no. ‘Talk about
grade inflation!” Hartog says.

“Geography plus diversity,” he
says of another applicant from a
small town W&L never hears from.
He and the others also like her varied
activities. She’s accepted, but Kozak
is concerned that only 35 percent of
her high school goes to college.

Hartog votes to hold another file,
but Kozak and Lion say no. Hartog
yields. The girl is rejected. He said
he has to rely on his associates or the
system won’t work, so he seldom
overrules them.

A young woman receives the high-
est academic ratings from the team,
rare indeed.

“Only thing bad on her record is a
D in math,” Hartog says. It was one
of the few times a D was overlooked.

“‘Too many hooks and one dog,” he
says of a young man. ‘“‘Lots of hooks.
Lot of time leading, not enough time
studying,’’ he says of another.

Hooks and dogs are admissions
talk for C’s and D’s.

“This guy’s taking a siesta in his
senior year,’’ he says of another as he
glances through a transcript of easy
courses. ‘‘So long, he’s gone.”’

“This is a kid who destroyed a frat
house,’’ Hartog says as the file is re-

and encourage those who have and
haven’t tried to quit smoking to do so.
It’s a highly addictive habit, but peo-
ple have successfully quit.”

The Smokeout will not be limited to
cigarette smokers, Calkins said.
‘Many young people are resorting to
smokeless tobacco — snuff and chew-
ing tobacco — as alternatives to
cigarettes. Nationwide, it is nearly a
$1 billion a year industry.

“Unfortunately, these products are
not safe either. For these tobacco
users, the Smokeout offers an effec-
tive five-minute video, as well as in-
formation for those hooked on
cigarettes.”

In addition to the snack bar
displays,‘ the Alcohol and Health
Awareness Committee supports and
will participate in the Rockbridge
Cancer Run ’87 at 1 p.m. Sunday on

jected. ‘‘We’ve got enough like that
around here who are smart.”

A science scholar gets three en-
thusiastic yes votes. ‘‘We need some
science students, that’s for sure,”
Hartog says.

“Class underachiever,”’ Kozak
says of a boy with 1,290 on his SATs
but low grades. He is rejected.

Hartog grins as he pulls a file
across his desk that is thicker than
the others, a sure sign that the
academic record is thin. Hartog says
they usually are stuffed with glowing
letters from friends of the father who
probably don’t know the kid.

“The thicker the file, the thicker
the applicant,’’ he says.

Another young man has nearly
1,300 on his SATs and good achieve-
ment scores, but also lots of C’s, D’s
and F’s on his transcript.

“‘He’s history,’ Hartog says, drop-
ping the file next to his chair with a
plop.

“T like this kid. He’s an under-
achiever who has a reason,” he says
of another. His grades dropped when

: his mother died. Hartog drops his file

on the hold pile.

By the end of the day, Hartog and
his four assistants had reviewed
more than 400 files and made deci-
sions on 206 — 101 accepted, 105 re-

Wilson Field. Calkins will be among
those running.

“We hope smokers and _ non-
smokers alike become part of the
Smokeout, either by giving up the
habit or helping a friend quit,”’
Calkins said. ‘‘It’ll be a worthwhile
day for the smokers, and just a lot of
fun for everyone.”’

New freshman dean looks ahead to job

By MARIE DUNNE
Editorial Page Editor

Kenneth P. Ruscio, a Washington
and Lee alumnus who will replace H.
Robert Huntley as assistant dean of
students next year, says he has no
specific plans at this time to change
freshman orientation or programs
throughout the year. But he does
have several ideas he’d like the
university to examine.

Ruscio, a 1976 W&L cum laude
graduate who served as assistant
dean of students and assistant direc-
tor of admissions from 1976 to 1978,
added he’d like to become re-
acquainted with the college before
starting any new programs.

“My feeling is the changes that
have occurred are beneficial. I need
to get re-acquainted with (the univer-
sity). I need to find out what has gone
on here. There are some things that
haven’t changed, and I’m awfully
happy about that,”’ said Ruscio.

“T don’t have any specific plans. I
think it would be presumptuous of me
to try to come in and say, ‘Here’s
what we’re going to do,’ ’’ he said.

Ruscio was on campus to meet with
the deans and various members of
the faculty and student body and to
search for a home in the Lexington
area.

Ruscio will be responsible for
freshman and upperclass resident
life in the new Gaines residence hall.

Among some of the ideas Ruscio
has is ‘residential theme sections’
in the upperclass residence facility.

Residential theme sections, al-
ready implemented at many col-
leges, are sections ‘of the residence
hall where students with common in-
terests can live together and plan
functions around that common in-
terest, with possible involvement by
interested faculty, said Ruscio.

Another idea Ruscio wants to ex-
amine is ‘faculty forums”’ within the
residence halls to get faculty more
involved in the residential side of the
college.

“Those are some of the things that
other colleges are doing, and it’s
worth exploring whether it could be
done here. I think there’s some need
for something like that,”’ said Ruscio.

Ruscio said his highest priority will

W&L receives grant

 

rom Staff Reports

Washington and Lee has received a
$100,000 challenge grant from the Ar-
thur Vining Davis Foundations of
Jacksonville, Fla., to fund a new Pro-
gram for Leaders in Law and Com-
merce.

The program is designed to bring
business lawyers and _ business
leaders to the law school and the
School of Commerce, Economics,
and Politics as guest lecturers on the
real-world problems they face.

“We can better focus on business
activity and dispute avoidance by
bringing in business lawyers and
business leaders for a few days at a
time during the academic year,”
said Rick Kirgis, dean of the School
of Law, in announcing the grant. ‘“‘We
will ask the visiting lawyers and
business leaders to share with us
their experience and insights, in-
cluding their problems. In_ those
discussions, we will expect the
lawyers and business leaders to ad-
dress ethical issues as well as purely
legal or business issues.”

The new program will be ad-
ministered by Lyman P.Q. Johnson,
assistant professor of law, whose
teaching and research fall in the area
of business law, and Lawrence W.
Lamont, professor of administration,
whose specialty is marketing and
marketing strategy. Lamont also has
extensive experience working with

the legal profession and is widely us-
ed as an expert witness.

Under the new program, lawyers
and business leaders will serve as
guest lecturers in law and business
administration courses. They will
meet informally with both students
and faculty and — on some occasions
— give public lectures.

The visiting lawyers and business
leaders may also participate in
W&L’s existing program on Society
and the Professions: Studies in Ap-
plied Ethics. The Society and the
Professions program, begun in 1971,
includes undergraduate courses in
legal ethics and business ethics in ad-
dition to studies in journalism and
pre-medicine.

“Through the Program for
Leaders in Law and Commerce our
students will gain an appreciation of
how experienced business people and
lawyers seek to prevent problems,”’
Kirgis said. ‘‘That is a skill too often
slighted in the traditional focus on
solving problems once they have
arisen.”

The Arthur Vining Davis Founda-
tion provides grants to certain educa-
tional, cultural, scientific, and
religious institutions. Its founder, the
late Arthur Vining Davis, served for

man of the board of the Aluminum

counselors and resident advisors.
Ruscio met with this year’s dorm
counselors Friday afternoon.

“If I can’t work with dorm
counselors and R.A.s, I can’t do
anything else in my job, so that has to
be my highest functional priority,”
said Ruscio.

Regarding the changes that have
occurred since Ruscio was a student,
Ruscio said he was ‘‘strongly in favor
of coeducation’’ as a student and sup-
ported the move as an alumnus.

“For me, there was never a reason
not to be coeducational, and I’ve
welcomed the change wholehearted-
ly,” said Ruscio.

Ruscio, a member of Pi Kappa Phi
during his freshman and sophomore
years and Sigma Chi during his
junior and senior years, said that
fraternities serve a positive role on
campus, but that he’d like to see
some alternatives to fraternities.

degree from Yale and his law degree
from Vanderbilt University.

that fraternities should be concerned
about that. I don’t think anyone here
is suggesting that they be driven off
the campus,” said Ruscio.

Ruscio hopes the upperclass resi-
dential hall will provide one alterna-
tive to fraternities.

Ruscio is currently an assistant
professor in the department of social
science and policy studies at
Worcester Polytechnical Institute.
He holds an M.P.A. and Ph.D. from
Syracuse University.

Ruscio, who has traveled across
the country and taught and visited at
many colleges, said that in com-
parison to other schools, ‘‘Washing-
ton and Lee is still one of the finest
colleges in the country in my mind.”

“T think (seeing so many other col-
leges) has told me that Washington
and Lee can be better. There are
some things out there that other col-
leges and universities are doing that
would be nice to see if they would
work here,” said Ruscio. ‘‘I think the
mark of a good college is that it is
always trying to be better.”’

The Constitutional Convention will
debate five possible Constitutional
amendments. They include the ERA,
balanced budget, right-to-life, line
item veto and states’ rights.

Some state delegations still have
openings, and interested students
should contact the appropriate state
chairmen. Lists of chairmen are
posted in the library, the university
center and the Co-op.

Delegate registration will be Tues-
day through Thursday of next week
in the University Center from 1-4
p.m. The $5 fee covers both the con-
vention and post-convention enter-
tainment.

 

 

Math majors rank high

with a laugh.

If fewer than 290 men and 130

pects his yield to be about 45 percent.
He thinks he'll have to dip into his
wait list for 30 or 40 more freshmen
—even as late as August and early
September.

Hartog’s uncertainty — shared by
other admissions directors — is that
other schools have wait lists, too. The
dominoes are set in motion as appli-
cants on other wait lists get friendly
calls from favored schools during the
summer.

W&L applicants seem to have no
qualms about kissing $250 goodbye if
a school they prefer gives the nod
late in the game, Hartog said.

College admissions is a year-round
process, but it culminates in March
at W&L and other schools across the
country with a crush of decisions and
letters of congratulations or regret to
high school seniors.

Many selective schools have
reported increasing numbers of ap-
plications this year, despite a conti-
nuing decline in the number of high
school seniors. W&L, for instance,
had a record 3,335 applicants for a
freshman class of only 420.

One reason for the increase: high
school seniors are applying to more
colleges. The average for W&L ap-
plicants was seven or eight, Hartog
said, One young man applied to 18.

‘I’m nervous about that,’’ Hartog
said. ‘I'm very nervous about that.’’

The admissions process started
last September.

Hartog said he found 45 applica-
tions waiting for him when he return-
ed to work after Labor Day last fall.
The flood didn’t stop until after the

1,265 from women, compared to only
975 applications nine years ago.

“And you’re wondering why we
have smirks on our faces,’’ Hartog
said, a smirk on his face. He was in
admissions director’s heaven. He
could be more selective than ever
this year. He was proud of his school,
even a little smug.

“Today's applicant pool at W&L is
stronger than the enrolling class in
1984,” the last year the school was all
male, Hartog said. Most of this
year’s applicants, particularly the
women, could have made it into
almost any college or university, he
said.

On a chilly January afternoon,
stacks of files from 54 women
covered his desk on the second floor
of Washington Hall.

What Hartog was nervous about
was the ‘‘yield’’ on the acceptance
letters. How many of those high
school seniors W&L accepted for its
freshman class would actually show
up this fall instead of heading for
UVa, William and Mary, or a Har-
vard, a Princeton or a Duke?

‘You have to have a little bit of the
riverboat gambler in you to play this
game. We really don’t want to offer
admission to one more than we have
to,” Hartog had said several weeks
earlier. W&L has room for 290 men
and 130 women this fail.

‘Basically, what the president
wants is 420 kids,’ he said. ‘‘He
doesn’t want 421, he doesn’t want
419.”

tor for eight years, has done what

Hartog and Murphy have a mild

“Only another 3,000 decisions to
go,” Hartog says. ‘‘We’re rolling.”

Hartog, Murphy, Kozak, Elrod and
Lion lug their files up one floor to
Room W-32 and stack them on a con-
ference table 8 feet square. There are
19 stacks, each about a foot high.

Hartog announces that they have
made 1,379 decisions so far. They
have accepted 416 men and 180
women. They have rejected 414 men
and 369 women. Only 1,500 or 1,900 to
go, he says.

The task on March 9 was to review
the applications from 215 high
schools that had from four to 26
students apply. The idea is to be con-
sistent.

“It would be wise to keep track of
all this because when the phone
starts ringing in April you may have
to speak about them,”’ Hartog says.
They visit the schools and know most
of the counselors and principals.

“IT think we should reject them
all,’ Murphy says of a New England
prep school where eight have applied
and one has already been accepted.
“So you would have us change our
decision?’’ Hartog asks. ‘‘It’s a little
rash to go from accept to reject.”

Hartog says the school is top notch,
and the boy won’t face tougher com-
petition at W&L. The original deci-
sion stands.

“Tm tired of mediocrity from that
school,’ he says of another North-
eastern prep school. Reject all four.
Hartog describes a private school
near Atlanta as a ‘‘white flight
school’ of questionable quality. They
accept one of six applicants.

“IT think we can reject her,’’ Kozak
says of a girl from Texas. “I don’t
think we should do that,’’ Hartog
says. They hold her file.

Hartog says the basketball coach is
interested in one young man, but he
can’t go along. Scores are all right,
but his grades are poor. ‘We'll let

Three days later, Hartog says a
boy from Connecticut looks good, ex-
cept the alumnus who interviewed
him was appalled that the boy show-
ed up in Topsiders without socks
when it was 20 degrees with a food of
snow outside.

A black applicant from New
England is accepted despite SATs
under 1,000.

‘‘How are we coming on minorities
this year?”’ Lion asks. ‘‘Slow,’’ Har-
tog says. Elrod checks a computer
printout and reports they have ac-
cepted a dozen so far.

A hot football and basketball pro-
spect with top scores, grades and
class rank has applied to the entire
Ivy League and W&L is not at the top
of his list, but Hartog accepts him.

“He did everything we asked him
to do,”’ Hartog says. ‘‘I have no pro-
blem with anyone who wants to go to
Harvard.”

Hartog is torn between accepting a
girl near the top of her class with
SATs of barely 1,100 or a classmate
lower in rank with scores of nearly
1,400.

“Oh, I hate this,’”’ he says. ‘‘Why
don’t we have about 40 more slots for
women?”

He decides on the girl with the
higher class rank and lower scores.

On March 16, Hartog tells his staff
they have accepted 693 applicants so
far with average SATs of 610 verbal
and 653 math who rank in the top fifth
of their high school classes. Just 182

performed at the highest levels,”
Hartog said. The competition dic-
tates who gets accepted. Competition
seeks its own level. ‘All we're going
to do is select the best 900 from that
pool. I have no agenda.”’

Hartog and his four assistants had
spent the last three months poring
over stacks of files from 3,335 ap-
plicants at the rate of about 400 a
week, evaluating and marking their
ballots for their next meeting. They
met twice a week for two months,
hacking away at the dwindling stacks
until there were none.

“This is the easy part of the year.
This is the time we make the obvious
decisions,”’ Hartog said as he conven-
ed the first admissions meeting in his
office on Jan. 19.

‘When in doubt, hold,”’ he tells his
associates, Julia Kozak, associate
director of admissions, and Chris
Lion, a rookie admissions counselor
who graduated from W&L last year.

Dan Murphy, associate director
who has been in admissions for nine
years, and Mimi Milner Elrod, assis-
tant director in her first year, would
bring their stacks of folders to Har-
tog’s office that afternoon.

“Don't feel you have to make a
decision, particularly at this time of
the year,” Hartog told them. “We
don’t need to get into a great debate
in January and February. We don’t
need to get emotional.”’

‘‘Who gets emotional?’’ Kozak said
witha laugh.

SOSCCSOCPPOSCOSOHSOGOSSS®

Most of the time Hartog and his
assistants had taken the files home to
read .at night and on weekends
because they spend most of their
days telephoning high schools for
more information, fielding calls from
anxious parents or counselors and in-
terviewing applicants.

Hartog recalled a weekend a few
years ago when he needed some files
a colleague had at home. They ar-
ranged to meet halfway in a deserted
restaurant parking lot near In-
terstate 81. It was dark. They flashed
their headlights in recognition. They
exchanged files through car win-
dows. They sped away.

When they saw each other on Mon-
day morning, they burst into
laughter. What if someone had seen
them? It had been like a drug-buy
scene from ‘‘Miami Vice.”

SPOS HHO SSP ESHPOSSOSS

Hartog, who has been in college ad-
missions 17 years and at W&L for
nine, survived a storm of alumni pro-
test when he supported going coed
three years ago to bolster the sagging
quantity and quality of applications.
W&L, a traditional, conservative,
Southern school whose history in-
cludes’ George Washington and
Robert E. Lee, had been all-male

would reject 67.

Special letters would go to the
fathers of students who weren’t ac-
cepted before the students would get
their letters. It was a courtesy, and
better than explaining on the tele-
phone.

‘The problem with the telephone is
they’ll be emotional,”’ he said. ‘‘A let-
ter gives them time to really think
about what our situation is here.”’

A list of legacies of interest to the
president, director of development
and director of alumni relations
totals 42. Sixteen had been accepted
earlier as “clearly admissible,” so
Hartog and his staff had to carefully
reconsider 26.

They accept five, reject 13 and put
five on the wait list.

A young man gets four yes votes,
but Hartog votes no because his
record is peppered with C’s. ‘‘He will
not get the work done, but we’ll take
him,” he says. “‘As far as I’m con-
cerned, he doesn’t deserve to be
here.”

“Let’s turn him down,” Murphy
says. ‘‘No. My question is not
whether he can do the work, but
whether he will get the work done,”’
Hartog says.

Two young men whose SATs are
under 1,000 are rejected because they
can’t do the work.

“It’s all subjecture,”’ Hartog says.
‘Who the hell knows what it takes to
do the work here?”’

Someone says a female with an
average record really wants to go to
another school. ‘‘They won’t take her
so I guess that means we’ll get stuck
with her,’ Hartog says. She’s ac-
cepted.

“No, if we can get away with it,”
Kozak says of a trustee’s child who
barely cracked 400 on the SAT ver-
bals.

“Let’s try to get away with it,”
Hartog says.

The father of a boy who ranks near
the middle of his class went to W&L
only a year, but Kozak says he should
be treated as a legacy to be fair. They
decide to put him on the wait list.

“The only thing that allows us to
sleep at night is consistency — or a
very good reason for being inconsis-
tent,”’ Hartog says.

But this was the year of Hartog’s
vindication, the year numbers and
the quality of the applicants broke
records, the most since 2,639 two
years ago when W&L accepted its
first female undergraduates.

Women had applied, of course, but
so did more men than ever.

The last year W&L was all-male,
the school received about 1,500 ap-
plications and accepted 900 or 60 per-
cent of them. This year, W&L receiv-
ed more than 2,000 applications from
men and nearly 1,300 from women for
about the same size class.

Since going coed, W&L has cut its
acceptance rate in half. Hartog
believes W&L has become as selec-
tive as UVa, which started accepting
women undergraduates 20 years ago.
This year, 230 or 19 percent of W&L’s
1,200 undergradutes are women. The
goal in three years is to have 1,000
men and 500 women.

The administration and Board of
Trustees are easing into coeducation,
so Hartog had orders to hold the new
freshman class to 30 percent female.
As a result, a higher percentage of
women applicants were judged as a
group for fewer spots than the
women. This means that a woman
has to be smarter than a man to get
in.

“If we were sex blind, we’d pro-
bably be 50-50 right now,” Hartog
said.

PSFOSSOSSOSSSSOSCOCOSSOSD

Some colleges and universities use
what is called ‘‘rolling admissions’”’
where each decision is made as the
applications come in. At W&L, most
decisions were made after the
deadline so the admissions staff
could rate each file against the com-
petition and take the best.

Trustee policy also requires
special consideration for the sons and
daughters of alumni, who are called
legacies. Their status was clearly
noted on their files, which were held
for special review if they did not sur-
vive the competition of other ap-
plicants.

If their scores and grades show
they can and will do the work, they’re
in,
Hartog glanced at the file of an
alumnus’ daughter and stacked it
with the others for the legacy
meeting.

““She’s not going to make it,”’ he
said, wringing his hands in despair.
“T’ll get about 19 telephone calls.’’ He
looked at another. ‘‘Oh, no,’’ he
groaned.

This year, 192 sons and daughters
of alumni applied, and 61 were ac-
cepted on their own merits. That left
113 for special consideration. Of
those, 28 were accepted, and 23 were
put on the wait list — some of them
quite reluctantly.

It’s easier, and kinder, to tell an
alumnus’ father that his son or

daughter still has a chance at the old
school, even if a snowball has a bet-
ter chance in July

FSR SO RPE SHSEROHSESCED

Hartog and his staff also favor
residents of Lexington and Rock-
bridge County, racial minorities,
religious minorities and candidates
who live in places that will give W&L
— known as a preppy place for rich,

white, Protestant kids driving
BMW’s — more diversity.
Legacies, racial minorities and

residents of Lexington and
Rockbridge County have twice the
chance of getting in as other ap-

plicants with similar academic
records, Hartog said.
“Make note. I didn’t include

athletes,” he quickly added.

He had special lists of athletes
from the coaches, but the applicant
had to meet minimum guidelines
—such as at least 500 on each
Scholastic Aptitude Test section,
course requirements and class rank
— to even be considered.

Hartog said he imposed the
academic parameters to keep the
coaches from wasting their time pur-
suing mental midgets. Hartog
discussed athletes who met the
minimums with coaches individual-
ly.

POP SSM SCHEPOCMESSED

W&L has not cut off scores for the
SATs, The College Board’s standar-
dized tests for verbal and math abili-
ty, Hartog said. But the prevailing
scores tend to rise with the quality of
the applicant pool. Possible scores
are 200 to 800 in each category.

But he and his associates often
looked askance at scores much below
600 if the file didn’t have redeeming
academic and social value — like
high achievement scores and lots of
A’s in tough courses at a good school,
or signs of leadership or special
talent.

High scores on the SATs — say
1,300 to 1,400 or more — with C’s and
D’s in the high school record were
sure signs that a kid may be smart,
but lazy. W&L didn’t want them this
year.

W&L rejected 47 percent of the ap-
plicants with verbal SAT scores
higher than 600 and 57 percent with
math scores over 600 because of
mediocre high school records, usual-
ly average or poor grades or a weak
academic program.

At least two rejects had scores of
700 verbal and 710 math, 1,410 com-
bined.

Modest combined SAT scores in the
1,000 to 1,200 range, backed with lots
of A’s and maybe a B or two in tough
courses, showed a kid was a hard
worker. W&L took lots of them.

The average SAT scores of those
accepted this year were 603 verbal
and 646 math, seven and four points

more than last year. But they also
averaged in the 87th percentile — the
top fifth — of their senior classes.

“The public, by and large, thinks
all we look at are scores, grade point
averages and class rank. In reality,
nothing is taken at face value,”’ Har-
tog said. Good grades and class rank
mean nothing if the courses are fluff
and the school has a reputation for
giving away A’s and B’s. ‘We will
turn away people who rank in the top
10 percent of their class if we feel the
program was weak.”

On the last day of their decisions,
March 25, Hartog and his staff declin-
ed to accept two girls from different
high schools who were valedictorians
of their classes. Top grades and top
class rank meant nothing if the
schools, the academic programs and
the SAT and achievement scores
were weak compared with the rest of
the female applicants.

That was tough. They didn’t want
to take them, but they didn’t want to
discourage their schools from en-
couraging more applicants next

year. They reluctantly put them on ,

the wait list to avoid offending the
schools.

A’s in a strong program at a good
high school are the first things Har-
tog and the others look for on an ap-
plication. SAT and achievement
scores in English and two subjects
chosen by the student are important,
but the W&L admissions staff are
more impressed by high class rank in
a good school and A’s and B’s ina
strong academic program that in-
cluded college Advanced Placement
courses, honors classes, English,
laboratory sciences and _ several
years of a foreign language.

“We're looking at the academic
record,”’ Hartog said. Eighty percent
of the decisions are based on high
school transcripts, not SAT scores
alone, he said.

When in doubt, they also consider
the recommendations from high
school counselors and teachers, per-

sonal interviews at W&L or by one of ,

450 alumni representatives in 75
cities, and the applicant’s own essay.

“‘We’re not looking for the great ‘

American novel, that’s for sure,”
Hartog said. They are looking for
good writing with some thinking
behind it, not just an account of a
summer vacation.

Interviews are not required, but
highly recommended. If an accept-
able applicant hasn’t been interview-
ed on campus or in his home state by
March, the admissions staff assumes
W&L isn’t his first choice. Most like-
ly, Hartog said, that file is sidetrack-
ed in favor of ‘‘someone of com-
parable quality who really wants to
be here.”’

Lexington artists
receive grants

 

By MARY BISHOP
From The Roanoke Times & World-
News

Two artists who live and work here
— photographer Sally Munger Mann
and poet Dabney Stuart — have won
fellowships from the John Simon
Guggenheim Memorial Foundation
of New York.

They are among 273 winners of the
prestigious fellowships selected from
3,421 applicants. The fellows, in-
cluding writers, composers, chore-
ographers, painters, sculptors,
photographers, film makers and
video artists, are chosen for
distinguished past achievement and
promise of future accomplishment.

Mann, who received $25,000, will
use the money for a project she calls
“The Shadow of Sorrow: Teenage
Pregnancy.’’ She said that by
photographing young mothers, she
hopes ‘‘to arouse an active concern
for them, utilizing the medium I feel
most powerful — the evocative por-
trait.”

Her most recent work, titled
“Sweet Silent Thought: Photographs
of Twelve-Year-Old Girls,” deals
with the transformation of little girls
into young women. The photographs,
a source of local controversy, have
been on display in New York, San
Francisco and Washington.

Several years ago, other photo-
graphs were the subject of her book
“Second Sight: The Photographs of

Mann was staff photographer at
Washington and Lee University from
1972 to 1980.

The fellowship comes at a special
time for Stuart, a professor of Eng-
lish at W&L since 1965. His ninth
book, ‘Don’t Look Back,” will be
published this month by the LSU
Press in Baton Rouge.

His other books are “The Diving
Bell,” ‘‘A Particular Place,’ ‘“‘The
Other Hand,” “Friends of Yours,
Friends of Mine,’ ‘Round and
Round,” ‘‘Nabokov: The Dimensions
of Parody,” “Rockbridge Poems’’
and ‘‘Common Ground.”’

Stuart could not be reached Mon-
day but a W&L news release said that
he plans to use his fellowship to fur-
ther examine the themes in “Don’t
Look Back.” Five long poems about
his family were his focal point for the
book.

His poems have appeared in many
magazines, scholarly journals and
anthologies, including ‘“‘The New
Yorker,”’ ‘Southern Poetry Re-
view,’’ ‘‘Ploughshares,’’ ‘‘The

Massie speaks on Constitution

From Staff Reports

 

Ann Massie, adjunct professor of
law at W&L, will deliver a lecture on
the separation of church and state at
7:30 p.m. tonight in Francis
Auditorium in the Pearce Science
Center on the campus of Mary
Baldwin College in Staunton.

Massie’s lecture is part of ‘‘The
Supreme Court, the Bill of Rights,
and the Law,” a series of public
discussions celebrating the bicenten-
nial of the U.S. Constitution spon-
sored by Mary Baldwin College. All

than just test scores, Hartog said.

But that doesn’t mean scores are of
little importance.
’ The first consideration in the ad-
missions process, according to Har-
tog, is a student’s program of study
— the level of performance, the
degree of competition and the quality
of the secondary school as measured
by past graduates who have enrolled
at W&L. The next consideration is the
student’s scores on the SAT and
achievement tests.

Those factors show if the student is
in the competition, Hartog said. Non-
academic data is of little use unless a

student’s academic record places
him or her well within the competi-
tion. After a student has been judged
to be competitive, extra- and co-
curricular activities are considered,
as well as recommendations and in-
terviews.

Hartog said the process shown in
the article is similar to that used at
other selective schools. Interviews,
although highly recommended, do
not weigh heavily when the decisions
are being made.

“The interview is more of an infor-
mation session,’ Hartog said. “‘It’s
just a 30- or 40-minute visit.”’

Hartog said that although coeduca-
tion has helped make the school more
selective, it has not changed the ad-
missions process or the relative im-
portance of the factors considered
when accepting or rejecting stu-
dents.

Those have remained the same for
years, he said.

The Washington and Lee baseball
‘team, like many other W&L students,
spent much of their spring break
travelling. The team, however, did
not have the luxury of the sunny
beach or the snowy slope that most
students chose. Instead, the main
focus of the team’s week was double-
headers,

On Saturday, April 11, the Generals
hosted Radford, a Divison III team,
in W&L’s first doubleheader of the
break. The Generals split the after-
noon, to a team head coach Jeff

of No. 1 Matthews and McLeod, No. 2
Haley and senior Roby Mize, and No.
3 Morris and Wiman then mopped up
as they won all their matches.

The Swarthmore match was also
sewn up in the singles matches. The
two most thrilling matches were
Wiman’s and Mize’s which each went
the distance of three sets. Wiman
was particularly impressive as he
dropped the first set and was down
5-1 in the second set before making a
remarkable comeback. Mize had to
fight off numerous match points

before winning the match in a third- *

set tiebreaker.

Matthews, McLeod and Haley were
the other singles players to record
wins. The Generals then finished off
the Little Quakers by sweeping the
doubles.

“It was a great team effort,’’ said
head coach Gary Franke. ‘‘Everyone
gave their best effort and the results
are very rewarding.”

Another great effort was going to
be needed over spring break as the
team embarked on a grueling five-
match swing through Florida against
some stiff competition. The Gen-
erals, however, were up to the
challenge.

The Generals defeated St. Leo and
Stetson each by the score of 9-0. A 5-4
win over North Florida assured the
trip would be a successful one, even
though the squad lost though match-
es to Rollins (4-5) and Flagler (4-5).

“We had a great performance out

singles and doubles matches, and our

Tuesday night brought the first of
several long rainstorms and the
Thursday game against Bridgewater
on Smith Field was postponed until 3
p.m. this afternoon.

Last Saturday the Generals trav-
elled to Maryville to play two ODAC
games. The Generals knocked in

RBI’s, brought the winning runs

single. Junior Carter Steuart went all
nine for the win, evening his record
at 4-4.

The second game went into extra
innings when Talley [three hits,
three RBI's in the second game] hit a
double that scored a run. The
Maryville Scots scored twice in the
extra innings to win the game, 8-7.

Stickley said that his pitchers, so
important in tight games, are
“holding up well, battling hard’ to
keep the Generals close.

+ The undefeated Washington and

track team is preparing for the
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
thampionship meet, which will be
held at Bridgewater College Satur-
day. The Generals competed in the
Catholic University Invitational last
weekend, the first meet for the full
squad since March 24 and W&L’s
final meet before the conference
championship.

The Catholic Invitational ‘wasn’t
‘one of our better meets, and yet it
svasn’t a bad meet,” said head coach
Norris Aldridge. Junior Joseph
Fisher set a new personal record in
he pole vault by clearing 13’6”’, a full
foot higher than his previous best.
‘Freshman Wes Boyd also set a new
PR, finishing the 200-meter run in
22.6 seconds. Junior Andy White
reached the finals in the 110-meter

high hurdles with a time of 15.1
seconds. In the weight events, senior
Thomas Murray took third place in
the shot put, and sophomore James
Ambrosini placed fourth in the
discus.

Looking ahead to this weekend,
Aldridge is concerned about the
sprinters and long jumpers from
Bridgewater and the distance run-
ners and hurdlers from Roanoke Col-
lege. Nevertheless, “if we go down
with a good mental attitude and get
good performances, then we'll have a
chance to win [the conference title],”’
said Aldridge.

W&L should have the number one
position in at least four events.
Aldridge expects Murray to be seed-
ed first in the shot put. Boyd will pro-
bably be in the top position in both the
100- and 200-meter runs, and White
should be the top seed in the 110-
meter hurdles. Also, Fisher will pro-
bably be tied for the number one spot
in the pole vault, and the W&L 400-

USILA ranks lax first

Sports Editor

 

 

The United States Intercollegiate
Lacrosse Association has smiled on
* Lexington.
, The USILA, responsible for rank-
ng the nation’s collegiate lacrosse
teams, put the Washington and Lee
. lacrosse squad atop the latest Divi-
sion III poll. The Generals were rank-
’ ed seventh in the preseason poll and
, then second in the initial regular
season poll.

But, in order to keep their ranking,
, the Generals are going to have to

keep on winning — and the news from
’ Farmville was good in that respect.
, W&L traveled to Hampden-Sydney

this past Saturday and used an ex-
* ceptionally good third quarter to sub-
, due the Tigers by a score of 16-6. The
Generals’ 10th consecutive win put
their record at 10-1.

W&L held a slim 7-5 lead going into
the third period but lit the scoreboard
* with six unanswered goals to seal the
, victory.

For the year, the Generals have
* outscored their opponents 47-14 in the
, third quarter.

‘T don’t know what it is,” said W&L
head coach Dennis Daly of the third-
, quarter scoring. “I was shocked

when I first saw the numbers.

’ “Maybe we get stronger as we go

along,” said Daly. ‘Whatever it is, I

hope it keeps up.’’

Junior Pete Smith was the leading
scorer for the Generals in the
Hampden-Sydney game with four
goals.

Junior Sandy Harrison continued
to win the faceoffs; he won 19 of 24
(79.2% ) on Saturday. His season total
is an outstanding 186 of 269, or 69.1%.

Looking ahead to this weekend, the
Generals will be on the road again,
this time at Chestertown, Md., to face
Washington College.

The Sho’men have a 7-6 record and
are ranked seventh in the nation.
W&L has lost two consecutive years
to Washington College, both times by
a single goal. The Sho’men won 14-13
in overtime at Chestertown two years
ago and 11-10 in Lexington last year.

‘Washington College is a very good
team with a balanced lineup,” said
Daly. ‘“‘They have some losses, but
most of them came at the hands of
top-ranked Division I teams.”’

The Generals’ next home game,
their last of the regular season, will
be Wednesday against the Roanoke
Maroons. The Maroons have never
lost an Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference title, or even an ODAC game.
Wednesday’s game will be the first
ODAC contest between the two
teams.

The Maroons are currently ranked
eighth in the D-III lacrosse poll and,
since only the first eight teams go to
the playoffs, they will be looking to
knock off the Generals.

meter relay team is expected to
share the top seed in that event with
Bridgewater.

“The winners are important, but

what’s really going to be important is
second through sixth,’’ says
Aldridge. The points for the non-
medal places made all the difference
in the indoor championship meet,
and a victory this Saturday will re-
quire just as much depth, according
to Aldridge.
MILEPOSTS — Some individual
results from the Division II & Ill
state meet, held in Hampton on April
11: junior Richard Moore placed se-
cond in the 1500-meter run (4.04, a
personal best), sophomore Jamie Ur-
so took third place in the 800-meter
run (1:57), and Murray was third in
the shot put (48°6’’).... W&L will con-
tinue competition even after the
ODAC season is over. The Generals
are scheduled to compete in invita-
tional meets at James Madison cn
May 2 and UVa. on May 9.

Sophomore Robert Haley puts some topsin on the ball.

W&L went with a juggled lineup and
the matches provided the opportuni-
ty for some of the other players on
the team to play. Freshmen Matt Or-
miston and Billy Tunner came away
with singles and doubles victories in
yesterday’s match versus Averett.

support from the rest of the team.
After winning the first game, the
Generals stranded 14 baserunners in
the nightcap, wasting Steuart’s out-
standing two hit effort.

The Generals now stand at 6-12
overall, 4-8 in the ODAC. Stickley
said that “we are playing better,
good enough to have a shot’ at
finishing in the top five in next week’s
ODAC tournament.

The team has two more games [at
Eastern Mennonite on April 22, and
Christopher Newport at home at 3
p.m. on April 24] in which to fine tune
for the tournament.

“The last few games are the most
important tous,” said Stickley.

As the Washington and Lee
women’s tennis team prepares for
the upcominig Old Dominion Athletic
Conference Championships it ap-
pears to be in very good shape. The
team has won it’s last three matches
and the team members are confident
going inot the tournament.

Yesterday, the Lady Generals
traveled to Mary Baldwin and came
back with a 6-3 win to put their season
record at 5-3.

Yesterday’s match was even after
the singles matches with Bitsy Hop-
per, Valerie Pierson, and Benny
Savage all winning for the Lady
Generals.

W&L, however swept the singles
matches to take the victory.

The Lady Generals also won on
Tuesday at Sweet Briar by a 5-4
score.

Winning singles matches for the
Lady Generals in their match against
Sweet Briar were Hopper, Teresa
Southard, and Katherine Nelligan.
Battling out of the singles matches
with an even score, W&L’s doubles

2nd season is a winning one

teams proved to be too much for their
opponents. The team of Hopper and
Dana Anstine as well as the team of
Southard and Eggers won to seal the
victory.

Over the past couple of weeks the
team has hit rough waters. The team
lost a couple of 5-4 decisions to
Randolph-Macon Woman's College
and Bridgewater, and also lost 9-0 to
Emory and Henry, the team they will
probably have to face in the upcom-
ing Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference Championship. The Lady
Generals then bounced back to sur-
pass Roanoke 9-0 and defeated Sweet
Briar.

The ODAC championships will be
held this weekend at Sweet Briar.
Head coach Bill Washburn is very
hopeful. ‘‘I am very much encourag-
ed,” said Washburn. “I think it is
possible for us to make a good show-
ing.”

Last year was a disappointment for
the team, but it was only the team’s
first year of existence.

“Last year we had no idea how
they even ran it,” said Hopper in
reference to the tournament. With a
better understanding of the tourna-
ment, the Lady Generals should be
able to make a better showing.

Golf has problem with layoff

By MIKE SHADY
Assistant Sports Editor

To emulate ESPN’s Chris Berman,
way back back back back back back
back on March 24, the Washington
and Lee golf team came in first place
in one of those Old Dominion Athletic
Conference round-robin tourna-
ments. If that seems like ages ago,
you are correct. March 24 was 11
days before exams even started.

At the Countryside Club in
Roanoke on Monday, after 27 days of
non-competitive golf, the Generals
dusted off their clubs and slugged
their way to a third-place tie in the
final ODAC tournament of the season
before the ODAC championships.
W&L tied Randolph-Macon at 336
while the home team Roanoke
prevailed with a 322. Bridgewater
grabbed second place by carding a
329.

“Tt was our first competition in 27
days,”’ said head coach Buck Leslie.
“We were just hoping to get out
alive.”’

 

Junior John Gammage led the
Generals with a 79, followed by
sophomore Pete Coleman and senior
Mark Zavatsky, who each scored an
83. Junior Chip Gist, usually the low
scorer for W&L, managed a some-
what disappointing 88.

“Chip just had a bad round,” said
Leslie. He can come back.”’

Leslie explained that the long
layoff between matches was not due
to a scheduling error, but because of
a conflict with W&L’s exam period
and spring break.

“During exams, we miss two tour-
naments and this year Georgetown
{the Georgetown Invitational] was
cancelled. There wasn’t anything we
could get into.

“We like to pick up [a match] at
the end of break but this time there
was no place for us to go,”’ he said.

The Generals will now prepare for
the ODAC championships, which will
be held on the same course in
Roanoke on April 27-28. W&L made a
trip to Roanoke yesterday in order to
play a practice round.

track hopes to garner ODAC ‘s

By JIM LAKE

The W&L track team will almost
certainly be without one of its top
performers in this weekend’s Old
Dominion Athletic Conference cham-
pionship meet. Senior John Burlin-
game, the 1987 ODAC indoor long
jump champion and one of W&L’s
best runners, pulled a hamstring at
the Catholic University Invitational
last Saturday.

Burlingame strained his hamstring
in the middle of March, and W&L
head coach Norris Aldridge had held
him out of competition since then.
But last week Aldridge decided to
enter Burlingame in the 400-meter
relay in the Catholic Invitational.

“It wasn't really a bad pull,” said

 

Aldridge. ‘‘We thought he was ready
[to come back], and we wanted to
test it before ODAC’s.’’ When Bur-
lingame took the baton in the final leg
of the 400 relay, the Generals ap-
peared to be on their way to a school
record. Instead, he pulled up about 50
yards short of the finish line.

However, Burlingame, a member
of Phi Kappa Sigma, did play intra-
mural basketball for his fraternity. _

Burlingame originally denied hav-
ing played in Wednesday night’s IM
game against Sigma Alpha Epsilon,
but later admitted that he had
played.

“Yeah, I did play basketball,”
Burlingame said, ‘‘but sprinting is an
entirely different ball game. You
have to go 100 percent all the time.”

Burlingame said that he had

Burlingame injured; is doubtful for meet

bicycled 10 miles Wednesday and had
been seeing the trainer twice daily.
He said he did not play an IM game
Tuesday night, but Wednesday night
he felt that he could play at half
speed.

Senior Jefferson Harralson, who
officiated Wednesday’s game, said
that Burlingame’s performance was
affected.

“He made it known he was hurt,
and pulled up short a couple of
times,” said Harralson.

Burlingame said that Wednesday
night’s game ‘‘was very, very impor-
tant tome” and to his fraternity.

Looking ahead to this weekend’s
conference championship meet,
Burlingame said that he may still be
able to compete in the long jump, but
the decision would not be made until
later in the week.

 

 

 

 

 

JOHN MORRIS

ALERTS RCTS ALE; A SRT EE

By JOHN PACKETT
Staff Reporter

 

Freshman tennis player John
Morris from Memphis, Tenn., has
been selected as Washington and
Lee’s Athlete of the Week.

Morris, the General’s number
six seed, was undefeated in
singles in the team’s last five
matches. Morris also teamed up
with Chris Wiman at the number
three doubles spot to go 4-0 over
the last week.

‘‘A big help for me was beating
a guy on the Rollins team who I
practice with some in the sum-
mer. He usually beats me when-
ever we play, so it was a big win,”’
said Morris.

Morris defeated his Rollins op-
ponent 2-6, 6-2 and 6-2.

In last Thursday’s match
against Flagler he had an easy
time defeating his opponent 6-3
and 6-1. Then on Friday he had to
go to a third set to defeat his

[ W&L Athlete of the Week’

University of Northern Florida
opponent 6-7, 6-2 and 6-2.

“The singles win in the Rollins
match set the tone for the rest of
the week and gave me momen-
tum,” said Morris.

In Tuesday’s match against
Christopher Newport College
Morris found himself playing at
the number three spot because of
injury. He still won easily.

In yesterday’s match against
Averett he won playing at the
number four position.

The Generals are playing in the
ODAC tournament this weekend
and the Nationals are coming up
soon, so the team will be practic-
ing a lot harder and longer.

Morris said he doesn’t mind the
practice because tennis is very
fun for him and he said that he
would be lost without it this
spring.

Morris started playing tennis
when he was eight and then
Started into tournament play
when he was 10.

Striving for Success

It’s right there, printed on the
Heinsohn and Day schedule.

February 16 — ‘‘The Tonight Show
with Johnny Carson.”’

Several W&L students believed it,
including one of the music directors
of WLUR.

Was the acoustic guitar duo of
W&L graduates Eric Heinsohn '83
and Roger Day ’85 really going to be
on national television?

No, not really.

But the schedule was right about
the duo playing for the Georgia Con-
gressional delegation in Washington,
De,

And they weren’t joking about
playing at bars in Atlanta, Birm-
ingham, Mobile, and Lexington, and
at colleges in at least four states.

They’re not kidding now, when
they say they’re giving a recital in
Lee Chapel at 8 p.m. Monday.

A recital? By a bar band? Inside
“The Shrine of the South’’?

That’s right.

It’s an opportunity to hear, without
electric amplification, the original
compositions of Heinsohn and Day.

Day said he hopes that since the
recital will be unamplified, people
will sit down and listen to the music.

‘‘When we do at a fraternity party
what's unique to Heinsohn and Day,
it’s almost impossible for anything to
come through just because of the
framework that we're operating in,”’
Day said.

“Put us in a different framework,
put us in a hall with 300 or 400 people
who are expecting to hear original
music — who would be disappointed
if you don’t play it — and I think we
would be very pleasing to them,” he
said.

Heinsohn and Day have had the
chance to play for audiences expec-
ting original music when they open
for bands in Atlanta, Day said.

“*We walk in and we do nothing but
Heinsohn and Day stuff, and they
love it,” he said. “It’s weird for Eric
and me to do it because we don’t have
people screaming for Jimmy Buffett
or ‘Brown-eyed Girl.’ ”’

But Heinsohn said the recital does
not signal an end to what area fans
have come to expect from Heinsohn
and Day.

Usually, a Heinsohn and Day con-
cert consists primarily of music by

G-men
carry
Weapon

By MICHAEL TUGGLE
Staff Reporter

 

In the beginning he _ lived
dangerously, then he became mad,
and now he is a killing machine.
Whatever the case may be, there is
no question; Mel Gibson is definitely
making his mark in the world of
Hollywood tough guys.

His new film Lethal Weapon, a
blend of To Live and Die in L.A.,
Sharkey’s Machine, and Running
Scared again allows Gibson to ex-
ecute the crazed warrior character
that he has developed so well over the
course of his previous films. Much of
his success in this film, however,
comes from playing off co-star Dan-
ny Glover.

As always, Danny Glover’s perfor-
mance is excellent. Known primarily
for his roles as an oppressed black in
Places in the Heart, The Color Purple,
and Mandela, Glover moves into his
role as commanding officer with the
grace and style that is synonymous
with him. Together, he and Gibson
make Lethal Weapon a classic good
guys, bad guys adventure.

The film opens with a beautiful girl
mysteriously diving to her death
from the window of her penthouse
balcony. Through Glover’s careful
investigation and Gibson’s neurotic
shoot-to-kill back-up, the pair
discovers that there is more to the
case than a simple suicide, and find
themselves caught up in the nar-
cotics underground.

While this premise may seem old
hand, it is not. Glover and Gibson’s
intensity and humor make this film
incredibly enjoyable. Danny Glover
is an extreme pleasure to watch and
is faultless as the commanding of-
ficer. Mel Gibson however, steals the
show as the psycho cop, maintaining
the perfect amount of intensity in
stringing along the audience’s
conclusions concerning his mental
state. In addition, Gary Bussey puts
in a quality performance as Mr.
Joshua.

If you enjoyed To Live and Die in
L.A. Or Sharkey’s Machine , then don’t
miss Lethal Weapon. It’s a great cop
movie and a really enjoyable two
hours.

other songwriters, with several
originals included.

An audience can expect to hear
anything from Bruce Springsteen to
the Grateful Dead, with standards in-
cluding Jimmy Buffett, Simon and
Garfunkel, the Beatles, Crosby, Stills
and Nash, Mike Cross and Dire
Straits.

Heinsohn and Day have even
managed to perform a medley of
television theme songs.

They will still perform shows of
that format, but the recital in Lee
Chapel will allow them to present a
program of their own work.

“Tt’s not like this is a break, that
this is the end of what you know about
Heinsohn and Day and the start of
something new about Heinsohn and
Day,’ Heinsohn said. “It’s transi-
tional to some extent.”

The two musicians have wanted to
play their own songs since they
began seriously pursuing a career in
music in late summer of 1985.

“We had envisioned all along that
we would probably move to a bigger
market,’’ Heinsohn said, ‘‘so that we
could talk to record companies, play
more original music, play more
nights of the week without overexpos-
ing ourselves.”

Day said they also wanted to move
away from Lexington ‘‘so that we
wouldn't get labeled as just Roger
and Eric hanging around.”’

He said the furthest thing from his
mind was reliving his college ex-
perience by playing at parties and
bars.

“The big irony of Heinsohn and
Day is that we didn’t party that much
while we were in college,”’ Day said.
He said he would not have been the
type of student who would spend time
in bars listening to bands like Hein-
sohn and Day. “My studies were
much more important than that,”
Day said.

That scholarly background some-
times hinders the duo in their deal-
ings with bar managers and other
possible employers.

Day said, ‘‘The guys who would
like being in bars anyway but who
also play music have an ‘in’ with the
crowd that we don’t have, and have
an ‘in’ with the management that we
don’t have because they’re sort of
partying with everyone else.

“There’s something to say for that
leading to connections that we don’t
have.”

Heinsohn and Day playing earlier this year.

But they have to make a living
somehow. As Day put it, ‘‘We’re not
in a position yet to just say, ‘This is
what we do. This is Heinsohn and
Day and if you don’t like it then you
don’t have to come hear us.’ We still
have to appeal to a larger audience,
so that the rent gets paid.”

Both musicians admit that having
the financial and marketing backing
of the national commercial music in-
dustry would be beneficial, but they
are more concerned with their art.

“The primary goal is being free to
record and perform our own music
and be able to make a living at it,”’
Heinsohn said.

Day added that their aim is to have
national recognition but not neces-
sarily national commercial success.

He named several musicians
—such as Mike Cross and Tony Rice
—as examples of the type of success
Heinsohn and Day are looking for.

“These are people that make a

very good living playing music and
play pretty esoteric music, in a way,
meaning that it’s only going to appeal
to certain people who have a certain
musical background,” Day said.

“They will never have mass ap-
peal,’’ he said. ‘‘They have a national
appeal, but it is not commercial in
the sense that Steve Perry or even
Paul Simon is commercial.”’

“As far as I’m concerned, if I’m
never Steve Perry, then I’m much
the better for it,’’ Day said.

Heinsohn said, “If there’s
something unique about Heinsohn
and Day that turns out to be commer-
cial, that may just happen, but I’m
not banking on it.”

“Tf commercial

comes along,

we're not going to turn it down,’’ Day
said.

But, Heinsohn added, ‘‘We can’t
starve, either.”

In this case, maybe they’ll end up
on “The Tonight Show”’ after all.
