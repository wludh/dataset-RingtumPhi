W&L trustees repeal coeducatio

' Wilson resigns after
. trustees historic decision

 

By MICHAEL HUNT
Staff Reporter

 

John D. Wilson is out!
= The former Rhodes Scholar, who
, has been president of Washington
and Lee since 1983, announced his
* resignation Monday. He cited the
, board of trustees’ decision to admit
only women to the University’s
* undergraduate program as_ his
» primary reason for quitting.
‘The board’s decision is really the
" best thing for the University. After
; all, there must be close to a million
small, private coeducational schools
* in Virginia and North Carolina,”
« Wilson said.

Wilson will always be remembered
as the man who brought women to
« W&L in 1985.

‘Now that the transition to an all-
female W&L has been made, I feel
+ my mission is completed,’ said a
tearful Wilson.

Wilson has been asked to head the
* notions department of Best Products
Inc., headquartered in Richmond.
But he is reluctant to accept the of-
» fer.

“T just don’t think accepting the
position is the ‘best’ thing for me or
’ the company.”
, _ Instead, Wilson said he is consider-

ing chairing a commission looking in-
‘ to the legality of merging W&L with
+ Best Products. The possible merger
was discussed by Frances Lewis,
member of the University’s board of

“The two organizations have been

“Washington and Lee will be
known as ‘The Best University in

A statement released by the board
said an extensive search to fill the
vacancy created by Wilson’s resigna-
tion is underway. As we go to press,

Colorado Congresswoman Pat
Schroeder, former university
secretary Carole Chappell and

graduating senior Andrew Caruthers
are the strongest candidates to suc-
ceed Wilson.

Sources close to the board said that
one of these three candidates will be
the next president.

After preliminary interviews are
conducted, both candidates will be
judged in swimsuit and evening wear
competitions, as well as on poise and
personality. In the case of a tie, each
candidate will be asked how they
would bring about world peace.

Rick Robbins, advisor of the
newly-formed Men’s’ Forum;
Markham Pyle, owner of the Lex-
ington Diet Center and former Ex-
ecutive Committee President John
Lewis are on the panel of judges.

The competition will be held in the

Schroer’s tarts win big

By MUFFIN BURGER
Staff Reporter

 

Associate Dean of Students Anne
C.P. Schroer is leaving Washington
and Lee University.

Schroer said in a news conference
Monday that after spending two
years at W&L she realizes a woman's
proper place is in the kitchen. ‘‘But I
wanted to combine my desire for a
career with my womanly instincts,”
she said. ‘‘So I am going to work for
Betty Crocker.”

When Schroer joins Betty Crocker
in July she will be senior vice presi-
dent for baked goods. She gained her
position with Betty Crocker by win-
ning an international bake-off,
defeating Margaret Thatcher, Jerry
Darrell and a relatively unknown
French chef, Keeble Mercier. Her
prize-winning entry was a batch of
raspberry tarts.

“It also helps when you are the
spitting image of Betty Crocker,’’ she
said in her most self-depracating
manner.

Schroer’s likeness to the world-
famous cook was also noticed by of-
ficials at Betty Crocker. Negotiations

All female classes
to begin next year

 

By LUCE NUTZ
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee Universi-
ty Board of Trustees decided in a
secret meeting Monday that a
gender-neutral student body is not
compatable with the philosophy of
the university.

However, when the wheel of fate
was spun, the coeds of the female
gender were chosen to be the ones to
walk the hallowed halls of Washing-
ton and Lee.

“‘Now we'll really be able to offer
something to prospective students:
an all-women’s college in the Valley
where one can get an education,”’
said Jefferson Davis Futch III, pro-
fessor of history.

“It’s the next best thing to an all-
male W&L,”’ said J. Thomas
Touchton ‘60, a member of the board
of trustees. ‘‘We (the board) thought
the girls would do a better job of
keeping the university clean. If they
do a good job we can lay-off some of
the maintenance crew and save some
money. It was all a question of
finance.”

Dan Rather and the crew at CBS
Evening News broke the news to the
world. There were mixed reactions
on campus.

“T think this is the greatest thing
since the beginning of point cards in
the Co-op,” gushed one sophomore
woman. ‘‘When we get rid of the text-
book section, W&L will have one of

the best cookbook selections in the
known world. After all, that is what
we are here for.”’

Another commented that Fancy
Dress would be a “‘lot better now’
because women would be in charge of
decorating.

Andrew Caruthers, a senior from
Shreveport, La. who is one of the
most outspoken opponent os coeduca-
tion, said the move was a good one.

“T liked W&L much more when it
was all-male,’’ Caruthers said. ‘‘But
since the admissions office hasn’t let
in any real men in the last two years,
I guess it was good that they made it
official.

A statement released by the
trustees said males currently enroll-
ed in the University could graduate
but no more would be allowed to
matriculate.

A second statement said no money
would be accepted from ‘‘the grubby
hands of pre-coed alumni.”’

Farris P. Hotchkiss, head of the
Development Office, is not sure how
the problem of fund raising would be
handled. He added that he did not
care because he had been fired.

Anne S. Farrar, the assistant head
of development Office, was named to
replace Hotchkiss.

“For years I have felt like Della
Street following behind Perry Mason
and doing all his dirty work,” Farrar
said. ‘‘Now I’m calling the shots.”

Farrar has quite a job ahead of
her. She must be able to raise as

EC members nailed
on honor violation

 

By ALFRED E. NEUMAN
Staff Reporter

 

All 13 members of the Executive
Committee, from President Shayam
Menon to freshman representative
Scott Jules, were found guilty yester-
day of embezzling student body funds
in an open honor trial at Lee Chapel.

What made this trial especially in-
teresting for the packed house was
that Jimmy Humphreys, the EC
representative from the third-year
law class, prosecuted himself and the
12 other committee members

The jury for the case was made up
of Lexington citizens, since no
students could be found who were not
friends or close acquaintances of the
EC members. Menon said this was
because EC candidates campaign so
extensively, EC members are widely
known and ‘‘a lot of people hold
grudges against the candidates for
leaving a ton of paper under their
doors.”’

Menon added that several people
said they would not be biased for or
against the people on trial but that he
could tell they were lying and so
dismissed them from jury duty.

Humphreys accused the EC
members of running Virginia's

largest false identification operation,
using embezzled student funds to
operate the business.

The operation was discovered
several weeks ago, Humphreys said,
when a freshman entering the GHQ
presented an I.D. that showed him to
be of legal age. When questioned how
he could be of legal age as a
freshman, the young man _ broke
down and said he got the card from
sophomore representative Christo-
pher deMovellan.

In exchange for immunity, Hum-
phreys said, the freshman brought
several of his friends to an EC
meeting one night and each identified
a different EC member who had sup-
plied him a false I.D.

Menon then assigned deMovellan,
Vice President Brandt Surgner and
first-year law representative Dave
Nave to investigate the charges.
What they uncovered will surely be
recorded in the annals of criminal
history.

The three investigators discovered
that the EC bought more than $13,000
worth of equipment to operate a false
I.D. business. Among the items
recovered by University Proctor
Murph Murray were a professional
Polaroid camera, a_ laminating

MY SPEW

By Chris Carter

 

Thank the Good Lord! I have been
waiting lo these many months and
finally it appeared. Richard Rob-
bins’s letter in last week’s Phi
demonstrated that the W&L Man
does still exist, though high on the en-
dangered species list, and should
have set us all straight on the over-
riding issue of concern for this
millenium in his clear, cogent, and
objective account of coeducation at
Washington and Lee. For those of you
who missed Mr. Robins’s epistolary
masterpiece, I shall review his well-
taken points.

There can be no question that, as
Mr. Robins says, W&L took the “‘easy
way out’ when it determined to
spend millions of dollars and enor-
mous amounts of administrative
hours to facilitate the transition to
coeducation, knowing that in so doing
it would disenchant large numbers of
alumni and students. It is just this
sort of laziness and lack of interest in
the University which infuriates me
most about the administration. And
certainly the Catharsis evoked by the
“tragedy” of coeducation has been
felt by all and hardly needed Mr.
Robins’s articulation.

Again, Mr. Robins is dead on when

he says that the W&L man of the past
could be spotted MILES away by the
code of gentlemanly conduct which
he always wore (wool before Easter,
cotton — no polyester on a W&L man
lest he take the hives Thence until
Halloween). An EC member was just
telling me the other day that since
coeducation, the sales in honor
cloaks had absolutely PLUM-
METED, and that at large cocktail
parties he no longer could distinguish
his friends from the Wahoos from
over Afton Mountain. Indeed, as Mr.
Robins so cogently points out, the
very high number of W&L grads who
are business leaders, still easily
distinguished from business leaders
who had the misfortune to graduate
from other, less success-instilling
schools, results solely from the in-
sular effects of single-sex education.
Mr. Robins continues by bemoan-
ing — and rightly so I think — the fact
that W&L persons are no longer well-
rounded. Post-Coed students tend to
have higher SAT scores, which we all
know BY DEFINITION means that
they do nothing but study. I, like him,
regret that we no longer have
students interested in sports or the
arts. Certainly the way things are go-
ing now, the Warner Center and du-
Pont Hall will soon have to be con-
verted into storage buildings for lack
of use. This is also likely to be the last
year of a Fancy Dress, since, as this
year’s ball proved without a doubt,

MY SPURT

By CLEMENT

EDWARD KLANK, III

Robert Benchley once remarked
“A man seldom thinks of taking
Turkish baths until it is too late.’’ I
would like to share with the readers a
blatant act of crudity that I ex-
perienced recently in the Co-op.

Just the other day I was in the Food
Cooperative/Bookstore and the
recently established tape and com-
pact disc shop. I was innocently
waiting in line to purchase a diet
beverage. The somewhat overweight
patron immediately in front of me
was examining the fruit and salad
bar. I immediately noticed the close
similarity between the person in
front of me and the vile Jabba the
Hut, a disgusting character from the
“Star Wars’”’ trilogy.

With a little spittle dripping from
her double chin, she eyeballed the
delicious red apples. Finally she
publicly proclaimed that she would
eat an apple — “‘I think I’ll have an
apple today.’ She aggressively lifted
an apple.

From a short distance it looked like
a respectable piece of fruit. Instead
of putting the apple on her tray, she

student interest in such social events
has become almost non-existent. But
perhaps we could convert duPont and
the Warner into clinics where the
many students who are studying and
thinking too hard to have time to eat
could attach themselves to an I.V. in
order to keep reading. Fraternity
houses too could serve this function.
Finally, in his most penetrating,
even breathtaking, point of logic, Mr.
Robins proves through the seductive
reasoning of his hero Epicureastotle
that Robert E. Lee would be
disgusted with future graduates of
his University. Certainly, it is unlike-
ly that the man who ensured that his
own daughters were well-educated
and who said that the one regret he
had about his military career was his
lack of a liberal education, who
guaranteed that the nearly defunct
Washington College should become
an educational leader by recruiting
students from outside the failed Con-
federacy, would want the successor
to that institution to press on into the
educational future and to admit
students who enjoy and are capable
of high intellectual stimulation.
Moreover, there is no question that
the man who detested drunkenness
and was a devout Episcopalian would
be a strong supporter of the current
fraternity system and social life here
at W&L. The spirit of Robert E. Lee
pervades this place, and, as Mr.
Robins so correctly points out, we
ought always to consider our own opi-

fondled it like a grease monkey
fondles his sandwich before consum-
ing it. She even had the audacity to
stick it up to her snout. Unsatisfied,
she put the apple back and picked up
another. She went through the same

ing the fruit with her scuzzy han’ ‘
and then putting it back. Finally, i

line moved forward. ;
Well, obviously this person also
had the civility of the vile Jabba the
Hut. I don’t know anyone that wants
to eat an apple that has been exten-
sively fondled by some thing. This
type of ‘‘dining foreplay”’ is simply a
lack of common courtesy and man-
ners; massaging food and then put-

ting it back for another person tocon- .

sume is barbarism. Where had her

hands been? She had probably been «

petting a canine, picking her face, or
using the restroom. This person acts

as if she were raised in a barn; she °

would probably fit in with a bunch of

swine. If you touch it, eat it. I honest-

ly felt like sticking the apple in her
fat jowls, but I was afraid she would
swallow it whole with my arm right
behind the apple. If you see a person

massaging food and then putting it _

back for another person to eat, beat
the thing like a stepchild. In conclu-
sion, ‘Friends come and go, but
enemies accumulate.”’

nions of what he would have thought
about any issue, regardless of our
amount of knowledge of the issue or
of Lee himself.

The members of the student body

owe Mr. Robins a round of applause — .
— or at least a pitcher at the Palms

— for setting out so clearly what I

have merely summarized with ad- ,

mittedly less grace and formal
argumentation. I certainly applaud

the amount of careful thinking he put .

into his letter and am myself in com-
plete support of his position. It is
clearer than crystal that the

presence of women on this campus is ,

indeed the cause of all problems
which we have experienced not only
since 1985 but probably even before.
You can be certain that my name will

be on Mr. Robins’s petition, right —

below his own.

Mr. Robins, those few of us W&L

men left, who truly believe in this

University and in the legacy of |

Robert E. Lee, who endorse the
benefits of honor and gentlemanly
conduct, and who appreciate well-
reasoned and thoughtfully presented
thinking, look forward to a female-

free 1991, and anxiously await the in- ~

stant narcotic euphoria the lifting of
our current pestilence will bring. I
am only sorry that I shall by then be
out in the real world, forced to co-
exist with all the women who live out
there, rather than here in Lexington
and the Eden that shall be reestab-
lished.

Hurray for single-sex W&L and sensible letters

To the Editors:

The best thing about a non-coed W&L will be
the end of the senseless letters about coeducation
that have so cluttered the Phi in recent months.

I’m sure you all know the letters I am talking
about. They are usually three or four paragraphs
(or more) long, have lots of parentheses, and
usually have no point. Furthermore, these let-
ters usually ramble on senselessly and the
writers try to implement as many vocabulary
words as can conceivably fit into sentences in
order to leave some sort of favorable impression
on their fellow students that, because the writer
uses big words, he/she must be of superior in-
telligence. Of course, some clown (or worse, a
group of people) always responds to one of those
letters with a witty one-liner and those really ir-
ritate me.

All in all, then, I think it’s really great that
W&L is going to be a woman’s college.

Dear Marie:

Ihave a problem.

Like you, I am a female. My problem deals
with myself in bed. Not just myself, you under-
stand, but myself with my boyfriend. The pro-
blem with me and my boyfriend is that I keep
faking orgasms. But really, it’s not my problem.

I think it’s his problem. You see, he was cir-
cumcised when he was eight days old, and I read
in Newsweek last week that this operation ac-
tually is not necessary and may not even be
healthy. I fell like I’m missing something, you
know?

Should I see a peer counselor? I’m afraid I'd be
the first one. Did you know that a ‘t’ in the middle
of ‘‘peer’’ spells ‘‘peter’?’’ You’re a dorm
couselor. What should I do?

Should I ask him to get a foreskin graft? I’ve
heard such operations are available. Do they
perform these in the infirmary? What about

Stonewall Jackson Hospital? What does it feel
like to do it with a guy who’s had one? Have you
ever done it with a guy who has? Have you ever
done it with a guy who hasn’t? Should I even tell
my boyfriend about the problem? Should I start
dating a VMI guy or Hampden-Sydney boy? I
know a very nice boy named E. Tracy Humper-
dink III. He’s very gentle.

As you can tell, I’m confused. But I am a
freshman, and I have great SAT scores but no
life, so that’s to be expected, I guess. Please
answer my letter. Please. And just sign me,

The Ring-tum Phi Parody, April 1, 1987

 

 

IECONOLEX,

By Joseph McCythmyass and Del Van Attaboy

The decision to make Washington and Lee all-female is one more
manifestation how an underground Communist network head-
quartered in the Midwestern United States is attempting to undermine
old-fashioned American democracy.

Unlike Virginia, where one must be born and bred to be considered a
“native,” the Midwest is very non-discriminatory. Anyone who has
ever lived in or even flown near the Midwest is considered a corn-
husker.

That is why John Elrod, a native Georgian, is a Midwesterner. So is
University Librarian Barbara Brown, who has worked at Cornell,
Princeton, Stanford and W&L since leaving her Iowa home.

The fact that the Midwest is Communist also is undeniable. After all,

\_ why do you think the invincible Indiana Hoosiers are known as the Big
‘Red Machine? And do you know why they beat the Orangemen of

Syracuse? I’ve been a Hoosier since 1979, and I have irrefutable
evidence that it’s because the Commies bet big money on them.

The Communist infiltration first became noticeable here about four
years ago. According to information obtained by my associate, Del
Van Attaboy, W&L President John D. Wilson not only went to England
during his Rhodes Scholar years but also to the Soviet Union, where he
learned that all institutions — including colleges — ought to be state-
run.

He and the Red Trustees quickly brought more state-loving com-
rades into the University’s bureaucracy and then de-balled us by
bringing in bitches. Recently, they bought the ‘Red House.” Now,
they’ve taken the even more heinous and hegemonic step of making
W&L all-female. Next thing you know, they'll close the milk bar.

Perhaps you're one of those whining weenie wusses who’s wonder-
ing what’s so bad about a coed or even an all-female W&L. Well, let me
tell you.

There once was a time, not too long ago, when we didn’t worry a
whole helluva lot about how smart W&L students were. They just had
to be MEN, i.e., anatomically correct and emotionally stable.

At that time, we MEN could study without being distracted by
female breasts, butts, scents and giggling. Rather than worry about
how we dressed, looked and smelled, we MEN concentrated on being
GENTLEMEN.

We knew that women were made to be looked at and not spoken to,
unless we needed them to do our laundry or fulfill our manly needs. We
knew the advantages of a one-night roll in the hay, but we were wise
enough not to do it every day. We were smart enough to look at these
chicks only one or two mornings a week, not ona daily basis.

And we had a sense of comaraderie because we all dated three or
four different roadchicks at a time without being caught. Those were
the days when men really were MEN.

Those days need not be gone, but we cannot be as wishy-washy as
Rick Robins and merely post a petition. We’ve gotta fight for our
rights. Now is the time for all good MEN to come out of their fraternity
houses and roast the Reds. They raped this university. Let’s rape their
wenches.

Meet in the ODK circle tonight at midnight, baring and bearing
arms, and we will show these Midwestern Commies what God hath

wrought.

The Ring-tum Phi. The staff, elated
by the news, threw a large party in
the Phi office to celebrate the award.
“I’m really psyched about this,”’

The award was presented to the
Phi for their coverage of the Inter-

‘fairs. ‘“‘The amazingly detailed
coverage of IFC meetings and the
good placement of those stories was
very instrumental in our decision,”
said a Pulitzer board official. ‘“‘The
stories left no doubt in the reader’s
mind about what was really going on
with fraternities at Washington and

‘We just wanted to do what we

The Pulitzer official specifically
mentioned the Phi’s investigative
reporting work and editorial cover-
age of the incident during Rush in
which a freshman was injured at
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.

“It was a marvel of accuracy,
fairness and creativity,’’ he said.

Pulitzer prize winning professor of
journalism, and my personal hero,
Clark R. Mollenhoff said, “It’s ob-
vious that the Phi followed my Seven
Basic Rules of sound investigative
reporting, especially rule four, ‘Don’t
exaggerate or distort the facts or the
law.’ ”’

IFC president Christopher B. Sax-
man, who nominated the Phi for the
award, said, “I think it’s great that
those guys are finally getting what
they deserve, and I’m very happy for
them. I’ve supported them from the
very beginning, you know.”

Associate Dean of Students Leroy

think the staff of the Phi was able to
govern themselves. I guess I was
wrong.”

Sex scandal

Wa&L cheerleader linked with Jim Bakker

By JERRY FALWELL
Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee Head
Cheerleader Bambi Stark has been
implicated in yet another scandal in-
volving televangelist Jim Bakker
and his dog Stain.

According to confidential reports,
just two days after winning the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
Cheerleading Championship last
month, which gave them a berth to
the NCAA Cheerleading Contest to be
held in Honolulu in May, Stark and
the remaining W&L cheerleading
squad visited the Bakkers’ multi-
million dollar theme park Heritage,
USA.

While at the theme park, Stark
alleges that the members of the
squad were personally contacted by
Bakker, who asked them if they
would like to visit his multi-million
dollar estate. Stark said she had no
idea that Bakker and his wife Tam-
my Faye would be having ‘‘a wild
party involving things that you would
never imagine possible.”’

Police say that as the other squad
members prepared to leave the par-
ty, Bakker’s dog, named Stain,
“physically assaulted Stark and
prevented her from exiting the
household.”’

Apparently the dog, a chihuahua,
soiled Stark’s black leather dress
beyond repair. When asked why she
was wearing a black leather dress,
Stark replied that she thought the
event was ‘‘a costume party.”’

Although no charges have been fil-
ed as of today, Stark said she is still
considering filing a civil suit against
the Bakkers and their amorous
canine.

Stain Bakker, 77 in human years,
was contacted at the Bakkers’ multi-
million dollar home in Palm Springs
yesterday, but he and his owners
refused to comment on the alleged in-

cident.

Stain, who had been signed by the
Alpo dog food corporation to do a
series of 30-second television com-
mercials for the dog food chain, has
been dropped by the company due to
what they refer to as Stain’s ‘‘total
disregard for public opinion, lack of
judgment, and moral turpitude.”

Alpo has now signed Rev. Jimmy
Swaggart’s dog Blaspheme to
replace Stain as the official Alpo
spokesdog. It was Swaggart who ex-
posed the entire ‘‘Staingate”’ scandal
to the Phi.

 

‘Do-it-yourself’ beginner’s drug plants are now being offered at the W&L
Bookstore. ‘‘Just like the CD’s, the plants can be charged home to Mom and

Dad,” said Tidge Roller, manager.

Oh, definitely! It’s so easy to
care for and can be worn in almost
any situation.

Rumors have been circulating in
the cheerleading world that Stark
might be forced to give up her title as
head cheerleader because of the Bak-
ker incident. These rumors are being
vehemently denied by Stark.

“IT just can’t understand why
anyone would want to discredit me or
the squad just because of one
mistake,’’ she said. ‘‘I only did what I
thought best for the squad.”’

Assistant Head Cheerleader Velma
Goldstein said that although she was
in favor of Stark keeping the title, she

could understand why officials might
want to have a replacement.

“Unfortunately, it might be
necessary to change the tarnished
image of our squad. If it came to a
change in leadership, I would under-
stand and be prepared to take charge
for the sake of the University.”

Stark and other members of the
W&L cheerleading squad said that
they “were just glad it’s all over
with”’ and are gearing up for the May
NCAA cheerleading competition in
Hawaii.

Dart hits Atkins;
saved by a head

By NEAD L. SHARP
Staff Reporter

 

Associate Dean of Students Leroy
C. “Buddy” Atkins was injured this
past weekend while hunting in the
George Washington National Forest.
He was struck by a five-inch blow
dart.

“IT don’t know where it came
from,”’ said Atkins from Stonewall
Jackson Hospital, where he is being
held for observation. ‘“‘The last I
remember I was saying to Brian, ‘Be
vewy, vewy quiet. We’re hunting
wabbit,’ and the next thing I know
I'm lying on my back.”

Brian Shaw, minister of propagan-
da for Washington and Lee, was with
Atkins at the time the incident oc-
curred, ‘I heard someone say, ‘Of
course you know, this means war,’
just before Buddy was hit.”’

Atkins was saved from serious in-
jury because the dart hit him in the
head. He was wearing a thick, red
hunting cap, which allowed the dart

to penetrate only about an inch. Dr.
Bug S. Bunnie, who is treating
Atkins, said, “I think Elmer ...]
mean Buddy... will be fine. The dart
didn’t hit anything important.”’

Bunnie also added, ‘“‘He’s a very
fortunate man. We’ve got him hooked
up to the machine that goes ‘Bing!’”’
Bunnie said that Atkins was now ona
steady diet of creamed carrots and
carrot juice.

Shaw described the unidentified
assailant as about 4 feet 5 inches,
with long ears, buck teeth, gray fur
and a bushy cotton tail. “‘I didn’t real-
ly see enough to tell exactly what it
was,”’ Shaw said.

However, Shaw did hear the at-
tacker say, ‘‘I got that Elmer Fudd
this time!”’

Atkins’ major worry at this time,
he says, is that ‘‘I won’t be able to go
out and tie one on this weekend. I
guess I'll be forced to study or
something. That really makes me
%?*!&? mad!”

The Ring-tum Phi has un-
overed an escort ring operating
jut of one room on the third floor
f Baker Dormitory, dealing ex-
‘lusively with Virginia Military
Institute cadets.

Under the direction of Pulitzer
Prize-winning journalist Clark R.
Mollenhoff, the Phi’s  in-

estigative reporting staff staked
ut Room 333 and questioned the
adets who were spotted leaving
the area

‘We were just visiting some old

iends,’’ said one cadet, who

‘fused to give his name, A Phi
eporter recognized the student’s
iniform decorations as those nor-
mally found on the third-class

adets, who are the equivalent of
ophomores.

rhe intrepid female Phi
reporter followed the third of
Mollenhoff’s Seven Rules of In-
vestigative Reporting, ‘Know

your subject.’’ She followed a
cadet up to the third floor and
vaited for him to exit the room,
irm-in-arm with a W&L woman
student

The reporter then entered the
unlocked but vacant room and
waited until another cadet, who
introduced himself as ‘‘Bull
Moose,’’ came into the room and
asked, ‘So, do you want to eat at
Spanky’s or Estelle’s tonight?”

As the reporter accompanied
| the cadet outside the dorm, she

| asked him how many times he had
been to ‘‘The Room’’ within the

| past six months.

Bull Moose said, “I usually

new mixers next year

Piermont said the necessity of
returning a date by midnight divides
the evening in half.

“T usually drop off my date at the
barracks, then go back to one of the
fraternity parties and find another
guy. But once the administration
phases out coeducation, I’ll have to
just go home by myself,” she said
with tears of anticipated loneliness
spilling out of her eyes, which were
flawlessly made up, just like Tammy
Faye Bakker’s.

Of course, some of the women
students at Washington and Lee have
already begun dealing with any
possible problems that may occur
when no more W&L gentlemen roam
the hallways of the dormitories,
preying upon vulnerable women.

The residents of one non-freshman
dormitory hall have organized small-
scale mixers and socials for par-
ticular groups of cadets, mostly of
the third-class, or sophomore, level.

“Sometimes they aren’t allowed
out of the barracks unless they have
dates, so we go over and escort them
out,”’ said Sharritt Berryl, a W&L
sophomore.

(See related story for details on
escort ring.)

Berryl’s hallmates agree on the
need for relaxed barracks regula-
tions to facilitate inter-campus
socialization.

‘“‘We’ve had to break up or leave
dozens of parties just to let the guys
get back in time,” said Berryl’s
roommate, Ilsa Frusen-gladbag.

“It really chafes our social life,”’
Frusen-gladbag concluded.

least one of the two nights. I’ve

As the two approached the en-
trance to Spanky’s, the reporter
decided to follow another of
Mollenhoff’s Seven Rules: Rule
Five, “Deal straight across the
board with your sources and in-
vestigation subjects alike.’’ She
told Bull Moose that she was not
an official escort, but asked for his
help in learning the true story
behind the service.

Bull agreed to speak to the Phi,
but on the condition his real name
not be used.

“The two girls who are the
leaders of the ring are Sharritt
Berryl and Ilsa Frusen-gladbag,
who live in Room 333. They have
been making contacts over at VMI
since the beginning of the school
year. They didn’t really start the
service officially until the end of
September.

“See, some of the disciplinary
punishments that the cadets
receive forbid them to leave the
post unless their date comes to get
them. Sharritt and Ilsa arrange
for girls to be available as
escorts.”

When asked who the girls were,
Bull said, ‘I guess they’re W&L
students, but sometimes I think
Sharritt imports some of her
friends from outside of Lexington.
You know, to add a new face now
and then.”’

tory, she reached an answering
machine. The message on that
machine consisted only of the

Raped men to gather

By HONEY MONEY
Staff Reporter

 

The Interfraternity Council and the
Women’s Forum will co-sponsor a
mandatory wallet-rape seminar for
all freshmen on Monday at 8 p.m. in
the Warnhim Center.

Participants will be divided
according to gender. IFC represen-
tatives will discuss with the men how
to prevent wallet rape, while WF
members will teach the women how
to empty a wallet efficiently and ef-
fectively. The men and women then
will come together to learn about
what the other sex discovered.

Wallet rapes occur at an orgasmic
rate on college campuses nationwide,
according to University Psychologist
Jim Worth. And since the advent of
coeducation at W&L, this campus has
been no exception.

Legally, a wallet rape occurs any
time a man is forced against his bet-
ter judgment to spend money on a
woman or when he is incapable of
making a decision about how much
money to spend. Although wallet
rape is illegal, it is difficult to prove
in court, and most men are too em-
barrassed to file charges.

“Statistics show that about 80 per-
cent of all college women could be in-
dicted on wallet-rape charges,” said

Associate Dean of Students Anne
C.P. Schroer. ‘‘Women clearly are
making great strides in gaining
equality against these  over-
aggressive, sex-driven males.”’

‘Most men think, ‘No, it couldn’t
happen to me. I’m too much of a
stud,’” said IFC President Chris Sax-
man, who has admitted to having
been wallet-raped on more than one
oocasion. ‘‘Perhaps this program
will help them understand that it
even happens to guys like me.”’

Wallet rapes may occur when
either men or women are trying to
get some action. Both types have oc-
turred on this campus.

“It was terrible,’ said Hugh Get-
nun, a junior engineering major from
Wheeling, W.Va., as he recounted the
time he was wallet-raped.

“I'd spent loads on this chick. I
bought her flowers, took her out to
dinner, took her to a movie, bought
some booze. We're talkin’ an easy 60
bucks. I deserved to get some,
y know?

“So we went back to my room, put
on some music and fooled around.
Pretty soon we were in bed, naked.
Slowly, she began kissing my neck
and working her way down, inch by
inch. She ran her fingers slowly
across my chest and then down my
sides.

‘““Oh boy,’ I thought. ‘Here it com-
es.” I was hard as an organic test.

Bhagwan Rajneeshpuram, the In-
dian guru/cult leader who led a
group of followers numbering in the
hundreds to a small Oregon com-
munity two years ago, has announc-
ed plans to move his religious cult to
Buena Vista, Va.

If all goes according to schedule,
the Bhagwan and his followers could
arrive in the small mountain com-
munity as soon as next week.

The followers, who consist of
vagrants and hermits as well as
Bhagwan worshippers, are believed
to number around 300. Currently,
Buena Vista’s population hovers near
7,000.

Many residents of Buena Vista are
“seared and afraid” of the coming
onslaught of what they call “‘hippies,
dope addicts, and devil worship-
pers.”

Willard Templeton, 73, fears that
the Bhagwan followers will infiltrate
the local government and change
Buena Vista’s name to Bhagwan
Vista, a common rumor circulating
throughout the town.

“Them people are just different
and frankly, they scare the livin’ hell
out of me,”’ he said. Templeton said
that he had heard about the name
change from city officials in Buena
Vista.

Rajneeshpuram, who was con-
tacted while checking his baggage at
the New Delhi International Airport
in India, said he had no intentions of
changing Buena Vista’s name to
Bhagwan Vista.

“T only want to spread peace, love
and harmony throughout the Shenan-
doah Valley. Besides, we don’t have
enough people to change the name...
yet,” he chuckled.

Not all Buena Vista residents are in
fear of the soon-to-arrive cult,
however. Daisy Petals, 38, says she
“can’t wait’ to meet the Bhagwan,
adding that she hopes to join his com-
mune if possible.

“T’ve been a big fan of his for quite
some time,’’ she said. ‘I can’t
believe everyone here is so upset.
The Bhagwan only wants peace and
harmony. We should be honored that
he chose us.”’

The Bhagwan, who left the U.S.
last year after a large sex scandal hit
his Oregon commune, said he chose

Buena Vista in part because of its
proximity to his ‘favorite decadent

THE BHAGWAN

college, Washington and Lee Univer-
sity.”

“TI chose Bhagwan, er, I mean
Buena Vista because of Washington
and Lee. Spirits told me in a dream
that I must go there and reach out to
them,” he said.

Rajneeshpuram, who plans to set
up his headquarters at Southern
Seminary, said he looks forward to
throwing a ‘‘big party’’ to celebrate
his arrival.

The Bhagwan, who owns almost
100 Rolls Royce automobiles, says he
will hold a raffle and give one of the
cars away at the scheduled “big par-
ty’’ next month.

“T feel it is time to educate the
residents of Buena Vista and
Washington and Lee as to the ways of
my people,” the Bhagwan said.

 

And then right after she got past my
belly button, she picked up her head,
looked me right in the eye, shouted
‘Psyche,’ put on her clothes and left.

“Tt was like putting a stopper on a
faucet, turning on the water full-
blast, and then right when the
pressure’s about to make it explode,
turning the water off again. Wow,
what a bitch.”

Andrew D. Asholl, a senior from St
Louis, also has been wallet-raped.

“It supposedly was just a friend}y
dinner date,’ Asholl said. ‘‘Wed
planned to go out for some throwin’
food, then hit some frat parties. But
when I went to her room to get her,
there she was in a damned evening
gown. She said some friends had in-
vited us out toa nice restaurant.

“Nice and expensive. But being a
W&L gentleman, what was I suppos-
ed to do? She even made me buy her
drinks without ever offering to pay,
and then she got really horny. Now
this babe was all right for a friendly

date, but she wasn’t exactly the type |

you want to wake up with the next
morning. It was like just because I
paid out all this money, I somehow
owed her something. What a bitch.”’
Women will be admitted to the
seminar free. The cost for men is on-
ly two dollars. Those who miss the
forum will be required to do service

work in the dining hall, Schroer said. ,

Anti-rape

protection

expanded

By LOTTA WATTS

The administration is taking steps
to ensure a bright future for the new ,

single-sex Washington and Lee.

The board of trustees announced '

Monday that the University’s
lighting system will be expanded to
make the campus safer for the all-
female student body.

In addition, the board has created a
new administrative position, termed
the dean of enlightenment. No one
seems to know exactly what the new

dean will be responsible for, but ad-

ministrators say they are unsure
what any of the deans do, for that
matter.

Plans are currently being discuss-
ed as to the placement of the new
lights. ‘“‘We believe a balance can be
achieved between safety and tradi-
tion,’’ said a spokesman for the
board. ‘‘The beauty of this school is
that

it can accommodate these '

changes while still retaining the °

essence of the tradition that has sus-
tained it for solong.”’

The lights installed two years ago ‘
at the advent of coeducation will be ,

replaced by ultramodern neon lights

of the type often used to illuminate ~

highways near downtown Miami.
The actual number of lights is uncer-

tain, but estimates range from 75 to |
100 for the front and back of the Col- .

onnade.

Tuition increases will be necessary
to finance the enlightenment of W&L. °
This year’s increase is expected to ,

outpace inflation by two percent.
“The board considered every

reasonable option before adopting

next year’s tuition figure,’’ outgoing

president John D. Wilson said shortly ‘

after the decision was made. ‘‘But
then we decided, ‘What the hell.
They’re rich, they can afford it.’ ”’

almost 200 years with approximately
700 people, most of whom are still at-

Frank Parsons, executive assis-
tant to the president, indicated that
the board has called for the removal
of several statues in its efforts to
emasculate W&L.

The first thing that must go, Par-
sons said, is the statue of George
Washington on top of Washington
Hall. Parsons said the trustees know
an artist who is willing to do a statue
of Martha relatively cheap.

Urinal yields North’s shredded documents

By SAM DONALDSON
Staff Reporter

 

Professor Clark Mollenhoff has
always been noted for big things. His
journalism students can attest to
that.

Now Mollenhoff has uncovered
what may be W&L’s biggest find
since the Midwest. Some in the upper
echelon of American politics view the
Mollenhoff discovery of more than
10,000 pages of shredded documents
telating to “Iranscam”’ left by Lt.
Col. Oliver North as the next
Watergate. Initially, one thing is cer-
tain: like the man, ““Boomergate’’ is
sure to be big.

The discovery of the documents
came soon after the February 25 visit

, of North and his daughter to the

Washington and Lee campus. North

and his daughter, an applicant to
W&L, were given a tour of the cam-
pus. Enter Mollenhoff.

A former investigative reporter for
the Des Moines Register and a win-
ner of the 1958 Pulitzer Prize for na-
tional reporting, Mollenhoff was once
again true to his investigative
nature. Unbeknownst to most
students — even to North himself
— Mollenhoff trailed the former
policy-maker and his daughter from
the moment they arrived on campus
in an effort to expose the truth about
North’s visit.

His lucky break came when North
entered the men’s bathroom on the
second floor of Reid Hall. Sensing
there was something suspicious
about the unexpected stop, Mollen-
hoff discreetly followed North into
the facility and observed him shred-
ding what has been estimated to be

11,000 pages of documents into the
urinal.

Hiding himself under the sink until
North washed his hands and left,
Mollenhoff then fished out the shred-
ded documents before they were
flushed in what now seems to have
been an effort to avoid ‘“‘yellow’’ jour-
nalism.

With journalism secretary
Florence Cook providing scotch tape
and fingernail polish, Mollenhoff
literally pieced together a part of the
puzzle that Justice Department of-
ficials say may provide the missing
link to the Buena Vista bank account
that was used for funnelling money to
Sri Lanka via Boise, Idaho, that was
to be used in the contras’ battle
against gum disease in Nicaragua.

Mollenhoff refused to speculate on
the nature of the documents, citing
the ongoing closed Justice Depart-

ment investigations and a general
distrust of the press as a source of his
disillusionment with the First
Amendment.

He did, however, mention that the
recent events will be the subject of
this week’s ‘‘Retrospect, with Clark
R. Mollenhoff.”” Two books relating
Mollenhoff’s experience, Investigative
Plumbing and Ollie-n-Me, are ex-
pected to be released later this week.

North declined to comment on the
situation, citing the Fifth Amend-
ment as ‘‘as good a reason as any.”
An official statement from the White
House has not been made available,
though an anonyme "source who
asked to be identified’caly as ‘‘D’’
said that the president, when asked
about the affair, cited the Fifth
Amendment and then proceeded to
hurl epithets such as “fink” and
“‘goob”’ at an effigy of Mollenhoff.

Dome-Mania!

By JACK STRAP
Staff Reporter

 

First it was the Astrodome, and
then the Superdome, the Kingdome,
the Silverdome, the Carrier Dome
and the Dean Dome. Now comes the
irrival of a dome to end all domes

Washington and Lee Athletic
Director Bill McHenry announced
Monday that the Board of Trustees
had accepted the Athletic Depart-
ment’s proposal for the building of a
domed stadium on the W&L campus.
he construction of the new stadium,
to be called the GeneralsDome, was
started Monday and will continue at
break-neck speed for the next six
months. The site for the dome will
cover the area in which Liberty Hall,
Smith Field and the Student Ac-
tivities Pavilion are now located.

“This (the GeneralsDome] will be
awesome,’’ exclaimed McHenry, get-
ting a tad bit excited about the
limitless athletic possibilities the
dome offers. ‘It’s going to have
every technological advancement
that you could possibly imagine.”

Some features of the new dome,
which will cost $900 million, include a
150,000 person seating capacity, a
retractable roof which will allow for
the installation of a natural grass
playing surface, an indoor shopping
mall, a 24-lane bowling alley, a roller
skating rink, an olympic-size swim-
ming pool, 17 hot tubs, a massage
parlor, and offices and equipment for
the entire W&L athletic department
staff.

“We are going to have some ab-
solutely incredible athletic and even
social events at our dome,’’ said
McHenry. ‘I have already sent in our
applications to host the 1991 NCAA
Final Four basketball tournament,

the 1993 Super Bowl, and the 1992
World Cup soccer finals.

‘Hell, we may even have the Olym-
pics here if we can pull a few
strings.”

NCAA officials refused to confirm
whether or not the GeneralsDome
would be chosen as a Final Four site
but did say that Lexington was “‘high
on our list considering the facilities it
will be able to provide.”

The flexibility of the dome will be
exploited to its fullest, said McHenry,
as many athletic and non-athletic
events are on the slate for the upcom-
ing year. The schedule for the 1987-88
school year contains such activities

as: World Wrestling Federation’s
“Wrestlemania IV’’; women’s mud
wrestling; super moto-cross;

monster truck competition; SABaid
— a rock concert featuring Genesis,
The Who, The Rolling Stones, Bruce
Springsteen and many other per-
formers with all proceeds going to
the financially strapped Student Ac-
tivities Board; Ringling Bros. Bar-
num and Bailey Circus; box
lacrosse; and a special edition of the
popular game show ‘Wheel of For-
tune.”’

“T’m sick and tired of hearing com-
plaints about how there is nothing to
do around here,”’ said President John
D. Wilson. ‘I think this will definitely
liven things up and provide some
diverse entertainment for the W&L
community.”’

With 150,000 seats to fill and a cur-
rent student enrollment of only 1,700,
fans will have to come from
somewhere other than the Lexington
and Rockbridge area.

“No problem,’’ said McHenry.
‘With all W&L sports to be held in the
dome [except cross-country and ten-
nis], the other athletic fields and
buildings can be converted for other
purposes.’

who travel by car, Route 60 will be
widened to six lanes from the

GeneralsDome to Route 64 to help

“The changes will take time,’’ said
McHenry, ‘‘but if everything goes as
planned, we're looking at a great
number of people marking Lex-
ington, Virginia on their vacation
agendas.”’

Student reactions to the complete

overhaul of W&L athletics were
somewhat mixed.

“I think it’s pretty cool,” said
sophomore Harry M. Eye III. “I’ve
never seen women’s mud wrestling
before but I hear it’s degrading to

women. I want to check that stuff
out.”’

“What’s the point in having a

dome?”’ asked freshman Art Phagg.
“T wish they would use the money for

something more worthwhile, like a |

new theatre.”

“Let’s hope they can serve beer
there without some garden or what-
not,’’ said sophomore Jimmy Slush.
“I’m tired of not being able to down a
few cold ones while I’m watching my

Washington and Lee ends the Division Ill ‘charade’

 

By STEELE TRAVERS
Staff Reporter

 

In an emergency meeting held last
weekend the Washington and Lee
Board of Trustees decided that, ef-
fective in the next academic year, all
W&L athletic teams will compete in
Division I.

Concurrent with this decision, the
trustees also announced that W&L
will reinstitute athletic scholarships
beginning in the fall of 1987.

“We held the emergency meeting
at the request of [W&L] president
{John D.] Wilson,’ explained a
trustee who asked not to be iden-
tified. “It seems that he saw the
president of SMU talking on T.V.
about how much money Division I

athletics had brought into his school.

“He [Wilson] felt that it would be
best for W&L to be in a position to
make as much money as SMU and
the trustees agreed with him.”’

Wilson declined to specify how the
University would spend the addi-
tional money but he hinted that there
would be immediate benefit to the
general student population. ‘‘I think
we could expand the menu in the Co-
op,” said Wilson.

The decision took most of the W&L
community by surprise, including
most of the coaches. Still, reaction in
the athletic department was, for the
most part, positive.

“It’s about time,’ said W&L
Athletic Director Bill McHenry. ‘TI
was getting tired of pussyfooting
around in Division III.”’

Huskers ‘shucked’ as
darters wing way to win

 

By HANS HACKER-PSCHORR
staff Reporter

 

With most of its Old Dominion
Athletic Conference games still left
to play, the Washington and Lee lawn
jarts team is looking for one of its
vest finishes ever. The Generals (4-0,
2-0 in ODAC games) seem to have
hings well under control, already
securing wins against ODAC powers
toanoke and Emory & Henry, as
yell as a shocking 6-3 victory over
he nationally ranked, and previously
inbeaten, Nebraska Cornhuskers
esterday at Wilson Field.

Generals head coach Norm Lord
vas elated after yesterday’s surprise
rictory over Nebraska. The Corn-
iuskers were ranked fifth in the
VCAA Division I poll which was
eleased on Tuesday afternoon.

“They [the Cornhuskers] only
layed us because they had a slot to
ill on their schedule,”’ said Lord.
They brought their air-conditioned
us and their number-five ranking to
exington, only to see our boys turn
he match into a highlight film!”

The Generals set the tone for the
iatch early in the first game. Both
on Thornton and Skip Bertram con-
‘ibuted crucial ringers that allowed
/&L to take the first game 21-6 and
stablish an initial lead.

“IT knew then that we had a

vance,’’ said Bertram. ‘““They were

»viously frustrated and we got them

it of their game plan.”

The General wingers won the next
vo games and then the teams split
ie next two to make the score of the

atch 4-1

The Cornhuskers then staged a ral-

which almost robbed the young
enerals of the victory. Scraping by
ith a combined score of 42-37, the

braska team took the next two

making the score of the

atch 4-3. The Generals seemed to
slipping

Then a loud outburst from Lord

mes

electrified the crowd of approximate-
ly 7,100 and caused an emotional
turning point.

‘‘What I said was that we were still
in the thing,” said Lord. ‘‘They were
going to get hot dogs and they were
going to the toilets. Some were even
leaving. It was pride time. We need-
ed them behind us!”’

With the yells of the crowd, and the
occasional ‘‘wave’’ to cheer them on,
the Generals crushed Nebraska in
the final two games and took the
match 6-3.

It was a victory reminiscent of the
“glory years”’ for W&L lawn darting
in the 1950s. Those were the days
when the Generals ruled the sport as
the nation’s premier Division I pro-
gram.

“God bless the Lord and this fine
group of men,” said a teary-eyed
Vince Dunhill. Dunhill was the cap-
tain of the 1953 Generals team that
captured the national championship.

“They played with their hearts on
their sleeves. It [watching the
General victory] made me proud to
be an American,”’ he said as several
thousand jubilant fans swarmed the
field to congratulate the General
wingers.

Although pre-season conference
polls ranked the Generals at No. 4
they will be the favorites entering the
remainder of their scheduled ODAC
contests, because of their excep-
tionally strong start against quality
teams.

Lord attributes the team’s success
to superior conditioning, a lack of
serious injuries, and understanding
of ‘‘simple trajectory’’ that is so im-
portant in lawn darting.

The Generals will face their
toughest ODAC challenge next week
when they travel to Farmville for the
traditional showdown with Hamp-
den-Sydney

“Our main goal, of course, is to
win,’”’ said Lord, ‘‘but it sure would
be nice to pay those suckers back by
spoiling their homecoming.”

field felt that the move was long over-
due. ‘‘I just can’t wait to put W&L
back on the Division I basketball
map. I’ve been just aching for a
chance to take that [North Carolina
head coach] Dean Smith down a
notch or two.”’

Some coaches, however, did ex-
press concern.

Said head football coach Gary
Fallon, ‘“‘Considering the decision to
go all female [see story, page one], I
thought that it would be hard enough
to field a winning football team in
Division III.

‘‘But in Divison I, with no men, it’s
going to be near to impossible. All I
can hope is that we’ll get a bunch of
transfers from Mary Baldwin.”

Even Dean Buddy Atkins had
something to say about the change.
“This ?!$?$?! Division III charade

 

The returning starters can still
remember the tough loss to
Hampden-Sydney last year that
dashed the Generals’ hopes for a
possible NCAA play-off berth.

“That loss still keeps me awake
some nights,”’ said co-captain John
Packett, a junior from Salem, Va.

But, he added, ‘‘the coaches have
done a super job in prepping us for
those. matches. They show us weak-
nesses when we look at the game
films, and we have been able to key

has gone on long enough. It’s about
!2$2$?! time that someone did
something.”

For those who haven’t heard the
story, W&L competed in Division I
until the mid-1950s when a scandal
within the athletic department made
the school decide to discontinue
athletic scholarships. Then, when the
National Collegiate Athletic Associa-
tion created a division for schools
that didn’t award scholarships —
Division III — W&L joined almost
immediately.

“I was very excited when I heard
that the decision had been made,”
said McHenry, ‘‘but now it’s down to
the business of recruiting.

“I’m heading west with a bagful of
scholarships on Monday. There’s this
one swimmer from Duluth who says

on these weaknesses. There have
been very few surprises.”

The match will be held next Satur-
day afternoon at 3 p.m.

**WINGER RINGERS * *

With 42 points in yesterday’s game,
Bertram has reached No. 3 on the
W&L all-time leading scorers list
with 15,389. He needs only 736 more
points to pass Reginald “Whizzer”
Gillispie, who holds the mark with
16,124.

she’ll come here if we give her a con-
do at Borden Commons. I’m going to
try to talk her down to a suite in
Gaines Hall.”’

When asked if there could be a
repeat of the type of scandal that
originally caused the school to drop
scholarships, McHenry replied, ‘No
way, We’ve learned our lesson.”’

Student reaction to the move was
immediate and positive. Cotton
Smithers, a junior from Atlanta, Ga.,
said, ‘‘This will be great. Maybe now
we can get some real tailgate par-
ties.”

Jones Baker, a freshman from
Louisville, Ky., said, ‘“‘Now that
we’re Division I and all, I think it’s
about time that we got some
cheerleaders. I think that it would
boost attendance if we saw some

cheese in skimpy costumes.”’

Georgia Harper, a sophomore from
Jessup, Tenn., said, ‘It was only a
matter of time until something like
this happened. I just hope Daddy
sends me enough money for season
tickets.”

Some students, however, did ex-
press reservations.

Said Leonard TuBright, a junior
from Plainfield, Kan., ‘Does this
mean that the debating team will go
Division I also? It would be really
neat if we got to go to the national
finals in Morgantown, W.Va.”’

In conjunction with the Division I
decision, the trustees also voted to
begin construction on a new multi-
million dollar stadium to be called
the GeneralsDome [see story on this
page].

The big guns were out last night at
Cy Twombly pool for the 23rd
Washington and Lee Invitational
Bellyflop Contest.

More than 850 people crowded into
the pool gallery to watch some of the
sport’s biggest narhes compete for
the $25,000 first-place prize.

Robert D. “Stringbean’” deMaria
walked away with the big purse, for
the fourth time in as many years, by
winning both the compulsory and

perfect scores of 10.

“Obviously I’m very happy about

Competition figured to be tight this

because of our exposure on TV game
shows.”

Miller, who had earlier estimated
the playing fields would be ready for
action by the fall season, said he saw
no reason why the University
wouldn’t sell the fields.

“(The University] would be crazy
not to,”’ said Miller. ‘‘There’s no con-
ceivable way those fields will be
ready in time for the fall sports
season.

“Besides that, the University
would turn a nice profit on the whole
deal, Rice-a-Roni is offering $600,000
and the fields only cost us about 170
grand.”

Chung said the company wants the
fields because of their ‘incredible
ability to hold water for a long period
of time.” Rice grows extremely well
in wet environments.

$100,000.

“It will be a good experience for
us,’’ said head coach Bill Washburn,
whose team finished with a 1-9 record
last year. “The girls will benefit
greatly from playing against the dif-
ferent international style.’ The
Europeans play mainly from the
baseline while Washburn says the
Generals go with the “serve and
volley” power game.

“This is not going to be a vacation.
We plan to play tennis and lots of it.
I’ve already scheduled two half-hour
practice sessions.”

The University said last year’s ex-
cursion was paid for by the athletic
department because the team, in just
its first year of existence, didn’t have
enough time in the fall to raise funds.
This season, however, the women did
partake in some money-making ac-
tivities.

‘‘We sold bumper stickers and can-
dy bars but we came up just a little
bit short of our goal,’’ said
sophomore Valerie Pierson. ‘‘We
also had a car wash and cookie-and-

“The drainage systems on these
fields are remarkable,” said Chung.
“One most fields of this type, the
water would run right off. But in this
case, the water reamins for months
ata time.

“One rainfall could conceivably
carry us through an entire growing
season.”

The fields were supposed to pro-
vide scheduling and practice flex-
ibility for the numerous W&L athletic
teams and clubs. Miller stated
earlier the fields would be ‘‘techno-
logically advanced” and contain
superior water-drainage systems.

“T don’t know what exactly went
wrong, but the University comes out
over $400,000 richer for the mishap,”’
he said. ‘‘I think I’ll spend my share
on a trip to the Bahamas.”

cake-bake sale during the second
week of October.”’

The squad raised $62.31 for its ef-
forts, so the University decided to
“step in” and provide a “‘little help.”

‘We Want only the best for our
women’s athletic teams,’’ said
Athletic Director Bill McHenry. “In
order for us to become the best, we
have to play against the best.

“The men’s teams are already
established so we have to show some
favoritism towards the women. I see
nothing wrong with this trip in terms
of unfairness to the other teams. The
baseball and lacrosse teams go to
Florida every year, right?”

According to Sports Information
Director Mark Mandel, the decision
to pay the tennis team’s way was a
unanimous one.

ferson ‘‘J-Bone”’ Harralson.

deMaria, who has won the contest
eight of the last 11 years, was the ob-
vious crowd favorite. Emerging from
the lockerroom in pink flowered
Jams, deMaria was met with the
chant ‘“‘Stringbean, Stringbean’’
from the capacity crowd.

Working from the three-meter
board, the competition opened with
the compulsory round. In the com-
pulsories, each bellyflopper is ex-
pected to execute to perfection three
dives: the swan-dive bellyflop, the
cannonball and a flip with a horizon-
tal landing.

Shillington was the first diver and
executed a perfect swan-dive belly-
flop. As he has done since the first
meet in 1964, Shillington dove in his
trademark outfit of cut-off jeans and
what he calls his ‘good luck
Hawaiian shirt.”

The remainder of the compulsories
was mundane, with the exception of
deMaria’s three perfect dives. Har-
ralson was disqualified after the
compulsory round for not meeting
the mandatory eight-inch water
displacement requirement.

“‘T figured I'd do really well in the
compulsories,”’ said Mollenhoff, ‘‘but
Stringbean really tore up those
dives.”’

“Geez, I’ve never seen anyone dive
like that,”’ said Packett. ‘‘I think Str-
ingbean must be possessed.’

After the compulsories, deMaria
was in first place with a score of 10,
followed by Shillington (9.6), Packett
(9.2), Horridge (8.7), Drake (8.5) and
Mollenhoff (6.4).

“T guess I'll have to bring out my
best stuff early in the freestyle if I
stand a chance of catching up with
Stringbean,’’ Mollenhoff said.

Three freestyle competition is
what brings the crowds back year
after year. Each diver is allowed
three dives in which to prove his ar-
tistic flair, originality and water
displacement ability.

“The compulsories are all right,’
said observer Greg Louganis, ‘“‘but
what I really come to see is these
fellas get off in the freestyles.”

Mollenhoff opened the freestyle
round with an amazing “double back
flip flop’”’ that earned him a near-
perfect score of 9.9. Drake matched
that score with an inverted flip with 2
1/2 twists and an amazing 12-inch
water displacement.

Packett was the day’s leader in
water displacement and Horridge’s
originality won him the admiration of
many of the fans.

“After watcning Suringbean dive, I
knew I didn’t have a prayer,” Hor-
ridge said. ‘‘I look at the competition
today as a learning experience. I'll
be back next year with more polished
compulsories and a few new dives for
the freestyles.’’

deMaria, it seems, never looked
back after establishing his lead in the
compulsories. His first dive, a double
flip with a half-twist, earned him his
fourth of six perfect 10’s and
restarted the ‘‘Stringbean’’ chant.

His second dive, called by bellyflop
experts the best in history, was a tri-
ple inward flip with three twists and
a water displacement of 14 inches.

“‘T knew I had it sewn up with that
dive,’’ deMaria said later.

A double back flip by deMaria end-
ed the day’s competition and earned
him the $25,000 purse. Mollenhoff
made an amazing comeback in the
freestyles and finished second with a
score of 9.9.

Following Mollenhoff were Packett
(9.75), Horridge (9.43), Shillington
(9.167) and Drake (9.03).

Shillington said this might be his
last year but added, ‘‘Hell, I’ve been
saying that for the last 12 years.”

Next year’s circuit opens up with
the Southern California Tournament
in Pasadena on Nov. 17.

FD plans announced

 

wee
By EARNEST PUDDING
Entertainment Editor

 

According to Glynn Alexander,
head of the Student Activities Board,
Fancy Dress preparations are
already well under way

With an estimated budget of $4.6
million, the SAB plans to throw one
bally-hoo of a Fancy Dress next year
Not only are top-flight acts going to
be signed, but also new, more
elaborate themes are being propos-
ed

“Basically, we plan to throw a Fan-

y Dress that will definitely prompt
the board of trustees to withdraw ab-
solutely all their support,’ Alex-
ander said. ‘‘At least that’s our inten-
tion. If Washington and Lee ever has
another Fancy Dress, then we will
have failed. I mean, hey, it’s our last
year as a coed institution.”

Next year’s exorbitant budget is
the result of the hard work of newly
elected SAB money-raisers Oral
Roberts and Bedroom Athlete Jim
Bakker. Roberts used a particularly
novel fund raising technique where
he said in a news release that he
would kill himself violently with a
‘hainsaw if he raises more than $3
million.

“The response was incredible,”
Alexander said. ‘‘Calls and pledges
just kept pouring in. Everyone kept
saying something about ‘the Lord’s
work.’ I don’t know. God must really
love W&L.”’

Already, the SAB has managed to
sign Zamphyr and his beautiful Pan
Flute as the Thursday night act
Opening band will be Bon Jovi and
his wooden arm

In addition, the ball will be held in
the newly erected GeneralsDome

As for beer, Alexander regreted
that no alcoholic beverages will be
allowed at the ball.

‘We're just trying to do our part to
cut down on all the drunk driving,”’
Alexander said.

However, crack, heroin and co-
caine are welcome narcotic embell-
ishments

“We just want people to have a
good time,’’ Alexander added.

The SAB has already selected a
number of proposed F'D themes.

At the top of the list is “Swamp
Thing.’ The GeneralsDome will be
turned into a steaming quagmire
complete with corpses obtained from
the Roanoke morgue and real live
alligators slithering through the

knee-deep water.

 

 

en yy

Next is ‘‘My Favorite Shades of
Blue.’ Alexander was somewhat
obscure on the details of this pro-
posal.

“A Nightmare on Elm Street,”’ is
currently an SAB favorite. A ‘“‘run for
your life and make sure you take it
easy on your intake of hallucin-
ogenics”’ affair, Alexander hopes to
decrease drastically the number of
anti-SAB sympathizers with this one

For “A Night in El Salvador,”
Alexander plans to recreate the over-
whelming impact of the recent hit
movie, Platoon.

“Only, it will be more real, I guess
you could say,’ Alexander added
vaguely.

With the advent of an all-woman
W&L, the SAB has picked out several
themes appropriate for this new
move. They include “A Night at
Hugh Hefner’s,’’ “Slumber Party”
and ‘‘Panty Raid!”’

But that’s not all. Still in the works
are plans for a ‘‘Famous Siamese
Twin Motorcycle Dare-Devil Team”
Fancy Dress Ball, as well as ‘‘An
Evening with the Spanish Inquisi-
tion.”

“As you can see, this is no wimp-
out, half-assed ball,’’ Alexander said.
‘Come at your own risk.”’

The Beatles

New group could make it

guess you really gotta hear it to
believe it.
Apparently, I’m not the only one

 

By TAMI JUNE LETTERBUTT
Pop Music Critic

 

Bon Jovi is probably the best rock
and roll band in the world. Hey, let’s
face it: they might be the best there
ever was. I don’t need to tell you that,
but this might interest you. I heard a
record by a new English band that,
though they might not be better than
Bon Jovi, could very well prove to be
better than, say, Duran Duran. Or
Boston.

They are called the Beatles and
they hail from Liverpool. Now, they
are obviously riding on the tailcoats
of that other Liverpool band, Frankie
Goes To Hollywood (although this
new band’s album covers aren’t
nearly as cool), but that isn’t quite
fair since the Beatles don’t have a
synthesizer player, as hard as that
might be to believe. Neither does
Frankie Goes To Hollywood, by the
way, but who says a pop group should
have to play their own instruments?

These Beatles evidently do play
their instruments, though, according
to the liner notes of their new album,
Meet The Beatles. (It was just releas-
ed on CD, tbough the sound quality is
strange — like it’s all coming from
one speaker or something.) It’s just
guitars and drums, sort of like U2 or
Stryper, but less... loud, I guess.
Weirdest thing is the way the drums
are recorded — as if the drummer
were in another room. And the
guitars, come to think of it, are pretty
strange, too: so quiet. It makes me
wonder how they expect to play these
songs on video. I mean, the drum-
mer’s so mellow and all, it doesn’t
sound like he can hold his hand over
his head and crash down on the snare
drum with his hair flying, which he’ll
have to do if he’s going to be on a rock
video, as we all very well know. And
how are these guitarists going to
grimace with pain if there aren’t any
loud solos?

But these are minor problems on a
really cool record. The first song, ‘‘I
Want To Hold Your Hand,’’ sounds
like it could be a real hit. It sounds
sort of like the Romantics, or maybe
Men At Work, what with the hand-
clapping and all. Another song, ‘‘Till
There Was You,” reminds me of my
very favorite band, Spandau Ballet.
It’s the ballad and it is almost as good
as ‘‘True.”’ Of course, it isn’t surpris-
ing that they remind me of Spandau
Ballet, because their look — short
hair, nice suits, clean shaves — is ob-
viously lifted from the Spandaus.

Several of these guys are really
cute, by the way. One, named Paul
McCartney, is particularly cute and
could rival Duran Duran’s John
Taylor as the cutest bass player in
rock.

The whole record is great. The
songs keep going around and around
in my head, and the lyrics seem
halfway intelligent. Which is okay,
because I like them anyway. In fact,
I’m kind of at a loss about why I do
like them so much. It sort of sounds
like everything else these days, but
somehow more... more thought out. I
don’t know. And another strange
thing is that you can really dance to it
even though it isn’t Dance Music. I

who likes the Beatles. According to
the liner notes, they are huge in
England — almost as big as Wham!
used to be, although I’m sure that’s

stretching it a bit. One problem: so-
meone told me that their lead singer,
John Lennon, is dead. Then some-
body else said, ‘‘But no, Paul is
dead.”’ Strange indeed. Next think
you know, people will be saying that
Jon Bon Jovi has a wooden arm.

 

Bruce Springsteen played the Student Activities Pavilion last Saturday
night to a small, unenthusiastic crowd. Said one concertgoer, ‘‘This Spring- ,
steen guy is just too dull. When will the SAB get somebody good? Like Boy
Jour?” Here, Springsteen's sax player Clarence Clemens is shown on stage,
the effects of his AIDS disease readily apparent.
