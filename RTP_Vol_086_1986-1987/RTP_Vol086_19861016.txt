EC will not endorse
trial support group

 

By VALERIE PIERSON
Staff Reporter
Pc

 

| The Executive Committe on Mon-
day night refused to endorse the pro-
posed support group for students ac-
cused of honor violations. In a
unanimous vote, EC members decid-
ed against Dr. James Worth’s pro-
posal, but they encouraged him not to
abandon the idea completely.

Dr. Worth began the discussion
Monday night by inviting the EC
Members to participate in the sup-
Port group in any capacity they

thought necessary.

Jim Humphreys, the third-year
law representative, asked if this
8roup could give the faculty any con-
trol over the honor system. Worth
Tesponded ‘‘absolutely not.” He said
this group’s sole purpose would be to

1 compassionately with students
harged with honor violations.

Louise Phipps-Senft, the second-

ear law representative, questioned

need for such a group. She
inted out that there are other
eans of emotional support, in-
luding dormitory counselors and the
fessionals employed by the uni-
ersity,

In an interview, junior represen-

tive Brad Root echoed these ideas.

Ost people accused of honor viola-

ns would prefer the support and

 

dvice of close friends over that of a

jomplete stranger, he said. After

consulting classmates, Root said he
thought the general consensus was
that better means of handling the
stress surrounding honor trials ex-
isted, making the support group un-
necessary.

Senior representative Baltzer Le-
Jeune, said he could not support the
proposal because it was too loosely
defined. He recommended that Dr.
Worth work with concerned students
and EC members to write some
guidelines for the group. Included in
the guidelines would be the respon-
sibilities of the peer counselors, as
well as the specific role that Dr.
Worth would play.

EC President Shayam Menon said
he thought Worth’s intentions in
starting the group were good. But he
was unable to support the idea as it
was set forth for several reasons.

First, when a person is charged
with an honor violation, he is given a
list of people to contact for legal ad-
vice. According to Menon, the people
on this list are both the most qualified
and the most experienced in honor
defenses. Therefore, he did not
understand why the accused would
need a member of the support group
for technical advice.

Menon stressed the merits of the
existing support system, noting that
dorm counselors, friends, university
psychologists, and legal advisors all
‘were available for emotional-sup-—
‘port.

In other EC action:

The committee approved part of a
proposal to be submitted to the facul-
ty in their October meeting which
suggests changes in several student
committees. Submitted by the mem-
bers of the University Council, the
motion called for changes not only in
that committee, but also in the Stu-
dent Conduct Committee and the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee.

One part of the proposal said the
University Council should be dissolv-
ed next September, 1987. The UC’s
duties would be handled by the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee. This was
passed by the EC.

Another part suggested that the
composition of SAC be changed to in-
clude the president of the student
body, the president of the Student
Bar Association and three elected
representatives from the student
body. The chairman of the SCC and
the president of the Interfraternity
Council would therefore become non-
voting members of SAC. This would
be a change from the current com-
position of SAC, which is the presi-
dent of the student body, the presi-
dent of the Student Bar Association,
the chairman of the Student Conduct
Committee, the president of the In-
terfraternity Council, and the head
dormitory counselor. This part was
not adopted because the current
system is more representative, and it

wpe hea, fair if changed, the.

* committee said.

Each are between forty-five and six-
ty minutes in length. Each produc-
tion has an underlying theme, which,
coupled with brief dialogue, ties the
songs together. The group’s uni-
queness is that each member is in-
volved in the creative process. Ideas
are gathered from the group and are
organized into a skeleton script. This
script is then used to catalize im-
provisation at rehearsals. It is this
improvisation that results in the pro-
duction numbers.

David Nave, a 1986 graduate of
Washington and Lee, has _ been
elected to serve as the first year law
representative to the Executive Com-
mittee. Nave said that he has greatly
benefited from the Honor System
during his years a Welo—and-he
would like to put something back into
the system so that others might bene-
fit from it as well.

Anative of Oak Ridge, Tenn., Nave
was very active during his
undergraduate years. He was a
member of Sigma Phi Epsilon frater-
nity and played on the varsity men’s
tennis team. In addition to writing for
the Ring-tum Phi, Nave also worked
in the Reeves Center, where he was
responsible for organizing artistic
displays in the University Library.

As a result of his work in the
Reeves Center, Nave was given the
oppurtunity to work with a world
renowned collection of Chinese
porcelain, which dates back to the
seventeenth century. As a result, he
became interested in ceramic art,
and wrote a paper about the ceramic
art forms in Hogarth’s prints, an
original area of study.

When asked why he chose to return
to W&L for three additional years of
school, Nave cited several reasons.
First and foremost, Nave stressed

Vocal direction for the student-run
group is handled by junior Craig
Smith. Choreography and publicity
are handled by sophomore Elisabeth
Fowler. Other members of the group
are Christie Davis and Michelle
Brockman, sopranos; Susan Crouse
and Monica Burke, altos; Craig
Smith and Kevin Struthers, tenors;
Louis Cela, baritone; Steve Doran,
bass; and Pierson, accompanist.
Albert C. Gordon, head of the fine
arts department at W&L, serves as
faculty adviser.

the good reputation associated with
W&L, as well as the small, close-knit
community in which it is located.
Also important to him is the manner
in which classes are conducted: pro-
fessors are not only accessible, but
they encourage discussion in and out
of the classroom between student and
teacher.

Additionally, Nave liked the size of

Lexington, saying, “lf you have to:

live in a large city, then the possibili-
ty of problems is greater.’

Finally, Nave emphasized the at-
mosphere of trust at W&L that is
made possible by the Honor System.
He decided to run for the EC due to
his appreciation and respect of the
Honor System. He felt qualified
because of his familiarity with the
Honor System, and his desire to
represent his class on the committee.

“The Honor System deserves some
sort of commitment,’ he said.
Because he is committed to the ideals
of the Honor System, he feels he can
represent his class well.

When asked what his views were on
the use of fake identification cards,
Nave said, ‘‘I don’t see how it can be
construed in any other way than ly-
ing.” He feels it would be hypo-
critical to profess to believe in the
Honor System, while at the same
time condoning the use of something
that is a direct misrepresentation of
oneself. He also repeated the EC’s
policy of taking each case on its own

merit.

As a former staff reporter of the
Ring-tum Phi, Nave was aware of the
past controversy surrounding what
may be printed in the newspaper con-
cerning open honor trials. Since only
members of the W&L community are

. permitted to attend open honor trials,

Nave feels that reporting the facts in
the newspaper would open the Honor
System to scrutiny of individuals who
should not be concerned with it.

“The system is ours. It is our con-
cern. We don’t ask anyone to ad-
minister it for us,” he explained.
Simultaneously, Nave recognized
that one of the purposes of the school
newspaper is to provide a forum to
breed student opinion. He said ‘‘for
the Honor System to be a success,
you must have continual student
debate.’’ His general feelings,
however, are that it would be ideal to
stir up student opinion without in-
volving those who are non- members
of the W&L community.

As for changes he would like to see
made this year, Nave commented
that he first needs to familiarize
himself with all the aspects of the
EC, including the various powers and
responsiblities it possesses. At that
point, he will be able to have a better
idea of how to best represent the
members of his class and to advocate
any desirable changes.

ry concert, coed comedy highlight ’86 Homecoming

ABC bans beer

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Entertainment Editor

 

It looks like it’s going to be Coke
and Sprite for tomorrow night’s
General Public concert.

According to Student Activities
Board Chairman Glyn Alexander,
the SAB will not be selling beer at
Friday night’s Student Activities
Pavilion concert as it was not able to
obtain a beer license from the
Alcoholic Beverage Control Board.

“This is not necessarily the policy
for the whole year,” Alexander said.
“It is just for this show.”’

He said that the dispute over the
license hinged on the definition of a
“closed party featuring the Wash-
ington and Lee community.” The
ABC was willing to grant the SAB a
license provided the concert be at-
tended only by W&L students, their
dates and a handful of invited guests.
This constituted the ABC’s definition
of “the W&L community,” Alex-
ander said.

‘We all consider the girls’ schools
as part of the- W&L community,”
Alexander explained. ‘‘According to
the ABC ruling, carloads of girls
would no longer be considered in-
vited guests.”

He emphasized that it did not mat-
ter, according to ABC policy, that the
SAB was selling tickets to the event.

“In order to get a beer license, it
simply had to be a closed party
featuring the W&L community,” he

said. “We couldn’t come to terms this
time about that.”

Cokes and Sprite will be available
at the concert and will be sold by the
SAB. No coolers will be admitted,
however.

He also said that nobody who
seems to be “‘blatantly drunk”’ will be
admitted. A valid college I.D. will be
required.

Alexander was aware that alcohol
will probably be snuck in and he an-
nounced that the SAB will confiscate
any flasks they see.

“Someone with a flask will not
necessarily be thrown out,’’ Alex-
ander explained. ‘‘We’ll just take the
flask.”

On the other hand, he said that
anyone seen to be causing a great
deal of trouble will be asked to leave.

He said tickets are selling about as
well as expected, despite the new rul-
ing. Pre-concert ticket sales, how-
ever, are usually not a very good in-
dicator of eventual attendance.

“Not many people buy their tickets
in advance. They usually buy them at
the door. Last year’s R.E.M. concert
was an exception,’’ he said.

Alexander thought that this beer
restriction will, in the end, probably
affect attendance at tomorrow
night’s concert.

“It may affect this one, sure: but
as time goes on, people will have to
accept the fact that, at some events,
there will simply be no alcohol,” he
said.

 

 
OPINION

The Ring-tum Phi, October 16, 1986

General hospital

It happens every year. You catch a cold or wake up with a
sore throat and have to make that dreaded trip to the Student
Health Center, otherwise known as the Infirmary. You walk
in and there are about a dozen people in front of you. It’s
doubtful that you will be able to make it to your next class on
time. You mutter to yourself, ‘‘Surely there must be a better
way.”

Several complaints about the Infirmary have been heard
along the Colonnade. First, the lines are long. The waiting
area is not very suited for privacy. Often it’s possible to hear
the doctor-patient conversation all the way out in the waiting
area. If you want to ask the nurse a question, you have to ask
it in front of everyone who is waiting. Many times there isn’t
enough seating space, and it seems likely that a person could

97 up a worse illness than the one they came to see the doc-
tor for.

Secondly, the Health Center is often accused of handing out
drugs or prescriptions without really taking the time to find
out what’s wrong with the patient. Several students I know
went to the Infirmary repeatedly for a certain illness. Each
time the students received a new bottle of pills or syrup and
the advice, “‘Let’s try this and see how it works.” This ap-
proach to curing a medical problem seems haphazard, and
chances for success seem slim.

A related complaint is that the doctor makes a very brief
examination (averaging six minutes), and then hands the
student a prescription to “‘try.”” Again, the cause is too many
patients. If 20 or so students are waiting and the doctor is in
for only an hour and a half or two hours the examination for
each student is short.

As our Infirmary operates now, Dr. Feddeman comes in
each morning for about two hours to see patients, and Dr.
Pickral is there for an hour and a half each afternoon. This
system allows both doctors to have private practices in town,
and it also allows the students to get another opinion without
having to go outside the Infirmary services. If students are
dissatisfied with the diagnosis they received from one of the
doctors, or just seem to have a personality conflict with a
particular doctor, they are free to go to the other doctor for
further care.

The problem with the present arrangement is that since the
doctor is only here for a short time, everyone must see him at
that time, and long lines are the result.

I talked with both Dr. Feddeman and Dr. Pickral. I wanted
to find out their response to these complaints.

Both said they have noticed an increase in patients coming
to the Health Center since the University started admitting
women. The reason appears not to be that women get sicker
more easily than men, but that often women are more health-
conscious and less willing just to “suffer through” a cold. Dr.
Feddeman said the majority of the illnesses (affecting ap-
proximately 80% of all those who come to the Infirmary) are
upper-respiratory infections (colds) or gastro-intestinal ill-
ness (stomach flu or upset stomach).

The move to coeducation has prompted the Student Health
Center to offer some new services, namely pelvic exams and
prescriptions for birth control or fittings for diaphrams
(sorry guys, you still have to go to the drugstore). Dr. Fed-
deman, who is retiring at the end of this year, also says that
the University hopes to hire a woman physician by next fall
ood = students who may feel uncomfortable with a male

octor.

Dr. Feddeman expressed some concern over the growing
number of patients coming into the Infirmary, and the
limited number of beds available. Certainly, it seems, as
more women arrive on campus, the Student Health Center
will get busier and busier. Surely the University will have to
expand the hours in which a doctor is available or hire a full-
time physician and expand the Health Center’s facilities.

All things considered, the Health Center does the best it
can. It is humanly possible to see only so many students in an
hour and a half to two hour period. The Center is open 24
hours a day, although you might have to wait to be cared for
if the nurse is in the infirmary side taking care of those
restricted to their beds. Sometimes the bedside manner is not
the best in the world, but then again we are supposed to be
adults now who don’t need to be babied every time we get the
sniffles (the service-with-a-smile guarantee is only at
McDonald’s).

Perhaps subsequent changes in the staff will alleviate
some of the complaints of long lines and short examinations.
Perhaps if the doctors have more time to spend with each pa-
tient, they could make more accurate diagnoses and subse-
quent prescriptions, instead of seemingly giving every
medicine a “try” until one finally works. Until that time,
however, the student body will just have to muddle through
on Dimetapp and cough drops.

Student has loyalty to W&L

 

MY VIEW
By Jennifer Spreng

 

I can’t even begin to tell you how
ready for Homecoming I am.

I’m excited for the party, but that

isn’t really why I can hardly wait for
the big weekend.

General Public ought to be good

too, but I’d still be excited even if
they weren’t coming.

The real reason I’m so ready is the
football game. I intend to watch
every second of that ball game. I
know we're going to beat Hampden-
Sydney. We simply have to.

You see, I grew up in Hampden-
Sydney. If someone was writing my
biography, he’d say I spent my for-
mative years there,

I’ve always loved Hampden-Syd-
ney. I have enough memories of that
place to last a lifetime, that’s for
sure. I even have a sweatshirt, which
I have daringly worn around the
campus here. (The freshmen don’t
seem to care, but I get some of the
most interesting looks from the up-
perclassmen. )

Ahbh!! My confused loyalties!

At least, I thought my loyalties
-were confused.
I road tripped to H-SC this past
weekend. It was great to see my

friends again, but I was glad to get
back to W&L.

In five weeks, W&L has inspired as
much affection in me as Hampden-
Sydney did in four years.

Washington and Lee is not, and will
never be, just a school where you
spend four years of your life. W&L is
not a place to live, but a way of life.

I like this way of life.

It’s an intangible element that sets
W&L apart from so many schools
about which I’ve seen and heard.
Bound up in the attitudes of the peo-
ple, the honor system and the rela-
tionship we have with the town, there
is a challenge worth meeting. Only in
meeting this challenge can we really
ee ee eee &
er.

Some of my friends from the big
Northeastern cities say that it’s a
challenge to live for four years in a
small Virginia town. If they feel that
way, they were lucky that they chose
Lexington.

With so many services provided
through the community, like the post
office and religious opportunities, we
become part of a bigger community
here than just the college. It has in-
stilled in me a sense of responsibility
to this place, and I don’t think that
I’m the only one.

A student has to have a lot of

responsibility to survive W&L. Be-
tween renting a telephone and then
receiving the shock of the first bill, I
know that I have a lot to learn!

Even though mommy isn’t here to
forbid them, eventually I am going to
cut back on my long distance calls. It
may have been expensive, but it
meant a lot to learn that lesson on my
own.

Maybe that’s the biggest adjust-
ment that a freshman has to make—
learning how to take care of oneself
by setting priorities.

W&L is a good place to develop
those abilities. From handling a
telephone to respecting the honor
system, this place is molding in-
dividuals (as the old saying goes)
who will work hard, play hard
and...well, never mind.

You know what I mean.

W&L is creating gentlepeople. My
class of 1990, like the many classes
before us, and undoubtedly like the
many classes to come, will be a
group of well-rounded, responsible
adults. That’s because we will have
lived that life for four years.

Sound like a strange reason to be
looking forward to the Generals
whipping the Tigers on Saturday? It
isn’t really. W&L is my home, my
loyalties are invested here, and I’m
ready to be proud of it.

 

Honor?

MY VIEW
By Mark Farley

 

 

When Robert E. Lee was president
of Washington College, a new student
approached him, asking him about
the rules of the college. President
Lee is supposed to have replied that
there were no written or codified
rules. It was only expected that a stu-
dent conduct himself as a gentlemar
at all times. '

T’ll just pause here for a momey’
and allow that to sink in.

An English professor at Washing-
ton and Lee is fond of saying that tie
past is like another country: things
are done differently there. Indeed,
this is quite true. One hundred 0:
even 50 years ago, if you made ar
rangements to meet with someone,
he was there at the expected hour:
Now, you find yourself having to wait
20 or more minutes for the person to
arrive, if he arrives at all. The next
day, if you are lucky, the person
might shout to you across the Colon-
nade about how he had to get lunch
and catch ‘‘All My Children,”’ when
he was suppposed to be meeting with
you. He ends his yelling by promising
that he will try to catch up with you
later. And so, you continue on, not
knowing whether he means it.

In the past, giving your word
meant something. Now, I am not so
sure. The principal difference is that
honor used to encompass the concept
of acting like a gentleman or lady.
Now, with the tunnel vision of the
1980s, we see honor as including only
three facets: not lying, not cheating,
and not stealing. If we avoid these
three, we feel that our conscience is
clear, regardless of the actual nature
of our behavior and actions.

All too often, we are gentlemen and
ladies of convenience. In other
words, we are gentlemen and ladies
when it pleases or benefits us. When
we want to cash an out-of-state
check, get something on credit, or
have our word taken as the truth, we'
point proudly to President Lee’s
words and the Honor System and
then flash the clerk a bright and
reassuring smile. But when we want
to relax, kick back with our friends
and drink some beer, the concept of
gentlemanly conduct is hung up and
put away as if it were some cumber-
some and antiquated costume that no
longer fits.

Every week, this newspaper is full
of examples: obscenities and beer
are tossed at policemen as well as at
other students, individuals are ver-
bally abused, walls in fraternity
houses and dorms are punched and
kicked in and countless panes of
glass are shattered. All this is in the
name of fun and relaxation. Each
year, vandalism costs us, the
Washington and Lee community,
thousands of dollars. Yes, even at
W&L the concept of weekday gentle-
men is alive and well.

Let us not be so foolish as to think
that our disrespect for property is on-'
ly alcohol induced. The music depart-
ment has had recurrent problems
with pianos being vandalized. Disket-
tes and templates for Word Perfect
and Lotus programs disappear from
the stands by the computers. If these
are examples are not convincing
enough, you only have to take a look
around campus and read the writing
on the walls, as it were. One must
certainly wonder what sort of
gentleman plans his social ‘“en-
counters” on the bathroom stalls.

Although there is a concept of
honor at Washington and Lee, one
must wonder how clear a perception
we have of it. I once saw it written
that “‘Honor should be restored to
W&L!”’ Of course, this ‘‘noble’’
assertion was tainted by the fact that
it was deeply gouged on the library's
elevator door.

Reykjavik and lost opportunities: Is SDI worth it?

 

MY VIEW
By Paul J. Smith

 

As we sit back and try to figure out
what went wrong in Reykjavik,
Iceland, we can be assured of one
thing: SDI (Strategic Defense In-
itiative) has assumed a new rank and
role in U.S.-Soviet relations, Never
before have arms control discussions
rested so clearly on one issue.

For the sake of SDI and its deploy-
ment, the United States has missed
an unprecedented opportunity to cut
in half the number of ICBM’s within
the next 10 years, and to reduce the
number of intermediate-range
weapons to zero.

Why did we give up this opportuni-
ty?

The price would have been keeping
SDI confined to the laboratory, which
Reagan claims would have killed the
SDI program altogether. Because of
the secrecy surrounding the SDI pro-
gram, it is impossible to argue
beyond an educated guess whether
this is true or not. But one thing is

clear; SDI has emerged as the major
barrier to improved U.S.-Soviet rela-
tions, and as such should be scrutiniz-
ed by every tax-paying American for
the cost involved in such a Herculean
program. The question thus be-
comes, “Is SDI worth the costs: not
only the costs of missed opportunities
in Iceland, but also the larger
economic costs associated with the
mammoth budgetary needs of SDI?”

According to defense department
statistics, a total of $27 billion has
been allocated for the five-year
period beginning with 1985. If SDI is
implemented to its fullest extent,
however, the cost could run as high
as $1 trillion for a technologically ex-
otic multitiered system including
necessary management and com-
munication facilities. While sup-
porters of SDI argue that such an ex-
penditure would be spread out over
many years, the price is staggering,
nevertheless.

The second question that must be
addressed concerns the role of SDI.
Initially SDI was a government
research effort designed to examine
advanced technologies to build an ef-
fective defense against ballistic
missiles. Up until now, the goal of
this research has simply been to

determine the feasibility of such a
program. Supporters and critics of
SDI research have seen the program
as a bargaining chip to receive
serious concessions from the Soviets.

The reasoning goes like this: if we
conduct research in SDI, the Soviets
will be more willing to talk, and offer
more substantial cuts in their offen-

sive nuclear arsenal.
And in fact it has worked. In
Geneva. In Iceland. In both

meetings, the fact that SDI was a ma-
jor concern to the Soviets was evi-
dent in the proposals put forth by the
Soviets. This was true in Iceland
especially, where the Soviets were
willing to compromise not only in the
area of arms-reductions, but also in
the area of human rights.

So why doesn’t the United States
take advantage of this? After all it
does not seem logical to spend $27
billion on SDI research without reap-
ing some tangible benefits, such as
reduction in the number of ICFM’s or
Intermediate Range Missiles on both
sides — unless SDI is to be upgraded
into the deployment stage, in which
case we've got a whole new ball-
game.

If this becomes the case, then the
United States must seriously scru-

tinize SDI for what it is, and what 1
will be. Those factors that should be
considered include: costs, potential
Soviet response (such as stockpiling
of offensive weapons, or building a
‘Soviet SDI), efficacy of SDI, impact
‘on strategic parity.

There is not much time. The United
States and Soviet Union are at the
threshold of a new era in East-West
relations. We can choose to use SDI
as it was originally intended-to serve
as a bargaining tool with which the
U.S. could effectively work with the
Soviet Union in bringing about a
meaningful arms-control agreement
and an environment within which
cultural and social exchange could
take place.

Our other alternative is to
unilaterally embark on the most ex-
pensive, resource-exhausting and
complex projects ever attempted in
the history of humankind, thus in-
itiating a whole new kind of arms
race, the ramifications of which will
be felt far and wide, in every corner
of the globe—economically, political-
ly, militarily. This will be the Pan-
dora’s box to top all Pandora’s boxes.
And then when we finally realize
what we’ve done, it will be too late.

BV men arrested

 

By PETER BOATNER
Staff Reporter

 

Six Washington and Lee students
were the victims of burglary in the
past week, and Lexington police ar-
rested two Buena Vista men in con-
nection with three of the charges,
Lexington City Police reports said.

The suspect was apprehended by
police at about 2:30 a.m. on Sunday,
police reports said, after being sur-
rounded by several W&L students in-
cluding Michael Carroll, who said he
found the suspect in his room at the
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity
house.

Jeffrey D. Anderson, 19, of 733 E.
24th St. and Tony T. Dudley, 21, of
1406 Maple Lane, both of Buena
Vista, were charged with burglary

West Washington Street will be
reopened for through traffic by Oct.
30, according to Billy Walker, con-
struction supervisor for the J. M.
Turner Co.

The street was closed from Warner
Center to the Gaines Residence Hall
construction site on Nelson Street so
that underground steam lines could
be laid to the new dormitory. Con-
struction on the dormitory began last
spring.

In addition to traffic problems, the
construction project has caused
other inconveniences as well. Noise
is a particular nuisance to nearby
residents and students. Work begins
each day at 7 a.m. with the accompa-
nying sounds of bulldozers and
jackhammers.

D.J. Hatfield, a sophomore resi-
dent of the International House at 2
West Washington St., said he is never
able to sleep later than 6:30 or 7 a.m.
He also said that workers place their
lunchboxes on the porch and use his
hammock without permission.

The residents of the International
House did, however, reap one benefit
from the construction — it gave them
a theme for their “Hole in the Front
Yard” party.

and grand larceny.

Earlier in the week two other SAE
members, Hugh White and Clement
Klank, had noticed items missing
from their rooms at the house, which
they reported to the police following
the incident involving Carroll.

White reported $250 worth of
cassette tapes and a $15 tape carry-
ing case missing, and Klank reported
$105 worth of tapes, $60 worth of ties,
$20 worth of cologne, a $30 racquet-
ball racquet and a duffle bag gone
from his room, police records said.

Following police investigation of
these new charges, Anderson was ar-
rested a second time early on the
morning of Oct. 13. He was charged
with burglary and a grand larceny in
these two cases.

Anderson is currently on probation

Washington Street remains closed.

Guest House on West Washington
Street, has also been affected by the
construction. Although her weekend
spaces are booked, she said, tourists
no longer carry the weeknight busi-
ness. She also said she has been
bothered by dust from the construc-
tion site blowing into her house.

Walker said he would talk to the
workers about using the Interna-
tional House porch. He also said that
the site is watered down each even-
ing to minimize the amount of dust.
Because of the work schedule, the
noise cannot be reduced, he said,

Other victims of theft were John K.

Moore, who reported his $200 Jensen
car stereo speakers taken from his,
1980 Honda sometime on Oct. 11 or 12.
He had left the car at 201 E. Washing-
ton St., police reports said.

Michael Tuggle reported $300

his car sometime on Oct. 8 or 9. The
car was parked behind 201 E. Wash-

The construction project on
Washington Street was originally
scheduled to be completed by Sept.
30. Walker explained that the site’s
uneven grade and clay-like soil were
to blame for the delay.

Frank A. Parsons, executive assis-
tant to the president, is not worried
about the delay. Parsons, who has
been involved in the design of the new
dormitory, said the Turner Co. pro-
jected that the construction on
Washington Street could be com-
pleted sooner than was actually
possible. According to Parsons, it is »

LEXICON

   

 

Lexicon is a sometimes humorous,
usually opinionated column about
issues, events and people of interest
to the Washington and Lee com-
munity.

 

 

This is Spot. This is Steve. See Steve

See ankle do no-no.

No run, Steve, no run.

“The Steve and Spot Story,” 1986

Hobbling around Lexington the
past few weeks has been a pain in
more than just the ankle.

First came the questions:

“So did you fall off a barstool?”’

“Did the guys on your hall beat
you up?”

“Were you fending off freshmen
females as they ferociously ripped
at your clothes?”

Then came the answer:

“Unfortunately, no. I was just
running down a hill in a cross
country time trial and sprained
my ankle.”’

People stared at my foot and
asked how long it would be until it
fell off. There was talk of my pos-
ing with Ham Smith as the jour-
nalism department’s poster child.

W&L Athletic Trainer Tom

 

“Bulldog”? Jones termed my in-
jury a “classic sprain,”’ but unlike
Coca-Cola, “classic”’ is not always
better in the wonderful world of
the walking wounded. I worried
that Coach Jones would mount my
ankle and display it for his ‘‘tapes
and scrapes’ class. I worried
even more when his assistants at-
tached muscle-stimulation elec-
trodes to my foot and submerged
it in a tub of icewater. I’d heard of
borscht, but this cold feet soup
stuff was ridiculous.

Actually, I owe the trainers a
thank-you for a fairly speedy
recovery. Any people willing to
put up with my stinking feet and
stupid jokes twice a day are all
right in my book, even if I’m not
all right in theirs.

It’s easy to notice the problem
when we see someone temporarily
on crutches. But we in the W&L
community must realize the
obstacles faced by those who are

wheelchair-bound or have perma-
nent difficulty walking. Most of
the elevators on campus — and
there aren’t many — need keys.
Our Colonnade is very beautiful,
but those old buildings, with their
steps and steep stairways, hardly
make the handicapped feel
capable.

To solve this problem, campus
leaders should consider adding
more access ramps. We should
replace some of our heavy, swing-
back-in-your-face doors with ones
that meet the needs of the disabl-
ed. Our community leaders must
make it easier to get around the
city.

As W&L continues its transition
into the 20th century, the needs of
the handicapped must be con-
sidered, After all, about the only
real benefit of hobbling around
Lexington is that it’s a good topic
for a human-interest column.

And now even that’s old news.

“not uncommon to run'ifto delays.”

 

Washington and Lee University and the local Red
Cross held their fall blood drive Wednesday from 11:00
to 5:00. Chris Martin of Chi Psi and Jon Solomon of
Sigma Nu helped to organize the drive.

Kegs were given to the organizations with the most
members and the highest percentage of participating
members. Chi Psi members worked at the drive and
Sigma Nu members distributed posters and signed up
the donors.

Rockbridge County is experiencing a shortage of
blood, and all types are needed. The goal this year was
150 pints, with each person usually donating a pint. At
noon, Head Nurse Norma Hancock, said that they were
not experiencing many problems, but the drive was
much slower than last year. Many workers at the drive
commented on the poor turnout. The goal was not
reached, for only 129 pints were donated.

The top five contributing fraternities were Chi Psi,
Fiji, Phi Delta Theta, Sigma Chi, and Sigma Nu. Facul-
ty members, independents and various other school
organizations were also represented. ROTC won the
keg for the most participants, and Phi Delta Theta won
for the highest percentage with 27% of their members
donating blood.

WaA&L receives grant

Washington and Lee University has received a grant
of $50,000 from the Jessie Ball duPont Religious,
Charitable and Educational Fund of Jacksonville, Fla.
The grant will be used for the purchase of equipment for
the University’s science departments.

The duPont Fund was established in duPont’s will
and is designed for the philanthropic support of
religious, charitable and educational activities, notably
in higher education.

A native of Northumberland County, duPont was
awarded an honorary degree from W&L in 1947 in
recognition of her support of higher education and her
benefactions to the University. She was a trustee of
W&L from 1959 until her death in 1970. The duPont
Scholarship Program, the duPont Professorship in
Religion, and duPont Hall, the University’s fine arts
building, are named in Mrs. duPont’s honor.

Dedication to be Saturday

The Chavis House at 10 Lee Ave., one of Washington
and Lee University’s residences for upperclass
students and cultural center for the Minority Student
Association, will be dedicated on Saturday at 4 p.m.

The house was named after John Chavis, the first
black to attend W&L, by the Board of Trustees at its
meeting last February.

Chavis, a widely respected teacher and minister in
the Presbyterian Church, attended Liberty Hall
Academy (now Washington and Lee) in 1795 after
studying at Princeton College. He later moved to North
Carolina where he opened several schools and con-
tinued preaching and writing until his death in 1838.

The first floor of the Chavis House, which serves as
the cultural center, is open to members of the Minority
Student Association and their guests and is furnished

SPE tangled in cable splitting

 

By PETER BOATNER
Staff Reporter

The Sigma Phi Epsilon house is in
hot water with Lexington Cable Com-
pany, but all parties involved think
the situation will be easily resolved.

According to Gary Judy, manager
of the cable company, SPE has con-
tracted for cable service to one
television set at the house on Preston
Street.

On a routine service check last

week, however, he found splitters
had been installed to divide the signal
for service to 12 televison sets.

Judy sent a registered letter to the
house, asking the members either to
disconnect the splitters or start pay-
ing for 12 sets.

SPE President Russell Whitman
said he doesn’t know when the split-
ters were installed, but that they
have now been disconnected.

“I went through and disconnected
them to the best of my ability, but I

asked them (Lexington Cable) to
come out and check’’ to make sure
they’re all gone, he said.

“We don’t press charges on the
first offense,”’ said Judy. ‘‘We’re go-
ing to wait and see how they handle
this.”

Whitman said the splitters were in
place at the beginning of this year, to
the best of his knowledge. Members
who had sets attached to the cable
were told either to begin paying for
the service or to make sure their
television is disconnected.

IFC awards ZBT for highest GPA

The Interfraternity Council award-
ed a plaque and $500 to the Zeta Beta
Tau fraternity at its meeting last
Tuesday night.

The IFC awarded ZBT for having
the highest fraternity grade point
average for the fall and winter terms
last year, IFC President Chris Sax-
man said. A Plaque will be presented
to ZBP atthe: Homecoming football
game this Saturday.” The check for

$500 will be donated to the United
Way in the name of ZBT.

The IFC is organizing a canned
food drive for the upcoming
Thanksgiving holidays. Working
through the fraternities, canned food
is to be bought and donated for
distribution to needy families in the
Lexington area.

This year’s rush statistics are still
being compiled, Saxman said. The
final numbers will be released after
this weekend’s tears are added, he

said. Current figures show that ap-
proximately seventy percent of
freshman males have joined houses,
he added.

The IFC urged fraternity represen-
tatives to notify freshmen and other
fraternity members of an alcohol

place this Wednesday.

The discussion, ‘The Law and

While the new grass grows, it’s on-
ly a matter of time before the new
practice/playing fields located al
Liberty Hall will be ready for full:

Approved by the Board of Trustees
in the spring of 1985, the new fields
are scheduled to be completed by the
beginning of the 1987 fall athletic
season. Washington and Lee athletics
will no longer have a shortage of
practice space.

“This has been over many years in
the process,”’ said Associate Director
of Athletics Dick Miller. “We have
always been short of playing fields.”

Miller said that when he arrived in
1952, the only fields available were
Wilson Field, Smith Field, and a
small practice field that is called

of the irrigation water line is $50,000

tual irrigation of the field account for
the remaining cost. The parking area
that was recently constructed was
not included in the field budget and
was funded by other means.

sent fields are the poor drainage

Soccer storms VMI
for 6th straight win

 

By GARY MeCULLOU!
Staff Reporter

A General’s invasion occurred
yesterday at VMI.

The Washington and Lee men’s
soccer team stormed the VMI cam-
pus yesterday and retreated only
after defeating the Keydets by a 2-1
score, Coupled with it’s 2-1 defeat of
Messiah College last Saturday, the
VMI win knocked the General’s
season record up to 7-3.

Both goals in the VMI game were
scored by senior captain Peter Van
Son. His scoring show was backed by
an outstanding team effort which
held the Keydets to only one goal.

After the game, W&L head coach
Rolf Piranian said, “The different
problems we’ve had, we’ve adressed.
I think the team is steadily improv-
ing. The defense is allowing a
minimal number of goals, and the of-
fense is progressing as usual.”

Last weekend’s win over the very
successful Messiah team was also

exciting for the Generals. It was the
team’s fifth straight win, and a very
successful season seems to be just
over the horizon. Junior Chuck Lyle
and sophomore Mike Veliouna scored
goals for the Generals.

Freshman Rick Silva commented
on the defense: ‘There are still some
problems, but, for the most part,
we've corrected them to where they
don’t affect us as much anymore.”
Silva continued, ‘‘We just changed
our style, Our forwards are also play-
ing better defense which makes
things go a lot smoother.”

Silva said that things were going
much better between the backfield
and the midfield, so the offense has
much more opportunity to score.

Now that the team is 7-3, momen-
tum is at an obvious peak. With the
defensive improvement and the of-
fensive aggressiveness, the Generals

should be well equipped for the Senior captain Peter Van Son (4) gives chase to a VMI Keydet in yester-

Scots edge Generals; FB still seeking first win

By JIM LARE
Staff Reporter

Last year at this time the Generals
were in the midst of a six game win-

ning streak that nearly put them into
the NCAA Division ITI playoffs. What
a difference a year makes.

Washington and Lee recorded its
fourth loss in as many games last
Saturday, falling to Maryville Col-
lege by a score of 35-28.

Maryville started the scoring just
four minutes into the game with an
18-yard run by freshman Julio Kilid-
djian, but the Generals quickly
responded with a 26-yard touchdown
pass from Jon Thornton
to wide-out Bobby Wilson. Washing-
ton and Lee scored the only touch-
down of the second quarter on a 77-

yard pass from Thornton to wide-out
Randy Brown, giving the Generals a
14-7 lead at halftime.

Generals head coach Gary Fallon,
remembering last week’s loss to
Randolph-Macon, reminded his
players that ‘‘we have to play a full 60

Ininutes and try to win both halves.”

W&L led or was tied with the Yellow
Jackets for 59:59 last week but lost in
the final second of the game on a ball
batted in the end zone.

But instead of extending the lead,
the Generals turned the ball over ona
fumble by Thornton in their first
possession of the half, and
quickly drove to the W&L 7-yard line.
On first down and goal, the Scots
were assessed a holding penalty, but
on second and seventeen, Maryville’s
junior QB Mike Human hit wide-out
Chris Johannsen to tie the score at 14

Less than three minutes later,
W&L tailback Kevin Weaver scored
his 26th career touchdown on a 13-
yard carry, but the rest of the period
was all downhill for the Generals. On
a subsequent third-down play deep in
Scot territory, Human found wide-out
Bob Echols for a 60-yard gain, and
the ck scored
seconds later on a 4-yard run.

Just seconds later, Thornton was
intercepted by linebacker Jason Har-
bison, and, two plays after that,
Johannsen caught his second touch-
down pass of the day. The score gave
the Scots their first lead, 28-21, and
gave Human seven consecutive com-
pletions for 168 yards and two

touchdowns.

Four minutes into the fourth
quarter, Thornton was intercepted
by cornerback Tyan Shelton, who
returned the pass 38 yards for a
touchdown, the second score given up
by the W&L offense in as many
games. Less than three minutes
later, Weaver pulled the Generals to
within seven on a 39-yard dash with
8:20 . But kicker Mark
Olovic’s PAT proved to be the final
point of the ball game, giving W&L a
35-28 loss and the Scots their first win
of the season.

“We are not a good enough football
team to come back from a 14 point
deficit late in the game,”’ said Fallon.
“We are obviously disappointed. We
had some opportunities to put the
game away, but we didn’t,”’

‘Mental’errors hurt polo

 

From Staff Reports

 

The Washington and Lee water
polo team won two of its four games
at the Northeast Varsity Invitational
last weekend.

Army beat the Generals, 10-8, and
Bucknell continued its dominance
over W&L, 16-9, in the first two
games of the tournament held at
Brown University.

“We made some mental mistakes
against some good teams, but came
back to play good mental polo to win
the last two games,” said head coach
Page Remillard.

Cross country:

In their next two games, the
Generals beat MIT, 15-7, and Ford-
ham, 12-7.

This weekend, the Generals host
the second round of the Southern
League Tournament at Cy Twombly
Pool.

In the first round of the tourna-
ment, the Generals placed second
behind the Richmond Spiders, who
are ranked among the nation’s top
twenty teams.

This weekend, in addition to Rich-
mond, the Generals will face George

By ELIZABETH PARKINS
Staff Reporter

The men’s cross country team im-
proved its record to four and two with
solid wins over American University
and Catholic University at their tri-
meet in Washington, D.C., this past
Saturday.

Led by junior Scott Rippeon who
placed first (26:11), junior Richard
Moore who placed second (26:16),
and senior Ash Andrews who placed
third (26:18), the team scored a low
25 points. American University was a
distant second with 43 points and
Catholic University finished with 58

points.

“We ran right together the whole
race,’ said Andrews, ‘‘but we also
had a lot of support from Joe Geitner

Casker, and Jim Busenleiner

“The fact that these freshmen did
do so well shows that we are coming
together as a team. We are now solid
— being five or six (men) deep,” add-
ed Andrews.

Head Coach Dick Miller was also
pleased with the team’s perfor-
mance. “When you get one, two,
three you can’t ask for much more.
We have probably run, as a team, the
best we’ve run all year,” said Miller.

While the men were in D.C., the
women traveled for the State meet

there was at least one impressive in-

stuck together,”’ said Williams.

New playing fields
will give more space

 

By MIKE SHADY
\ssistant Sports Editor

 

While the new grass grows, it’s on-
ly a matter of time before the new
practice/playing fields located at
Liberty Hall will be ready for full
time use

Approved by the Board of Trustees
in the spring of 1985, the new fields
are scheduled to be completed by the
beginning of the 1987 fall athletic
season. Washington and Lee athletics
will no longer have a shortage of
practice space.

‘This has been over many years in
the process,” said Associate Director
of Athletics Dick Miller. “We have
always been short of playing fields.”

Miller said that when he arrived in
1952, the only fields available were
Wilson Field, Smith Field, and a
small practice field that is called
Alumni Field. Since that time, the ad-
ministration has funded the construc-
tion of the New Alumni Field, the
upper-level tennis courts, and the
leveling of a hilly area near the

| baseball field. More progress,
however, was waiting in the wings.

“With the advent of women’s
athletics, we’ve been insisting for
some more fields,” said Miller. ‘‘It’s
a necessity for our teams. We've
wanted to get soccer off the baseball
field, and since W&L athletics as well
as the IM programs have expanded,
more playing fields have been in de-
mand,” he said.

The cost for the total project will
come to about $425,000, with the ma-
jor cost ($180,000) going toward the
actual leveling of the area. The cost
of the irrigation water line is $50,000
and $25,000 is for the fencing. Fine
grading, seeding the field, and the ac-
tual irrigation of the field account for
the remaining cost. The parking area
that was recently constructed was
not included in the field budget and
was funded by other means.

Two major problems with the pre-
sent fields are the poor drainage
system and the overuse. The dirt of
the two alumni fields is hard packed
because of poor drainage, thus pre-
venting complete grass coverage.

Because they are in such short sup-
ply, the fields are used almost year-
round. This again allows the sod little

compound problems, Miller said,
there is also too much clay mixed in
with the soil. The result is a field that
is difficult to water and that burns up
during the summer months.

won’t have that problem with the new
ones. They have an underground

drainage system. In fact, because of
this, they may be the best fields we
will have.”

The fields will be used, Miller said,
by whomever needs them, and use
will rotate from year to year and
from season to season.

The next step, said Miller, will be
the renovation of some, if not all, of
the present playing fields. This, how-
ever, may not happen for quite some
time.

“Hopefully, we will get to the point
where a field will be able to have a
rest so it can remain in good playing
shape,”’ he said.

Bucknell continued its dominance
over W&L, 16-9, in the first two

back to play good mental poio to win
the last two games,” said head coach
Page Remillard.

Cross country:

In their next two games, the
Generals beat MIT, 15-7, and Ford

The men’s cross country team im-
proved its record to four and two with
solid wins over American University
and Catholic University at their tri-
meet in Washington, D.C., this past
Saturday.

Led by junior Scott Rippeon who
placed first (26:11), junior Richard
Moore who placed second (26:16),
and senior Ash Andrews who placed
third (26:18), the team scored a low
25 points. American University was a
distant second with 43 points and
Catholic University finished with 58
points.

“We ran right together the whole
race,” said Andrews, “‘but we also
had a lot of support from Joe Geitner
(freshman), Rick Norris, Greg
Casker, and Jim Busenleiner

“The fact that these freshmen did
do so well shows that we are coming
together as a team. We are now solid
— being five or six (men) deep,” add
ed Andrews.

Head Coach Dick Miller was also
pleased with the team’s perfor-
mance. “When you get one, two

We have probably run, as a team, the
best we’ve run all year,” said Miller

While the men were in D.C., the
women traveled for the State meet
(Division II and III) at Lynchburg
College. Although they didn’t win.
there was at least one impressive in
dividual performance. Sophomore
Tracy Williams set a women’s schoo!
record of 24:12 in the 3K race.

Like the men’s team, the women
all finished near each other.

“We all came in within 1:30 of each
other and that was our goal. We all
stuck together,’’ said Williams.

General Public are

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Entertainment Editor

 

Let’s get one thing straight from
the outset: General Public is not the
English Beat. Nor are they the Fine
Young Cannibals. For that matter,
General Public is not Public Image
Ltd., either. Which reminds me that
Public Image Ltd. is not, incidental-
ly, the Sex Pistols. Public Image Ltd.
certainly isn’t the English Beat,
either.

Got that straight?

General Public, featuring former
English Beat leaders Dave Wakeling
and Ranking Roger, will roll into
town tomorrow night for a perfor-
mance at the Student Activities
Pavilion—that we can definitely get
straight. Tickets for the show are $8
and will be sold until showtime. The
opening act, the Buddy System, will
kick off festivities promptly at 9:15,
and General Public should hit the
stage around 10:30. That is almost
certain.

One thing that was certain about
the English Beat, however, was that
they certainly were good. Their three
albums — “Just Can’t Stop It,”
‘“‘Wha’ppen?”’ and ‘‘Special Beat Ser-
vice’ — were delicious pop/ska con-
coctions brimming with irresistible
rhythm, soul and exuberance. A Beat
song started at your toes, slid
through your abdomen, and crawled
into your brain. And nine times out of
10, that’s exactly where it stayed for
several days: bouncing around in
your head like an impatient dance
partner.

But it hath been said that all good
things come to an end, And according
to former Beat and current General
Public lead vocalist Dave Wakeling,
the Beat bit the dust for four distinct
reasons: ‘‘Exhaustion, greed, anger
and stupidity.”

So, on the verge of almost guaran-
teed American success, the mighty
English Beat disbanded. Wakeling
and fellow Beat singer/songwriter
Ranking Roger wasted no time,
however, and immediately began
forming General Public. A year of
writing and rehearsing produced an
exciting debut LP called ‘‘...All the
Rage” and General Public picked up,
in both sound and approach, exactly
where the Beat left off. An infectuous
Top 30 hit, ‘“Tenderness,’’ and a No. 1
year-end dance record, ‘‘Never You
Done That,” immediately establish-
ed General Public as an act to be
reckoned with.

Whereas the Beat, however, waxed
political on frequent occasion (their
notorious ‘Stand Down Margaret”
was a sinister attack on Margaret
Thatcher’s dubious economic
policies of the early ’80’s, for exam-
ple), General Public tends to address
more general (no pun intended) and
less controversial topics.

“As the times get more conser-
vative, you feel that if you want to
make a point, then perhaps you have
to couch it in terms that will help it
get through,”’ Wakeling has said. ‘If
we're to bring out “Stand Down
Margaret” in England now, it would
never get played on the radio
anyway, so what’s the point?”

Mick Jones, current guiding force
for Big Audio Dynamite (who is not,
by the way, the Clash, but that’s a dif-
ferent story entirely) was rumored to
have joined General Public back in
the group’s embryonic stage, but on-
ly ended up appearing as a ‘‘guest
star’’ on ‘“‘... All The Rage.”

The guys have just unleashed their
second I.R.S. LP, ‘‘Hand To Mouth,”
as well as a catchy, hook-laden single
called ‘“‘Too Much Or Nothing.”’ The
album continues in the same vein as
‘All The Rage’’ with added pop

punch and a more secure sense of
identity.

Two new members have joined the
Public — Gianni and Mario Minardi.
The brothers were part of a ska/rock
band called the Basics, who opened
up for General Public last year. So
impressed were Dave and Roger that
they persuaded the Minardis into
“going public,” as it were.

“Hand to Mouth” was actually
completed in the summer of ’86, but

mixing was continually interrupted
by a series of childbirths. First Dave
and Roger became fathers, then pro-
ducer David Leonard (Prince, Ban-
gles), and lastly engineers John
Shawn and Sidney Burton. Whew!

“Something to do with fertile im-
aginations,”’ Wakeling said.

“Sorry if you’ve had to wait, but if
you’ve got a problem, take it up with
the babies, not us,” quipped Ranking
Roger.
