‘Candidates

receive no

majority

"By JOHN PENSEC

+

No candidate received a clear ma-
jority in Monday’s Big Three elec-
ion. Run-offs for the positions of Ex-
ecutive Committee president, vice
president and secretary were held to-
day, but returns were not available
when the paper went to press.

Brad Root and Brandt Wood faced
each other today, each hoping to be
elected president of the student body.
Root received 403 votes on Monday,
c<ompered with Woods 311 votes. The
other presidential candidate Rick
Robins received 148 votes, and write-
sn candidate Matt Upton received 2
yrotes. 65 votes did not cast a vot for
president.

t In the vice presidential race,
Christopher deMovellan and Pat
Schaefer made it into the run-offs,
Jefeating Norman Sigler and Mark
Davis in the process. deMovellan
ceceived 323 votes, Schaefer 295
votes. Sigler and Davis received 89
and 197 votes, respectively. There
were 25 non-voters for vice president.

And Valerie Pierson, the first coed
.o run for a Big Three office, made it

ato today’s run-off with 253 votes.
she faced Mark Chiappara who
-eceived 274. Tom O’Brien and Greg
Oale received 238 and 101 votes
espectively. There were 63 non-
‘oters for secretary.

Only 929 students voted in Mon-
jay’s election, roughly 50 percent of
hose eligible to vote. The Big Three
are the highest student government
»ositions at Washington and Lee.

“I can’t remember a time since I
save been involved in student body
“lections that the voter turnout has
been over 50 percent for Big Three
~lections,” said John Scannapieco,
vhairman of the Voting Regulations
Board. He said that the average is
between 45 and 50 percent.

Student |.D.s
not taken

By CHRISTIE CHAMPLIN
Staff Reporter

 

Recently there has been controver-
sy over what type of identification
students must show before being
allowed to purchase alcohol.

Last Wednesday, senior Thom
Randolph was not allowed to buy
alcohol in the GHQ because he could
prove his age only by showing his stu-
dent I.D. Randolph had not brought
his driver’s license so he was not
stamped as being of legal drinking

age.

RRandolph said that this had never
happened to him before. However, he
knew of ‘‘someone who went with his
student I.D. and had his hand
stamped as being old enough.’’ The
people who were working the door
said they could not accept just a stu-
dent I.D. They said they need a valid
driver’s license as proof of age.

“The ABC policy requires a valid
driver’s license as proof of age,”’ said

Glynn Alexander, chairman of the
Student Activities Board. ‘School
I.D.’s can be used as backup,” he ad-
ded. This driver’s license policy
“‘makes sure we can’t be held liable”
and prevents people who borrowed
I.D.’s from their friends from drink-
ing, noted Alexander. The people
working the door are not always sure
what other schools’ I.D.s look like.

Alexander said that the people
working the door that night probably
didn’t know Randolph. Alexander
said that if there is a question, ‘‘more
than likely if someone knows him he
will be let in.” He also said that
usually “if there is someone who I
have known for all four years and
have grown up with”’ he will be able
to drink. Alexander clarified the use
of the policy in both the pavilion and
the GHQ.

Dean Atkins said that the “law is
that the only acceptable ID for the
purposes of the ABC is a valid

Law editorial raises Honor System debate

By TOM BRICKEL
Staff Reporter

 

In 1984, the Washington and Lee
Student Bar Association presented a
referendum to law students asking
whether or not the law scnool should
establish its own judicial system to
enforce the Sehool’s Honor Code.
Three years latér, the question still
has not been answered.

In the February 19 Law News an
editorial entitled ‘“‘Does the E.C.
Uphold Fairness?” raised problems
with the White Book with regard to
the enforcement of the Honor Code,
as manifested in the Executive Com-
mittee. The provisions under ques-
tion in the editorial regard matters of
procedure which, according to the
editorial, ‘‘... may make a mockery of
the term justice unless they are
changed.”’

“By raising these particular
points, we hope to strengthen, not
weaken, the Honor Code,’’ said Don
Spratt, a third year law student and
editor-in-chief of the W&L Law News.
“The judicial code employed in the
current system in fact conflicts with
many of the things taught in law
school.

“The purpose of the editorial’s
criticism was to make the student
body’and the E.C. aware that pro-
blems do exist, and unless changed,
will possibly justify the creation of a
separate judicial system in accor-
dance with the Honor Code at the law
school.”

The Feb. 19 editorial criticized,
among other items, the provision
stating that if someone accused of an
honor violation fails to show up at a
closed hearing, the E.C. can decide
that person’s guilt or innocence in his
absence, which “violates the basic

right of the defendant to face his ac-
cusers,”’ according to the editorial.
In addition, it leaves the question of
who decides whether the accused’s
excuse for not appearing is
legitimate, open to discussion.

“A possible scenario is created
where the student could be convicted
in his absence. That student could
then bring the dismissal to a court of

law where the’ E.C.’s decision cotild *

be overturned. This would in effect
make the procedure in the White
Book illegal,’’ said Spratt.

The E.C., by virtue of the two-
thirds vote required to convict in
closed and open hearings, is unfair as
well, given the high burden of proof
on the defense to prevent a convic-
tion, according to the editorial. “A
system like that of the Student Con-
duct Committee (SCC), which re-
quires a three-fourths vote for con-
viction, may well provide more pro-

Honor society initiates

By MATHEW HORRIDGE
Staff Reporter

Twenty-four undergraduates and
one law student were initiated Tues-
day into Washington and Lee’s
chapter of Phi Beta Kappa at a con-
vocation at the University’s Lee
Chapel.

Phi Beta Kappa is a national honor
society for students with high grade-
point averages and good character.

Before listing this year’s inductees,
J. Brown Goehring, treasurer of the
Gamma of Virginia chapter, an-
nounced two award winners and two
new honorary members of the honor
society.

Steven F. Pockrass, a senior jour-
nalism major from Indianapolis, was
awarded the Pinney Prize. The Pin-
ney Prize was named after a former
professor, Edward L. Pinney, and is
voted upon by the Student Affairs
Committee.

James A. Sloat of Birdsboro, Pa.
was given the Phi Beta Kappa
Sophomore Award. This award is
given to the sophomore with the
highest grade-point average. Goeh-
ring said Gloat’s G.P.A. through four
terms is 4.194.

Minor L. Rogers, a professor of
religion at Washington and Lee, and
Thomas J. Pressley, a professor of

 

history at the University of Wash-
ington, who gave the convocation ad-
dress, were named honorary mem-
bers of the W&L chapter of Phi Beta
Kappa.

The seniors inducted were Jeffrey
P. Blomster of Emmaus, Pa.; Chris-
topher R. Carter of Chickasha,
Okla.; Eric D. Curren of Chicago;
Scott H. Gauvin of Cumberland, R.I;
Gerard R. Kehoe II of River Ridge,

Students of broadcast journalism
will soon be using a manual written
by a Washington and Lee professor to
settle questions of style, format, and
pronunciation.

Ronald H. MacDonald, a professor
of journalism, has recently had his.

book, ‘A Broadeast News Manual of ®

White Plains, N.Y.

“T had it in mind as a supplemen
tary text for broadcast newswriting
courses,’’ MacDonald said. He said

he started writing the book on a sab

batical leave during the fall of 1984,
but had been researching and collec-

MacDonald joined the W&L faculty
in 1969, after spending 13 years with
WDBJ-TV in Roanoke. While at
WDBJ, MacDonald was a reporter,

‘Most broadcast newsrooms, par-
ticularly the older, established sta

tection because of the higher burden
of proof placed on the prosecution
and the more knowledgeable and ex-
perienced appeals board,’’ the
editorial stated.

The editorial went on to criticize
several other provisions of the White
Book, including the lack of rules used
to determine the admissibility of
evidence, and the relatively light
penalties ‘given to E.C. represen-
tatives and students representing the
accused for breaching the confiden-
tiality of the case. Both, says Spratt,
are examples of problems that
“when taken together, raise the
quesiton of whether the E.C. does an
adequate job of upholding fairness.’’

students if they were satisfied with

the respondents answered in the
positive, the Law News editorial

The unrest during the 1930s and
the years between 1965 and 1975
brought to the surface many
potential threats to the U.S. Con-
stitution but at the same time,
proved the strength of the docu-
ment, according to Thomas J.
Pressley, a history professor at
the University of Washington.

Pressley, speaking at Tuesday’s
Phi Beta Kappa convocation at
Washington and Lee’s Lee Chapel,
said the two decades showed how
the flexibility of the Constitution
helped avoid revolution.

During the 1930s, Pressley said,
people were concerned with the
worst economic situation in the
nation’s history. There was
“widespread fear and questioning
of what was to come.”’

There were many demonstra-
tions across the United States call-
ing for economic aid and political
reform, Pressley said. In addi-
tion, there were calls for revolu-
tion, from both the ‘‘Marxist left”
and the ‘‘authoritarian right.”’

 

Pe eee ea re are

be made between the code and the
judicial system enforcing it.”

“There is always the possibility of
the creation of a separate judicial
system for the law school, as the vote
three years ago showed. (In that
vote, 158 to 141 voted against creating
a separate judicial system, with 80
percent of the students responding.)
In addition, one would have to ques-

~tion whether the E.C., composed
primarily of undergraduates, is a
jury of ‘“‘peers’ for the law students,
who are sometimes 10 or 20 years
older than the undergraduates.”

In spite of the criticisms of the
White Book provisions by the Law
News, third year law student and
E.C. representative Jim Humphreys
disagrees with Spratt’s assessment
of the E.C.

“The argument that the E.C. does

The decade starting in 1965 also
had many demonstrations, Press-
ley said, but those were more
varied and tended to be divided
between the 30-and-over genera-
tion and those younger than 30.

In addition to the famous rallies
for civil rights and the withdrawal
from Vietnam, people rallied for
the end of the draft, extended
rights for women, American In-
dians and Hispanic Americans,
and new lifestyles, Pressley said.

“There was polarization and
confrontation’’ everywhere, he
said. And again, people called for
revolution and changes in the Con-
stitution.

Despite the many calls for con-
stitutional change, Pressley said,
the greatest crisis for the Con-
stitution was the Watergate af-

fair

He said the founding fathers had
enough foresight to predict gov-
ernmental weaknesses and install
safeguards for citizens’ rights. By
bringing impeachment pro-
ceedings against Richard Nixon,
Congress supported the Constitu-
tional system.

Mock Convention is

re-slated for

By JOHN PENSEC
News Editor

 

Spring Term won't be the same
next year. It will be missing the mock
convention

The Executive Com :ittee of the
mock convention deci .ed it would be
for the overall good’ ; the convention
to move it from May to March. The
committee cited Super Tuesday at
the reason. Super Tuesday is when
many southern states will hold their
presidential primaries

John Gammage, co-chairman of
the convention, said that Super Tues-
day makes a May convention ob-
solete.

March ’88

He went on to say that those states
involved in Super Tuesday might
make a prediction for that day’s out-
come, but that is not definite.

The steering committee submitted
a proposal to the faculty executive
committee. The proposal concerned
itself with the Friday of the conven-
tion weekend. Usually there are no
classes that day, and the faculty E.C.
will decide if that will be the case
next year. If the committee approves

the resolution, the full faculty will
vote on it at their next meeting in
April.

Wa&L needs better Hill-student relations

 

MY VIEW
By Chris Carter

 

It takes no more that a quick
glance at last week’s Ring-tum Phi to
realize that we have a major problem
on this campus. One candidate for
Student Body President was running
on what amounts to an_anti-
administration platform — and was
considered by many to have had a
very good shot. Nearly all Big Three
candidates listed student/admin-
istration/faculty relations as a cen-
tral concern. Disparaging nicknames
for administrators are the order of
the day in student speech, and I have
myself begun to feel a growing
disillusionment upon the part of the
faculty towards their own admini-
stration. What is most discouraging
about all this is that the administra-
ar seems so completely oblivious to
it all.

A Phi editorial earlier this year ac-
cused President Wilson of viewing
everything through rose-colored
glasses. I just wish he had some
glasses so he could see at all. Under-
stand, I like President Wilson; I sup-
ported coeducation, and I believe

that in general, he has the school’s
best interests at heart. But I think
Washington Hall has become far too
ivory-coated. The recent registration
debacle is an excellent example of
what is happening around here far
too often.

Basically, the ideas behind im-
mediate class assignment were good
ones. Not only do students not have to
return in a month to pick up
schedules which will be immediately
changed during drop/add week, but,
when a few kinks are worked out, it
will help keep class sizes down and
make sure students are qualified to
take the courses in which they enroll.
But why didn’t someone tell us about
it? Nobody likes having a bomb drop-
ped on them, but that’s exactly what
happened to students last week. A
news release the week before which
explained not only the new pro-
cedure, but also why it was being
undertaken and what the difficulties
encountered and consequences might
be, would have gone a long way to
alleviate the almost universal
grumbling. Moreover, if the history
department was going to cut in half
the number of students it would take,
then it should have made students
—and advisors — aware of that fact
long before registration week. And if
the Administration is going to re-

quire such limits in enrollment, then
it needs to provide and make known
alternatives.

All this is a long way of saying that
around here, the left hand seems not
to know what the right hand is doing.
The faculty and administration often
think that the students are being
childish and obstinate; the students
think the Hill is just out to get them,
and neither side really makes any ef-
fort to understand the other. The
University Council, the perfect
organization to confront these issues,
wishes to dissolve itself, and hasn’t
played a significant role in Universi-
ty Affairs in the four years I’ve been
here. Since neither the council itself,
nor the University as a whole has
taken this group seriously, perhaps
other lines of communication might
be explored.

Obviously the E.C. is an excellent
forum for student expression. The
E.C. should make more of an effort
than it has this year, not only to ex-
press student opinion, but to explain
the reasoning behind it and to see
that the administration addresses the
issues which the Committee raises.
Certainly the Ring-tum Phi serves as
an important source of student opin-
ion; in this respect I think the Phi has
done a super job this year.

But what about the administration-

 

LETTERS

to-student side of the coin? One of
greatest criticisms which has been
leveled against President Reagan in
recent months is his failure to hold
press conferences. I think President
Wilson may have a similar problem.
He has almost no interaction with
students and is almost never seen by
them. I realize that his job does not
allow him to interact with students as
much as a normal faculty member,
but perhaps he could have monthly }
Sessions in which he would discuss a
current issue or problem and then,
ask for opinions and answer ques-
tions. Or perhaps he could send fre-
quent memos out to the student body,
as a friend of mine who transferred
from an area women’s college said:
happens all the time there.

happens all the time there.

At this stage of the game, the
method is rather unimportant: any
way of communicating more effec-,
tively and filling the Hill-to-student
vacuum would be appreciated and,
would help alleviate the feeling
which many students have that
administration doesn’t care about
the students and regards them as no
more than the cogs in some huge
State U. mill. But until some official
lines are established, students, facul-
ty, and administration alike are go-
ing to have to pay the penalty of
mutual distrust and disillusionment. ~

Cadet disputes facts of fraternity ‘brawl’

there are certain things the new administration should be
prepared to handle, regardless of today’s outcome.

First, the Menon Administration should be congratulated
for clarifying its position on scavenger hunts. Although it
took an incident of stealing federal property while on a
scavenger hunt to spur on the clarification, the phrase ‘“‘bet-
ter late than never”’ is applicable in this case.

The new administration should continue this process of
clarification and define specifically the jurisdiction of the
Honor System. It should also make clear its position on fake

IDs.

Another area that needs clarification is what constitutes an
honor violation. The White Book says that an honor violation

is lying, cheating, stealing and anything else the current stu-
dent generation deems dishonorable. But it doesn’t say how
the current student generation decides what else, in addition
to the trinity of offenses, is dishonorable.

While Washington and Lee continues the transition to a ful-
ly coeducated university, it is important that the represen-
tatives of the students, the Executive Committee, take a firm
stand on the issues of the day. The new administration needs

 

to let President Wilson and his administration know in clear
and specific terms those stands.

Valid ID only

When entering W&L, students are informed that the Honor
System is not a burden but a privilege of W&L students. Not
only can we schedule our class exams at our preference, but,
we are told, because the Honor System helps make W&L
students trustworthy, many area merchants accept our
checks and student I.D.’s as identification for checks and

proof of age.

Now it seems the G.H.Q. will not accept student I.D.’s as
proof of age. The G.H.Q. is not alone.

At Fancy Dress, the S.A.B. required that all students
show a valid driver’s license at proof of age.

Something is not right. Why are we issued useless student
identification cards that aren’t even recognized as valid iden-
tification by the organizations affiliated with the University?
How can the University expect the Lexington community to
trust the W&L community, when we don’t trust ourselves?

In last week’s edition of The Ring-
tum Phi, a letter from the Ex-
ecutive Committee appeared
under the title ‘‘A letter to the stu-
dent body.’’ The letter was ad-
dressed and sent to all W&L

fraternities and was printed in

ror.

is otherwise independent.

To the Editors:

In reference to the article concerning the
“brawl” at Phi Kappa Psi fraternity in the 5
March issue of your school newspaper there are
several discrepancies that need to be corrected.

In the article the following statement was
made: ‘“‘...none of the cadets who were at the
scene were identified upon returning to the post,
so no disciplinary action can be taken.’ This
statement is incorrect because six cadets have
each received penalties that include two months
confinement to the post, ten demerits, and thirty-
five penalty tours. (If a cadet receives more than
seventy demerits in a semester he is suspended
for one or two semesters; one penalty tour en-

of cadets.

ing the door,” in reference to reports made by

and Lee students attacked them. It may be true
that only two or three guys were working the
door; however, other members of the fraternity
were present when one cadet requested to speak
to Sham Mennon [sic], a member of the fraterni-
ty. The fraternity brothers (approximately five
to seven) assisted the “‘two or three guys work-
ing the door’”’ in removing the cadets from the
property.

Mr. McDonald also made the statement: ‘I
think it is pathetic they let them out like that.
They couldn’t have missed them leaving.’’ This
statement questions the integrity and honor of
V.M.I.’s administration. Capt. Willcockson, the
Deputy Commandant of V.M.I., stated that:
‘cadets crawl out through windows in the back
of the barracks and sneak off the back of the
post.” Several cadets who did leave through the
entrance to barracks were placed on report for
various offenses. To the claim that V.M.I. “‘let’’
these cadets out implies V.M.I.’s administration
condones this incident; this could not be further
from the truth.

The final discrepancy regards a statement
made by Capt. Willcockson. He stated: ‘‘...(1) he
had talked to the two cadets and (2) that he held
them responsible for the fact that six other
cadets now had police records.’’ However, these
statements were made on two separate occa-
sions and are mutually exclusive events. Cadets
Miller and Murray turned themselves in at ap-
proximately 3:00 a.m. Sunday morning and ask-
ed that they be allowed to accept full respon-
sibility for the entire incident in the eyes of the
Institute. In addition, cadets Miller and Murray
requested to see the Commandant of cadets,
which was granted. On Monday cadets Miller
and Murray met with the Commandant and
again requested that they be able to accept full
responsibility for the entire event. This I know to
be true because I was present for both events.

I am not trying to justify or pardon the actions
of certain members of the corps on 28 February
-1 March, but I am merely trying to clarify the
facts surrounding the event as they actually oc-
curred.

Cap and gown info given

An open letter to Seniors:

Graduation, it seems, is only a few minutes
away and we’d like to let you know about a few
items connected with that important event.

First, your cap and gown. Fortunately for you,
the University pays for the rental of your
academic regalia (last year the amount was
about $3,600.00). In order to pick up your cap and
gown, come to the Bookstore sometime between
May 25 and Graduation Day....bring $35.00 in
CASH for a deposit which will be refunded if you
return the cap and gown to us by 4 p.m. on
GRADUATION DAY. The $35 is refundable ON-
LY on June 4, but you are still responsible for
returning the cap and gown. The truth is: we
don’t actually want the money, we really want
the outfit back. You keep the tassel.

Second, your announcements. These will be for
sale at the Bookstore in packs of 5, starting April
20. Should you want to enclose your card with an
announcement, we have the best deal in town.
For only $3.00 you may order a pack of 25 name
cards with a choice of 3 type styles! See Debbie
in the Bookstore before April 30 for this special
offer.

HERE ARE THE DATES TO REMEMBER:

April 30 Invitations will be available. Name
cards may be ordered.

April 30 — Last day to order name cards at the
Bookstore.

May 25 June 4 — Pick up cap and gown and pay
$35.00 deposit.

June 4 at 4 p.m. — Last moment to get $35 back
for prompt return.

So, please ya’ll, read and heed — you’ve work-
ed so hard to get to this point in your life!

ID demands anger senior

To the Editors:

If spending four years at an university is sup-
posed to at least partially bridge the gap between
childhood and adulthood, I suppose a certain
amount of disillusionment is to be expected.
Despite this, I find the last veil pulled from my
eyes to be particularly shocking.

class, brithdate, and bore a picture of me. This
card, my “‘official University identification,” is
not accepted, however, at W&L functions, as I

licenses only, I was told.

This strikes me as a strange situation, for it

does not seem unreasonable to expect the
University to accept the cards it issues. I could
understand
someplace else, where it was not common
knowledge that W&L students are bound by the
Honor Code, but not on campus. Theoretically,

if the~-card was questioned

since W&L ‘‘gentlemen” are assumed to be
trustworthy, it is unnecessary to even have the
birthdate on the card.

Iam not such a wide eyed idealist that I expect
this to be the best of all possible worlds, but I do
resent the lack of trust this situation implies. If
W&L will not honor its own identification cards,
then where does this leave the student? Ap-
parently paying, if we are silly enough, ten
dollars for an unnecessary library card with a
picture.

The Great Debator

"Twas about this time last year that I was approached in the old milk
bar by the strangest of beasts, the Hippocritter. As everyone still
seems to remember, I had made all the necessary preparations and
purchases for Fancy Dress—including participation in the customary
pre-FD activities—but I somehow managed to miss the ball.

So there I was a couple of weeks ago, once again imbibing at the
milk bar, trying to build up my tolerance for this year’s safari into the

Elections need more ballot boxes

MY VIEW
By Abb Jones

Guess what? We had our “Big
Three’ election Monday and nobody
even knew about it. Whe I woke up
Monday morning, it was just by coin-
cidence that I remembered it was
election day, there had been so little
said about it earlier.

As I walked past ODK circle where
there has always been a voting box in
past elections, I saw nothing. (The
box was located next to the Com-
merce School front door.) I under-
stand that since it was raining they
wanted to keep the ballots and poll
workers dry. But as I looked towards
the library where there has always
been a voting box in the back mall in

the past, I saw nothing. (I was later
told the box was near the front door
of the library and not near the back
mall where it is usually located. OH.)

Sensing that a pattern was develop
ing, I searched for voting boxes in the
two freshmen quads. At least the
freshmen would see the boxes and be
reminded to vote, right? Wrong

Now unless the Voting Regulations
Board decided to move these boxes
inside the freshmen dorms, there
were only two boxes on campus for
the election, both moved from their
usual locations. (I don’t know what
happened at the law school, I wasn't
there.)

Now with a voter turnout of just
over 900 people, I ask this question -
what happened, VRB? Did you let the
rain scare you off? Did you just not

have enough volunteers to man more
than two voting boxes? (And before
you decide to write a letter to the Phi
telling me to volunteer to work the
polls next election, hold your shootin’
irons, fellas. | worked the freshmen
quad in front of Davis Dorm last elec-
tion.)

What I recommend is this —- why
not set up permanent indoor loca-
tions for voting boxes so as not to con-
fuse us students. Some prime loca-
tions would be the dining hall foyer,
the C-school foyer, the library foyer
(OK, so you beat me to that one), and
the law school foyer.

Approximately 50 representatives
from the Lexington, Washington and
Lee and the Virginia Military In-
stitute communities met in Wash-
ington and Lee’s University Center
Wednesday to discuss relations
among the groups.

After meeting for three and a half
hours in an ‘agenda-setting
meeting,”’ the group emerged with
many ideas to improve relations
among the constituencies.

Among the ideas presented were
more interaction between students,
cadets and townspeople; a coor-
dinated calendar listing events on
both campuses and in town; and bet-
ter communication among the three
groups.

“I think an exercise like this is
very helpful,” said Joseph King, Lex-

cussed here.”

but as it stands, the vote required is
reasonable and fair for the accused

While Humphreys believes that the
creation of a separate judicial entity
in the law school does not have the
support of the law students, the issue
and the criticisms raised in the Law
News may well last until the pro-
blems are resolved. As the editorial
states, “...assuming arguendo that

proving the system of enforcement to
make it more fair still exists.”’

Professor

writes on
oratory

From Staff Reports

 

Halford R. Ryan, professor of
speech at Washington and Lee, has
published his third book. “‘American
Orators of the Twentieth-Century:
Critical Studies and Sources’’ is the
first volume on American oratory in
30 years, according to Ryan.

Co-edited with Bernard Duffy of
Clemson University, the book is
published by Greenwood Press in
Westport, Conn.

The book is composed of 58 essays
on leading presidents, jurists,
senators, congressmen, demago-
gues, clergymen, feminists, and ac-
tivists. Each contributor discusses
the orator’s training, rhetorical pur-
poses, major speeches and ad-
dresses, and bibliography and
chronology of major speeches

Ryan contributed essays on Harry
Emerson Fosdick, Harry S. Truman
and Franklin D. Roosevelt. He also
created a glossary of rhetorical
terms. Ryan and Duffy are working
on a companion volume for pre-20th-
century orators.

Elliott speaks on Reagan

By MATHEW HORRIDGE
Staff Reporter

 

If the people in Lee Chapel last
week thought they were hearing
another Ronald Reagan, they were
—kind of.

In fact, the approximately 60 peo-
ple were hearing Ben Elliott, a
former chief of Reagan’s speech-
writing department.

With the last part of his speech
coinciding with Reagan’s response to
the Tower Commission’s report, El-
liott focused his attention on what
Reagan will need to do in response to
the Iran affair.

“His presidency is really on the
line,” Elliott said. He said Howard
Baker will make a good chief of staff
for Reagan, but Reagan needs to do
more than make personnel changes.

He needs to spend at least the next
three months making sure he knows
every aspect of what is going on in
the White House to regain people’s
confidence in him as a competent
leader, Elliott said.

Elliott said the greatest damage to
Reagan may be that people will
believe Reagan is more concerned

with looking good on television than
he is about national affairs.

Donald Regan, who resigned as
Reagan’s chief of staff, may have
been Reagan’s downfall in the Iran
affair, Elliott said.

Elliott said he noticed that Reagan
had become more removed from the
day-to-day operations of the White
House since Regan became chief of
staff. He said Regan did not keep the
president well-informed on many
many important matters, including
the Iran affair and the latest Reagan-
Gorbachev summit in Reykjavik.

Regan did not tolerate anyone
whose ideas differed from his own,
Elliott said, and those people were
often fired. The White House became
hierarchical under Regan: Regan
worked for Reagan, Regan’s staff
worked for Regan and the rest of the
White House worked for Regan’s
staff, Elliott said.

Elliott went on to discuss other
aspects of the Reagan presidency. He
said ‘‘everything Reagan does, from
the moment he goes to the Oval Of-
fice...to the time he watches televi-
sion at night, is stage managed.”

Reagan’s image as someone who

Z aay Ye An
Ve
We,

understands every person is genuine,
Elliott said. Elliott called Reagan ‘“‘a
slice of America,” and one who has a
joke or anecdote for almost every
situation.

Ironically, on the same
Reagan said his wife, Nancy,
not play a part in his decision-making
process, Elliott said Mrs. Reagan
plays a larger part than most people
may think.

Nancy Reagan does not sit in on
Cabinet meetings like Rosalyn
Carter did, Elliot said, but she wields
much greater influence than the
former first lady.

Elliott said Mrs. Reagan was very
much responsible for the resignation
of Regan and added that Secretary of
State George Shultz may be on the
first lady’s ‘short list” for not sup-
porting Reagan during the Iran af-
fair.

“Nancy Reagan has her own sense
of what this man needs to be a great
president,”’ Elliott said.

ject of the University’s Interfraterni-
ty Council and the Executive Com-

Nutrition
in the

spotlight

 

From Staff Reports

 

What is the effect of one Twinkie on
the average college student? How
about two?

Is a chef’s salad really better for
you than a plate of nachos covered
with picante sauce?

Students at Washington and Lee
will have a chance to answer those
and other questions about their diet
on March 18 at a nutrient analysis
workshop in Evans Dining Hall. The
workshop is sponsored by Washing-
ton and Lee Food Services in honor of
National Nutrition Month.

Michele Garand, the food service
nutritionist from James Madison
University, and JoAnne Willis, a con-
sultant dietician from Stonewall
Jackson Hospital, will conduct the
workshop from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.
Students will fill out a worksheet
identifying the foods they have eaten
that day. They will then receive a
computer analysis of that day’s in-
take.

Garand and Willis will analyze the
program and make recommenda-
tions on how the diet can be improved
if it is deficient in certain nutrients.
They will also answer questions re-
garding diet planning.

Earlier that day, Sharon Buckner,
a nutrition educator from the Dairy
and Food Nutrition Council, will offer
tips on nutrition fitness. Buckner will
offer tips on how to calculate calorie
needs, how to eat right but eat light,
how to lose ‘“‘blubber,”’ and how to ex-
ercise options available to control
weight.

Buckner will conduct her pro-
grams in Evans Dining Hall from

11:30a.m. to1:15p.m.

On campus housing will become
more a part of Washington and Lee
University due to the opening of
Gaines Hall next September.

The change to coeducation in the
fall of 1985 presented Washington and
Lee with the problem of over-
crowding in freshmen dorms. As a
result, many rooms designed as
singles were converted into doubles,
making for cramped living condi-
tions.

Construction began on Gaines Hall
last year as a way to solve this pro-
bliem. Baker Dorm will now be used
to house freshmen. Gaines Hall and
Woods Creek will be used to house the
main body of upper classmen and

according to John. Both law students
and upper classmen will be able to
live on campus if they wish.

“We are responding to the stu-
dent’s needs and interests,’ said
John. Where Woods Creek provides
students with separated living
quarters, John hopes that Gaines will
provide even more. ‘‘We are hoping
for a greater sense of community and
cohesiveness at the upper class
level,”’ he said.

William J. Stearns, who rents
apartments to approximately 150
Washington and Lee students each
year, said he is having a typical year.
About 90 percent of his property is
already rented. He said that the new
dorm has not really affected him.

“Don’t Grieve After Me,”’ a travel-
ing exhibit that explores through
photographs the black experience in
Virginia from 1619 to 1986, is current-
ly on display in the lower lobby of the
University Library.

Organized by Hampton University
with support from the Colonial
Williamsburg Foundation and the
Virginia Foundation for the
Humanities and Public Policy, the
exhibit will be on display at
Washington and Lee through March
10.

The exhibit title ‘Don’t Grieve
After Me,” was adopted from a tradi-
tional Virginia song sung by blacks to
anticipate and celebrate emancipa-
tion. The 25-panel exhibit uses over 70
photographs to explore themes cen-
tral to the history of black Virgin-
ians.

Among the themes examined by
the exhibit are the migration pat-
terns and establishment of a black
Virginian culture; the contributions
of blacks through the range of their
skills and professions; the examina-
tion of family, community, and
religious expressions; and the
evaluation of educational achieve-
ments, community struggles, and ac-
complishments.

In addition to ‘Don’t Grieve After
Me,” an ex“ibit on ‘Lexington’s
Black Community” is on display in
the Boatwright Room of the Universi-
ty Library. The exhibit is drawn from
manuscripts, books, photos, and
handbills from the University
Library’s collection and from the
private collections of area residents.
“Lexington’s Black Community”
will be on display until June.

The book evolved into a general
reference work at the suggestion of
the publisher, MacDonald said.
About two-thirds of the book covers
general usage guidelines, while the
rest of the book explains the
mechanics of broadcast news writing
— the page format, how to indicate
videotape cues, how the wire ser-
vices work, handling of numbers, and
use of abbreviations and contrac-
tions.

Nine appendices to the book in-
clude a review of the ethics of jour-
nalism, an explanation of the role of
the Federal Communications Com-
mission, and a list of the nations of
the world and the pronunciation of
their capital cities.

In 1970, MacDonald co-authored a
pronunciation guide for the Virginia
Associated Press Broadcasters.

Noel T. Boaz, director of the
Virginia Museum of Natural History,
will lecture on ‘‘Recent Research in

some people question the need for
student IDs. The student ID is to
“certify that you are a student,” said
Atkins. He added that it serves the
same purpose as a library card or a
charge card in the bookstore.

Atkins also added that the student
ID can be used as a “secondary
means in order to check if the
driver’s license is valid and not
tampered with.” The GHQ has made
“a reasonable effort” to ensure that
people know the guidelines of the
identification policy, Atkins said.
Students must be able to prove their
ages because if the ABC comes in
they will want to know how the age of
the student was proven. ‘“‘It is possi-
ble to be a senior and not be of legal
drinking age,’’ said Atkins in ref-
erence to the incident involving Ran-
dolph.

Three of the local restaurants, the
Subway, The Palms and Spanky’s,

doubt about the validity of the
license, such as the presence of any ,
type of alteration, two IDs are re-

quired. And a Spanky’s manager said! '
they ‘‘require two IDs and one must .

be a Virginia driver’s license.”’ In the
case of an out-of-state license, the
license will be examined and a deci- ;
sion will be made.

“Most of the time, only people in '
Virginia can drink,” added the .
manager. He said the policy was im-
plemented two months ago, and so ’
far there have not been any problems +
or complaints about it.

The Constitution has provided
“a framework in which substi-
tutes for revolution could be
found,’ Pressley said, and this
has proven to be its strongest
point.

“IT would rather live with the

said,

This year marks the 200th an-

Generals sting Hornets
for first ODAC victory ever

 

By DAVID EMRICH
; Sports Editor

 

“For the Washinton and Lee
,,lacrosse team, last Saturday’s 16-6
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
‘win over Lynchburg was a lot like
,.collection time at church—everyone
contributed.

« Led by sophomore Neill Redfern

_ With four goals, and John Ware with 2
Zoals and five assists, nine different

«W&L players had a hand in the scor-
ing. Five of those players, including
Ware, scored twice for the Generals.
All in all, head coach Dennis Daly
described the afternoon as ‘‘a team
‘effort.”’

« But don’t get the idea that the

“Generals put the game away early

“and spent the rest of the afternoon
thinking about what remained of
Fancy Dress weekend. That was cer-
tainly not the case. W&L held a slim
,one-goal (5-4) lead at the half and
didn’t seem to be playing well at all.

' “T felt we would win if we ex-
ecuted,’’ said Daly. ‘In the first half
I didn’t think we were executing
'well.”’

Yet, despite playing well below

their potential, the Generals were

‘still leading at the half—mainly due
to the work of junior Sandy Harrison.

 

Senior Roby Mize hits a volley against Millersville on Tuesday.

Harrison went an amazing 15 of 18
on faceoffs for a percentage of 83.

“If we hadn’t been winning the
faceoffs in the first half it might not
have been so close,”’ said Daly.

“Sandy [Harrison] had an un-
believable day,”’ said Daly. ‘‘With
him controlling the ball and Churchy
{senior goalie John Church] playing
fairly well I can’t say I was concern-
ed with our play in the first half.

“I wasn’t pleased,’’ continued Da-
ly, “but I wasn’t concerned.”’

Daly, however, had to be pleased
with the team’s play in the second
half, particularly in the third period.

Led by Harrison’s perfect 9 of 9
performance in the third quarter’s
faceoffs, the Generals pumped in
eight unanswered goals to blow the
game wide open. This, combined
with the Hornet’s feeble two goal ef-
fort in the second half, gave the
Generals their first ODAC victory
ever.

“In the third period Church made
some key saves and some good outlet
passes and I think that ignited us,”’
said Daly.

“In the second half we played well.
We stood still and passed rather than
move around a lot.

“We started taking shots,” con-
tinued Daly. “A lot of it was just
realizing we made mistakes and cor-

recting them.”

With their first conference win
under their belts, the Generals now
turn their attention towards the top
Division III teams in the country.

Thursday afternoon at 3 p.m. the
Generals face Ohio Wesleyan, a
game that means a great deal in
terms of D-III national rankings.

Ohio Wesleyan holds the No. 3 spot
in the D-III hierarchy, behind last
year’s championship finalists Hobart
and Washington College.

“This game will be a good
barometer of where we belong in
Division III,”’ said Daly.

“They [Ohio Wesleyan] finished
third last year and they’ve only
graduated three players.

“We're going to find out whether or
not we have the ability, and if we are
a top four team,”’ said Daly.

LAX FACTS ... Redfern leads the
team in scoring with six goals and
five assists for 11 points, Ware is sec-
ond with two goals and six assists for
eight points, and junior Robbie Stan-
ton is third with four goals and an
assist for five points .. Ohio
Wesleyan is coached by former W&L
all-America Mike Pressler... In addi-
tion to Thursday's game, the Gen-
erals will also host Swarthmore on
Saturday at 2 p.m.

Netmen look flat
in 7-2 loss to Tech

By MIKE SHADY
Assistant Sports Editor

 

All great teams have those days
when they come out flat and are not
emotionally in the swing of things.
Yesterday was one of those days for
the Washington and Lee men’s tennis
team.

The Generals, ranked No. 2 in Divi-
sion III preseason polls behind defen-
ding champion Kalamazoo, Mich.,
traveled to Blacksburg, Va. to
face Virginia-Tech, only’to lose, 7-2.
The defeat came just a day after the
Generals’ 8-1 shellacking of
Millersville on Monday and left the
team’s early season record at 2-1.

The main problem for the Generals
yesterday was, according to head
coach Gary Franke, an emotional
one and not physical in nature.

“T was a little disappointed,” said
Franke. “‘We were not real intense.
This was a team we beat in the fall.

“We lost all the doubles matches

Solid start for Stickley and baseball despite two

 

By STU SHELDON
Staff Reporter

" First-year head coach Jeff Stickley
has the Washington and Lee baseball
team, which is currently 1-2, off to a
very promising start, The Generals
‘opened their season on Saturday,
splitting a doubleheader with the
West Virginia Tech Bears and con-
tinued it on Monday with a loss to
Lock Haven State.

On Monday the Generals faced
Lock Haven and absorbed their sec-
ond loss, 3-2, ina game that was call-
ed half-way through the eighth in-
ning.

Stickley felt that the team played
well against Lock Haven, and that
starting sophomore pitcher ‘‘Richard
Grace was a surprise. He pitched a
really good game. We can do well if
we keep those three starters [Grace,
senior Bill Schoettelkotte, and junior
Carter Steuart] pitching well.”

In Saturday’s double header, W&L

Castle: Academic all-American

 

‘From Staff Reports

 

For the fourth time in as many
years, a member of the Washington
‘and Lee wrestling team has been
named an Academic all-American.

Junior Steve Castle, a chemistry
major from New Canaan, Connec-
ticut is the latest student-athlete to
earn the honor.

Castle, a co-captain this past
season, went 19-5 at 118 Ibs., and plac-
ed third in the NCAA Southeastern
»Regionals held here at W&L.

“T am extremely happy for Steve,”’
said head coach Gary Franke. ‘‘He is
one of the most well-rounded student-
athletes I have had the privilege to
coach.”

Castle follows Tim Valliere (1984),
Jeff Dixon (1985), and Larry Anker
(1985) as W&L wrestlers named
Academic all-America.

Castle travelled with sophomore
Richard Redfoot to Buffalo, N.Y. last
weekend to compete in the NCAA
Division III National Championships.

Both wrestlers lost in the first
round.

Haralson: 1st team All-South

 

From Staff Reports

 

Senior Basketball player Jefferson
“Harralson topped off his extremely
»suecessful year by being named to
‘the National Association of Basket-

ball Coaches All-South Atlantic First
‘Team.

Harralson, 6-6, is a business major
from Princeton, Kentucky.

He became the Generals 11th ail-
, time scorer, finishing his career with

1,219 points.
Last season, he led the team in

scoring and rebounding, averaging
21 points and 7.8 boards per game in
1987-88.

Harralson was named the Most
Valuable Player in each of this
season's two W&L Invitaional Tour-
naments.

He was also selected to the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference First
Team.

“Tam very pleased to see Jefferson
receive this honor,”’ said W&L head
coach Verne Canfield. ‘“‘He played
well all year and really earned all the
accolades he has received.’

 

lost the first game 2-1, with Schoet-
telkotte pitching what Stickley called
“a great game.” West Virginia Tech
pushed in the winning run on a pass-
ed ball.

Stickley also praised the consistent
performance of the defense, which
became vital in the second-game
turnaround. ‘“‘We get better every
day,” said Stickley.

‘We had a chance to win. We went
to extra innings and left the winning

run on base twice. Our bats cooled
off,” Stickley said.

Led by Steuart, the Generals took
the field for the second game, which
W&L eventually won by a score of
12-1.

Perhaps the greatest highlight of
the second game was the defense,
which not only held the Bears to a

single run, but also completed six
double plays.

“We turned six doubles, one more
than all of last year. All six, however,

should have been turned. Like bat-
ting, we work on it every day,’’ com-
mented Stickley.

Sophomore Chris Cunningham re-
lieved Steuart in the sixth inning and
earned a save by keeping the
Generals out in front.

Stickley mentioned the importance
of the bullpen in the upcoming games
against Christopher Newport (away)
on Saturday and the University of
Pittsburg at Bradford (home) on
Sunday.

and that was kind of a surprise. We
didn’t perform well as a team.”

Franke cited sophomore Bobby
Matthews and junior David McLeod
as the two players performing at the
top of their games.

“Matthews and McLeod are play-
ing real well,” he said. ‘“‘We need to
work on our doubles but right now no
one stands out from the others.”

Millersville was a ‘‘good win,”’ said
Franke, but the Generals will have to
be prepared both mentally and
physically for the numerous matches
in the upcoming week. The team
plays five matches in the next six
days.

“This is a big week,” said Franke.

VOLLEYS: The Generals’ present
lineup -- Singles: No. 1-sophomore

losses

“Both teams are good, better than
WV Tech. We will have to play well to
beat them. [The] games will [both)
come down to the pitching. If we do it
right we can win,” he said.

Pitt/Bradford, an NAIA Division I
team will prove to be quite a
challenge, as will Newport, who
plays in a tougher league with a
longer season. Stickley and his team,
however, are confident in their
abilities, and are going to put on quite
a show.

Sophomore John Ware in action versus Virginia.

f

By JOHN PACKETT
Staff Reporter

 

In Saturday’s lacrosse game
John Ware scored two goals and
had five assists to make him
Washington and Lee’s Athlete of
the Week.

Ware said he felt happy about
the way he played in the game
against Lynchburg College.

“T don’t think I played too well
in the game against Virginia the
week before, but I was happy with
the way I played on Saturday,”
said Ware.

The Generals win gives them a
1-1 overall record and a 1-0 record
in the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference.

Ware said that the Generals
played well in the second half of
Saturday’s game.

“Against Virginia we played
well but we were just outmanned.
In the Lynchburg game we didn’t
get things rolling until the second
half,”’ said Ware.

When the Generals host Ohio

Wesleyan today, Ware feels that
the team is going to have to play
well.

“Ohio Wesleyan is a good team
and we are going to need and ef-
fort like Saturday’s second half to
beat them,” said Ware.

Ohio Wesleyan is currently
ranked third nationally in Divi-
sion III.

A Generals’ win would be a big
boost for the team since moving
down to Division III, said Ware.

“T think the move was for the
better because now we can actual-
ly have a chance at accomplishing
something,” said Ware.

‘We have a chance at playing in
the Division III post-season tour-
nament.”

Ware said that a big help for the
team was their training trip to
Florida.

“We were able to put in most of
our offense and defense while we
were down there. If we had stayed
here we would have not been able
to practice in the snow.”

Ware is a sophomore from Rich-
mond, Va. where he attended St.
Christopher’s High School. He
was captain of the lacrosse and
soccer teams.

Husker Dii: Ransacking the ‘Warehouse’

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Entertainment Editor

 

Some two hundred years ago,
Samuel Johnson wrote: ‘“‘Human life
is every where a state in which much
is to be endured, and little to be en-
joyed.” Which aren’t exactly comfor-
ting words, but they ring a great deal
truer than a many of us would care to
admit.

Although I could be wrong, I havea
good feeling that Husker Du would
probably agree with the Great Lex-
icographer. On the group’s stunning
new double album, Warehouse: Songs
and Stories, life is confronted and en-
dured over and over again, wrestled
into bracing pop hooks and presented
at breakneck speed. Of the twenty
tracks, perhaps two or three don’t
manage to click; yet even these
minor low points are worth an entire
roomful of Bon Jovis or Glass Tigers.

Without question, Husker Du is the
premier American rock and roll
band. They are already well on their
way to acheiving R.E.M.-like suc-
cess, and if Warehouse doesn’t do it
for them, something is certainly
wrong. No band on earth planet
works harder than these guys. Since
1984, they have released a double
album called Zen Arcade, two blister-
ing affirmations of hardcore promise

and pop smarts, and a major label
debut that saw the band turn semi-
acoustic without losing any of their
awesome power. But that wasn’t
enough, because with each outing,
Husker Du kept promising more:
Warehouse: Songs and Stories fulfills
that promise conclusively.

Songwriting credit is split evenly
between guitarist Bob Mould and
drummer Grant Hart. Perhaps
because Mould is a guitarist, his
tracks on the whole hold up better
than Hart’s; nonetheless, the whole
set rings true from start to finish.
Opening up with Mould’s These Im-
portant Years,’’ the album moves
gracefully from mind-blowing,
psycho-therapy rock to hook-laden
pop brilliance.

Mould’s tracks center around in-
ventive riffs, punctuated by the
band’s driving rhythm section. The
melody to ‘“‘Ice Cold Ice” spirals up
and over the top with gritty power,
while ‘“‘Could You Be The One’’ and
“Turn It Around’’ possess ready-for-
radio hooks and appropriately clever
lyrics. There are enough potential
hits here to fill two or three Boston
records, and Husker Du make it all
sound so easy.

But they know nothing is really
easy. On “It’s Not Peculiar,’’ Mould
presents a view of life that agrees
more with Johnson than it does
Howard Jones or any other current

pop music psychiatrist. He sings,
“Taking all of this is taking all of me
/ wish I had the energy.’’ When was
the last time you heard a rock group
announce, “You've got to learn to
compromise / To live inside the
other’s life’ when it comes to dealing
with complex human relationships?
There’s none of this naive, ain’t-the-
world-groovy garbage about Husker
Du: the human condition is much
more complicated than that.

Relationships come _ together
tenuously and fall apart painfully on
Warehouse, and why shouldn’t they?
When did someone announce that pop
music must be escapist tripe? Check
out Hart’s “She’s A Woman (And
Now He’s A Man)” and Mould’s
“Turn It Around’’ for a glimpse at
this band at the height of their
powers.

The Clash tried to imitate the
tangle of modern life with this kind of
barrel-house complexity, but their
naive global politics made it all
sound too utopian. Husker Du aren’t
concerned with politics of the exter-
nal sort, however, and that is why th
they succeed so wonderfully. As it
says in the liner notes: ‘Revolution
starts at home, preferably in the
bathroom mirror.” You could do
worse than listen to this record, and
you couldn’t do much better. Put
these guys at the top of the charts,
where they rightfully belong.

‘The Mission’ is this year’s finest film

By MICHAEL TUGGLE
Movie Critic

 

And this is the message we have heard
from Him and to announce to you, that
God is light, and in him there is no
darkness at all all.

John 1:5

In the late 1750's, the leaders of the
Spanish and Portugese cities in
Paraguay, Brazil, and Argentina
commissioned mercenaries and
slave traders to apprehend the South
American indians from their jungle
sanctuaries to serve as_ slaves.
Though the indians were little match
for Portugese artillery, the did have
one shining hope.

Director Roland Joffe now
presents the story of that hope in his
stunning motion picture, The Mission,
starring Jeremy Irons and Robert
DeNiro. On the surface, it is a simple
story about the Jesuit priests who
fought the Portugese governors for
the existence of the South American
missions. However, it is Joffes in-
tense study of the juxtaposition of
good and evil in society and man that
gives the film its awsome power.

Father Gabriel (Irons) and
Rodrigo Mendoza (DeNiro) are
Jesuits who resisist the Portugese
heads of state’s attempted abolition
of the missions. However, this is
made difficult by the personal strug-
gle they share. While they both fight
for the freedom of the missions,
Gabriel believes that the only way to

deal with the Portugese is to pray
and love, while Mendoza, a former
mercenary and slave trder, recog-
nizes the futility of pacifism and
chooses to fight them. Mendoza’s
decision creates a conflict within
himself, as he is too a Jesuit and
must love, not fight.

Obviously, the doctrine. ‘‘... the
greatest of these is love’’ does not
hold true unconditionally. The Por-
tugese threaten the indian’s home
and they are forced to choose
whether to give in to slavery and
death or to fight. As would any man
faced with losing his freedom, the in-
dians choose to fight. They are
massacred and the mission is
destroyed. However, from this
destruction comes life and hope for
the indians who live past the coming
of the Portugese and remember the
mission as it had really been: a sanc-
tuary of love and protection from the
evils of the outside world.

There are not enough superlatives
to possibly describe the quality and
power of The Mission. Robert DeNiro
and Jeremy Irons are brilliant and
truly have an injustice done to them
by not receiving Oscar nominations
for Best Actor. If there is any justice
in the world, cinematographer Chris
Menges’ photography of Columbia
and Argentina will win him a follow-
up Oscar to go with the one he receiv-
ed in 1984 for the The Killing Fields.
Roland Joffe has an excellent chance
to win the Directoral Directorial
